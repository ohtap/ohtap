During the days I was with the NAACP, I almost could bet you money on that, if they arrested a Negro, they were going to take him out on the outskirts of town somewhere first and beat him up, and then bring him back and throw him in jail. And hardly anybody ever was put in jail that came out without being beaten. And they always said they (cont) sometimes would have to tie their feet and hands and beat them down and all that to subdue them. But I never could understand how a man with his feet tied and his hands tied had to be knocked around They have stomped men in the jail that were accused of rape.

1	Adair, Christia	BWOH	1893	1890	TX	Black or African American	Bachelor's degree	Widowed	RBNF 1	1977.0	84	So I was the first volunteer secretary of the branch here. Well, we had some pretty strong cases, cases like the DiMarco-Bob White case. Most of the cases were rape cases where white people used to become dissatisfied and disgruntled about a thing. The best way they could do, some white woman would holler that she'd been raped by a Negro or ventured to rape, or something like that, and of course that meant a burned or lynched Negro. And so this happened down at Conroe. But we were able to get a lawyer - this was one of NAACP's first projects - and a lawyer that won that case in our favor. And the day of the trial when he was declared innocent and turned loose, they shot him right in the jail house, I mean right in the courthouse down in Conroe, that's in Montgomery County. Well, those things were so exciting to me, I did not know that people could be treated like people in Houston were being treated. Not only in cases like that, but in jail, prisoners generally, why, they would beat up people and anything they wanted to do and kill people. And NAACP then became the sole interest of mine.

"But as I said, the Atlanta riot had occurred the week before the opening. And the teachers, of course, were wary, because most of our teachers were Caucasians, and Atlanta University had been denied a state compensation because it was an integrated school. And, of course, the teachers were mostly from the North. And we, I suppose, weathered it and we got along all right. No one bothered us coming through town because we were an orderly group, of course. GFB: So how did you get across town, did you walk? KA: We walked. It seems so strange to me now to see the young folk hop in the car and run around the block to see a friend. We walked and from where I lived...and I lived in a block where they have the King Center. Our lot was just about in the center of that block, bet
een Boulevard and Jackson, on the south side of the street. And every day from there, I walked to old Atlanta University.

7	Ruffin, Goldie Byrd	RTRB	1926	1920	CA	Indigenous American or Alaska Native	Graduate or professional degree	Widowed	1	2006.0	80	child abuse	"There is the National Plan of Action. This has a few views on its implementation. There was a National Plan of Action in a meeting that this country held in Houston on women's issues, after Mexico City. So to take it... The fifty-six state and territorial conventions forwarded the recommendations summarized in this, for amendment and ratification by two thousand delegates, apart from gender, the most diverse elected body ever assembled. Following each item, there is a summary assessment by the National Women's Conference Committee of its status in March 1984. Now the National Women's Conference Committee was a four-hundred-member committee, appointed by the president of the United States. I was one of them. So this formed an organization really, that met annually, all during the decade, on the national level as the United States women. So this is their summary of, taken alphabetically, arts and humanities, for example, ""equitable representation in management, government, and decision-making. For structures in libraries. and museums and media and higher education, blind judging whenever possible. Strides have been made in public awareness of the outstanding contributions by women in the arts and humanities. Funding and recognition, however, have not kept pace with women's expectations. The National Endowment for the Arts, the Humanities have faced large cutbacks, severely limiting access and opportunity for all. Network and coalition activities have linked women in the arts and organizations."" Now network was, when we got back from Copenhagen, that was the buzzword. It came out of that conference in Copenhagen. Networking, and women began to do it more with organizations, reaching outside themselves and outside their own organizations. ""Network and caucus in the humanities, and women's studies programs have advanced women's contributions. What had been an emerging focus on women in National Endowment for the Arts and in NEA programming has been curtailed, only because of the cutbacks since 1984."" Then there was battered women, and organizations set up stations for battered women as a result of these women's issues that came up. Then there was business support for women entrepreneurs through government-related activities and contracts, including of women-owned business and S.B.A. targeting. And that 1978 report, ""Unequal Business Enter- 73Ã¯Â»Â¿prise in America"" prompted training programs to assist women entrepreneurs, that has improved. Then ""child abuse, support for prevention and treatment of abused children, including training for public awareness and counseling, and service and justice agencies""; we know that that has improved, public awareness. And ""child care, federally supported efforts and legislation at all levels to promote child care programs. Labor and business support in education and parenthood."" Then minority women, recognition in every plan, ""recommendation applies fully for all minority women, with recognition of additional burdens through institutionalized bias and inadequate data. Enforcement of anti-discrimination laws as they affect education, housing, health, employment. Recognition of special needs of American Indian, Alaskan native women and Asian-Pacific American women, Hispanic women, Puerto Rican women and Black women,"" all of that has improved because it was brought to the attention through these national conferences, and that sort of thing. ""Offenders and older women, education, effective appointment to office, and credit, disabled women."" all of those subjects have...rape, that sort of thing. ""Reproductive freedom and rural women, sexual preference, statistics and the welfare, poverty, continued committee of the conference, establishment of a body under public law""; this organization was established under public law to consider steps to achieve recommendations of this conference, and to convene a second conference. So it started in '78, '79. '80. '81. '82. and in '83. we met in Detroit. Then the homemakers and the insurance and international affairs, media, and all of those subjects were out then, pointed up to and assessed as to the improvement. This is really the crux of the women's movement after it moved away from the bra burning and those types of extreme things that existed at first among the women's movement. So much so, that people didn't want to be called a feminist, because it meant that to them. But the feminist movement and the women's movement now, they have legitimate issues to discuss ."

But I do know the facts and I'll give them to you. These are facts from friends whom I know. There were within the race different colors of people and, because I knew some things that came to me from somewhere, that didn't disturb me.

I'll name the place and the people who lived there would not object to it because they talked freely. When I taught at Snow Hill, Alabama, I had a friend, a young man, a friend in Dothan, Alabama, who was from Beatrice, Alabama. Beatrice, Alabama, is near Snow Hill. A friend in Snow Hill said she would take me to Longmire's home. Longmire was then in Washington studying to be a lawyer. She says, ""I'll take you to Longmire's home. You can meet his people."" She took us to Beatrice, Alabama. And we stayed in a home where there was a woman, a dark woman, and several bright men and women. We heard one fellow say, ""I'm going to get up and go to the big house and look after my father."" This was as late as ...I taught at Snow Hill in 1924. And I asked, I said, ""Where did he say he's going?"" They said, ""His father is white and lives in that big house up there.""

When we looked at the note, he wanted to be her boyfriend, you know, and she took the note, she and I went to him and tore it up and threw it in his face, and told him, ""You take your mother out,"" to that white policeman. Then again, I was on the platform of a train, a train platform in the South, in a little place called Bisale, walking up and down, waiting for the train to come, and the white man was sitting on the back of the station, with his back, his chair reared back, and he was talking to a white lady across the track, but I passed between him and the white lady, and oh, he got so mad. ""Didn't you see me talking to a white lady?"" You know? So I answered him back, kind of flip way, and I remember my cousins in the town were very upset because I did. Because they thought that some harm would come to me for doing that. But he said, ""Hey nigger,"" you know, ""didn't you see me talking to that white lady?"" Well naturally, I resented that.

In 1968, I retraced my steps from the first trip, and did a documentary comparing the Africa that was colonial with the current Africa that is independent. Everybody was writing about the woes of Africa, the problems they had, but nobody was mentioning the advancements that were being made. For instance, I attended some of the independence affairs like Congo or Zaire. I was there when their independence was announced, staying at the same hotel as Dr. Ralph Bunche. When I say we, I mean the photographer and myself- It was so calm and quiet right after the celebration that we went on to the Cameroons. A few days later, the Congolese were pointing guns at Dr. Bunche. When I got to Ghana, I was able to meet the first refugee plane coming out of the Congo.

Specifically she ended up being a chemistry and biology major. But what it means is that in the middle of World War II, while her parents were in internment camp, she as a Japanese American woman traveled alone by train across the country from Arizona to Rhode Island. And from what I understand, there was a part of the journey where there was an F.B.I. agent who was assigned to her. And basically tailed her and shadowed her the whole time, which she remembers as being her great fortune because it meant that people weren't harassing her. For a Japanese American woman traveling alone across the country. And so she thinks of this F.B.I. agent as like a little guardian angel, in some ways, though she would not have used that phrase. But anyway, so she came to Pembroke and attended 14 Pembroke, and I believe she was the first Japanese American woman to attend Pembroke college. While she was here I believe there was maybe one other Japanese American student who I think was a man, who was a Brown student. I could be wrong about that, but I'm pretty sure she wasn't the first Japanese American at Brown, but I do think she was the first Japanese American woman.

But what it means is that in the middle of World War II, while her parents were in internment camp, she as a Japanese American woman traveled alone by train across the country from Arizona to Rhode Island. And from what I understand, there was a part of the journey where there was an F.B.I. agent who was assigned to her. And basically tailed her and shadowed her the whole time, which she remembers as being her great fortune because it meant that people weren't harassing her. For a Japanese American woman traveling alone across the country. And so she thinks of this F.B.I. agent as like a little guardian angel, in some ways, though she would not have used that phrase. But anyway, so she came to Pembroke and attended 14 Pembroke, and I believe she was the first Japanese American woman to attend Pembroke college. While she was here I believe there was maybe one other Japanese American student who I think was a man, who was a Brown student. I could be wrong about that, but I'm pretty sure she wasn't the first Japanese American at Brown, but I do think she was the first Japanese American woman.

And I know that at least on one occasion, I really upset some of the men. It was a course with John Berryman. He was a famous poet. And he was a visiting professor here. And I'd had a writing class with another professor. I'd gotten to skip freshman English. This was my freshman year. And I'd gone into the sort of next level of writing course, with another professor whose name I won't give. And he had, I suppose, the term would now be sexually harassed me. In other words, he made ... when I was in his office ... he made a very explicit, indecent proposal, and in fact, partially undressed himself. And I said, ""No, thank you, very much."" [31:00] And then I said, ""I do think it would be awkward for me to stay in your class, because how do I know that you would give me fair grades? You might give me bad grades because I didn't, or you might give me better grades because you're hoping I will, and you know, this would be terrible."" And Berryman's class was technically closed to freshmen. So I said, ""I want you to recommend me for Berryman's class."	"I certainly felt ... that it was up to us to demand the level of conversation that we wanted. I certainly never had any hesitation, as you can imagine, in speaking up. It may be because I'd gone to a girls' high school. That's, I think, the age when you're vulnerable to thinking you ought to pull your punches. But I never had to, because if I wanted ... I can't remember that I ever did ... but if I wanted to appear dumb in a social situation, I could do so without ever jeopardizing my academic interactions. 10 When we came here, we had a lot of seminars. And one of the reasons I concentrated in Spanish is because the classes were small. English, in those days, you had to take a lot of survey courses, which would be two centuries, and you read little [30:00] snippets of things, and I thought that was a terrible way to study.

So I said, ""I want you to recommend me for Berryman's class."" And then I visited Berryman's class, and it just happened that on that night, he was talking about the importance of first line. This was an expository writing class, not a poetry class. And so he said, ""What's the first line of Anna Karenina? And there was this sort of stellar pupil named Mike Samuels, who has since become a doctor and publish a book. And so he turned, ""Mr. Samuels."" We were always ""Mr. and Miss."" ""Mr. Samuels, what's the first line of Anna Karenina?"" Well, nobody knew. And it just so happened that I'd read Anna Karenina, and I remembered the first line. [32:00] And so then he said, ""Wonderful."" And then afterwards I went up, and I said, ""And can I be in your class?"" And he said, ""Yes, you know the first line of Anna Karenina, of course."" So I got to be in this class, and that was something that I thought was wonderful about Brown and Pembroke versus Harvard and Radcliffe, is you had the best professors your freshman year. I mean, we had the dean of the college teaching anthropology ... an introductory anthropology course. All of the best professors taught introductory courses. Very, very important part of (inaudible) what was going on (inaudible) So anyway, I was in that 11 class, and I wrote vaguely anti-male ... sort of male-bashing essays that were supposed to be humorous. And I know it infuriated Mr. Samuels in particular, and probably some of the other (inaudible) because word would get back to me. [33:00] How angry they were. But I never felt abashed.

The head of the department sexually harassed two professors, you know, professors in the department, a registrar and on and on it went.

But it was incredible. All the women who contribute to Our Bodies, Ourselves, all the people who over the last five or ten years have been 22 creating these wonderful new things. Sure, there was feminist health clinics, and women were writing on menstruation, and on menopause, and it was the beginning of writing about battered women, and it was coming out into the open, just beginning to come out into the open about how many women had experienced incest. And so there was all of this, and it was all in this one place. And, you know, Boston was really a hotbed.

But the person, one of the people associated with this, was also associated with a group of people at Chicago State. So, when this thing came up, all of this came back.

You know, you know when you're a student and you're late in the library, and you're coming home late and all of that--it was scary. And the people in my building harassed me quite a bit. So, it was... I was in a hurry to get out. And I took a lot of extra stuff and went through the summer. And I was on my way out of there at the end of the summer of 1966, with a master's degree. I wouldn't stay for the doctoral program, because I didn't like it. I hated it that much.	"Speaker 2: BU was okay. Boston, I hated it. It was not all that I expected. Out of all of that... all those places... all the universities and everything, I thought it was going to idyllic. Again, I liked the school. I had good professors at BU. But Boston itself was absolutely the most racist environment I had ever encountered. And I wasn't prepared for it. Because like people who had spent all of their lives in the South, we were expecting by the time we get in a place like that... some other kind of freedom that you never experienced, you know. Speaker 1: Boston is the home of the Kennedys. Speaker 2: Yeah, you think... all of those things, okay. And you don't think that you're going to end up with ""Nigger, go home"" signs pasted all over your door, and pictures of guns and rifles, and your neighbors telling you to go back where you came from, and all those things that happened to me when I was there. And because I was there virtually by myself, it was very frightening to me. Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you live in? Speaker 2: I lived in the Fenway area. I lived on a street called Hemingway across the street from Northeastern Illinois University. Because there was-- Speaker 1: In Massachusetts? Speaker 2: In Massachusetts. Did I say Northeastern Illinois? Speaker 1: You said Northeastern Illinois. Speaker 2: Northeastern University. Speaker 1: In Massachusetts? Speaker 2: In Mass... in Boston. It wasn't the BU neighborhood, but it was close enough. I could walk if I felt like a long walk, or I could take the streetcar and it wasn't very far. It was something that I could afford that was, I thought, near my school. No one told me that I was the first black person to live in the building. Because I had no trouble at all renting it, I didn't expect any problems. I looked at the place and I said, ""This is fine."" I filled out the application, gave them the money, they rented it to me. No warnings. So, it was a big shock to me to have that experience. There were other experiences that I had when I was there. And so it meant-- Speaker 1: What are some of the things that happened? Do you want to talk about them? Speaker 2: I was followed... lots of things. I had... my sister in Detroit [Michigan] had to send me mace, because it was against the law to have it in Boston.

My grandfather was his first born. He had eventually eight children. He founded the Montgomery Alabama Herald, his newspaper. And the story that has gone through the family, even before I heard it systematically from Aunt Esther was that he wrote an editorial against lynching. There was a woman, a white woman who frequented the slaves, well the black neighborhoods, and was going around with a black guy and somebody saw her there and she called rape and accused this man who she had been--had consensual relationship with and they lynched him. They dragged him through the street and lynched him, and he took exception to that and wrote an editorial about that. And they came to his house looking for him. He hid in the piano, they couldn't find him.	And one of the things that I did when I came to Chicago [Illinois] was to tape record my then 80-year-old aunt, my grandfather's sister [Esther], who was kind of the family historian. And sat down with her and taped her for about a week, and organized her pictures and that kind of thing. So she told the story in a very systematic way of our family. And one of the stories that had gone back through our family for years and years was how her father was run out of Montgomery, Alabama by a lynch mob. So we--she told it in a very organized way and as a result, I did some roots-type history and have traced back Jessie Chisholm Duke who is my great-grandfather. He was born in 1853, he was born to a slave woman and a father, I guess, 'cause he--his mother and father were Easter and Abner Duke, who were born around 1825, 1830. Easter was born of a slave woman and her master. So, and Esther says that this was the case so that our--we can basically trace back to about 1800, I guess, more or less, that side of the family. Easter and Abner Duke gave birth to three children, one of which was Jessie Chisolm Duke, who was born in 1853. He married Willie Evelyn Black, who was born in 1861, so both of them were born as slaves. Jessie Chisolm Duke was a--his mistress at one point, taught him how to read and write, so he learned how to read and write during slavery and worked that skill to his advantage. He was a mail clerk in Selma [Alabama], I guess during the time, let's see, during the Civil War. He was a teacher--I believe just after the Civil War, I'm sorry. He was a teacher and a mail clerk and at one point was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1884, I guess it was. Speaker 1: Was this in Alabama? Speaker 2: Well he was a national, this is national, but he was elected as an Alabama delegate. I think the convention was in Chicago [Illinois] actually. He came to Chicago to do that. Speaker 1: In 18--what was it? Speaker 2: It would have been 1884, I think. Story_ID: 85097 Speaker 1: And at that point he [Jessie Chisholm Duke] had married and had children.

He hid in the piano, they couldn't find him. Speaker 2: Hid in the piano? Speaker 1: In the piano. Apparently they had a piano that was big enough for him to hide in. So they couldn't find him and then the mayor of the town who was fairly friendly helped him escape in women's clothes and drove him to the train station.

So then, of our two senators, Paul Simon and Alan Dixon, Simon was very clear early, that he was going to oppose the Thomas nomination. Dixon equivocated and Dixon had a record of supporting certain Repub-, the President's nominations all during the Reagan years. But also, as a very conserve-, what we call a Reagan Democrat. I mean, he supported President Reagan more often that not on just about everything and yet had, you know, obviously maintained his position as senator for the whole state of Illinois. And I just thought that it was an error for him to support Thomas's nomination. So then there was one other television program that I did, and this one was with Susan Getzendanner, and Susan and I were now talking about the Thomas nomination. And following that, there was some beginning talk about if Dixon won't commit, you know, maybe we're going to have to run someone against him or threaten him or at least scare him a little bit. Lo and behold, Alan Dixon voted to confirm Clarence Thomas, even though the women in Illinois had been, you know, really anxious that he not do so and calling him right at his office. I'm skipping ahead actually because before that happened, the Thomas nomination happened in two parts. The first part was just on Clarence Thomas and on his record at the EEOC. And then there was a recess in the proceedings that went on for about two weeks. And, it was during that period that the Anita Hill revelations became known. And so then we had this whole period which Anita Hill was on television and the Senate hearings were being televised. People were looking at the Senate for the first time and not seeing anybody that looked like them, paying attention to the process, and the proceedings, and to the power that these guys had. Story_ID: 16731 Speaker 1: During that period, some people had started to say well you know, maybe you could think about just giving [Alan] Dixon a scare and saying you're gonna run against him if he votes for Clarence Thomas. I didn't, frankly, at that point, really take it all that seriously. It was just the thought that was kind of protest politics at that point. And then as Anita Hill's testimony went on, the women, as you know, became more and more enraged really about not just what had happened to her, not just the sexual harassment that she had experienced, but the fact that the members of the committee just didn't seem to get it that this was a major economic issue for women. And at the time, I remember having conversation after conversation that most professional women who have worked in the workplace had had some incident of sexual harassment. Everybody had a story of, you know, the boss who, you know, touched their breasts or their back or their legs or something, or who, you know, asked them out for dates or whatever. So this was something that resonated with women across the board. And the fact that there were no women in the Senate. Well, there were two at the time: we had Nancy Kassebaum on the Republican side, Barbara Mikulski on the Democratic side and that was really it. And so the fact that the Senate was 98 percent rich, white, and male, and that there was nobody reflecting the rest of America there who could even explain it to them, what was going on, really infuriated a lot of people. When the vote came, in spite of all the opportunities from the women in my state, Dixon voted to confirm Clarence Thomas. And it happened in kind of almost serendipity, again--. It happened that he did so on a Thursday, I think the vote was on a Thursday evening, we're checking this, either Thursday or Friday. But whatever happened, his office was closed for the next two days because of the hot weekend, and then there was the Columbus Day holiday. So he went either three or four days--I think it was either three or four days, it could have even been five, I think four is right--in which his phones weren't being answered at all. And you had women from all over Illinois calling to protest and their phone calls were not getting answered at all. So that just poured salt in the wound and exasperated the anger at the vote that he had made. And so at that point, I was still recorder of deeds and I got a	job you did on the Callaway show, da-da, da-da, we think it's terrific.

Speaker 1: I never really heard of, about it.

Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure. I mean I don't know about my girlfriends themselves, but I have a girlfriend, one of my girlfriends from Flint [Michigan] whose daughter was molested for years by my girlfriend's husband, for years and she's now in her early forties and she's just getting over it and she's now you know trying to work with you know other young women that have gone through that.

Speaker 2: Sure, there was a priest at St. Matthew's [St. Matthew Catholic Church, Flint, Michigan], his name was Father O'Grady [ph.]. He was--not only, he was, he was a horrible man. He was an alcoholic; at that time the church which was almost like a small cathedral, they had installed a mic [microphone] system because you couldn't hear the Mass if you were in the back of the church, and when he would receive the Blood of Christ (laughter), the altar boy would, would tip you know the little cup. I think they used to drink Mogen David wine, I don't know, and he'd, you know, pour the, the wine into the chalice and the priest would always--Father O'Grady would always hit the pitcher so that the altar boy would pour more wine in, and then he would drink it and I, I don't know why nobody ever told him that when you drink and if you, if you sigh, we're gonna hear it all over the church. He would drink that wine down and he'd go (makes sound). (Laughter) Oh lord and when he would get the, you know receive the, you know, Blood of Christ before he would give out the, the first communion, same thing, (makes sound). But I saw him on at least three occasions feeling up the novice nuns, going up under--they had these long white bibs that they wore that was part of their habit, going up under there and feeling their breasts and just having them pinned up against the wall in between the, the convent and the church rectory and there was this narrow little wall-way, hallway or walkway rather, and I saw him do this like three times and then I was told by someone that there were a lot of, of abortions, I mean a lot of aborted bodies that were buried on the grounds of the convent. Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw, (unclear) say that about (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then there, you know we would have the strange disappearances of some young nun, she'd be in school one day and then I mean and then she wouldn't be at, at the school anymore, and you wouldn't see her at the convent anymore and I suspected those were the ones that were getting pregnant.	"Speaker 2: Uh-huh, but I had, I had an incident when I did my confession with the priest. I don't remember what church I went to, if it was St. Matthew's [St. Matthew Catholic Church, Flint, Michigan] or if it was St. Michael's [St. Michael Catholic Church, Flint, Michigan]--oh, it was a church, it was a Catholic church in East Lansing [Michigan], because I was at Michigan State [Michigan State University] at the time, and he wanted me to give him details. I said, ""You know I have kissed and I've, I've been fondled up--,"" you know, because we've been told that we have to confess everything and you know of course, I had not had full blown sex, but you know I'd done everything almost, but you know and so when I was, I was saying that he said, ""Well, like wow, how many times did you kiss?"" I was like, ""I don't know, father."" ""Did he touch you?"" ""Oh, yes father."" ""Did he touch your breasts?"" ""Oh, yes father."" You know, ""Well how many times?"" And I started like hearing him like breath heavy and so then he asked me to, to wait for him after he finished the, you know, the confessions and then he wanted to talk to me, and I remember sitting outside, it was like in the spring. I remember sitting outside of this church on a bench and this priest coming out and I noticed he was like really sweaty and he took my hand and he was like, ""My child,"" you know. I don't know what he said but his hands were all clammy and I was like, I mean I'm like, dude, but I was like, ""Sorry, father."" He says, you know, ""I need to have some one on one time with you to help you to cleanse yourself."" And I was like, I've been down that road. I was molested from like the age of twelve, I was molested like, four times. I was raped twice. So, I'd already--so I knew that one. I knew that story (laughter). So, I was like, ""Oh, no, I'm not going."" Speaker 1: This by, by a Catholic priest? Speaker 2: It was a Catholic priest. Wanted to give me some one on one sessions. So, thank--well, you know thank goodness, I'd had other incidents in that regard that I knew, but when he grabbed my hand with my hand it was oh so clammy, he was breathing hard. I don't know if I'd given him an erection or not, but I knew it was wrong. Story_ID: 659977 Speaker 1: You wanna tell that story? Speaker 2: Sure, there was a priest at St. Matthew's [St. Matthew Catholic Church, Flint, Michigan], his name was Father O'Grady [ph.]. He was--not only, he was, he was a horrible man. He was an alcoholic; at that time the church which was almost like a small cathedral, they had installed a mic [microphone] system because you couldn't hear the Mass if you were in the back of the church, and when he would receive the Blood of Christ (laughter), the altar boy would, would tip you know the little cup. I think they used to drink Mogen David wine, I don't know, and he'd, you know, pour the, the wine into the chalice and the priest would always--Father O'Grady would always hit the pitcher so that the altar boy would pour more wine in, and then he would drink it and I, I don't know why nobody ever told him that when you drink and if you, if you sigh, we're gonna hear it all over the church. He would drink that wine down and he'd go (makes sound). (Laughter) Oh lord and when he would get the, you know receive the, you know, Blood of Christ before he would give out the, the first communion, same thing, (makes sound). But I saw him on at least three occasions feeling up the novice nuns, going up under--they had these long white bibs that they wore that was part of their habit, going up under there and feeling their breasts and just having them pinned up against the wall in between the, the convent and the church rectory and there was this narrow little wall-way, hallway or walkway rather, and I saw him do this like three times and then I was told by someone that there were a lot of, of abortions, I mean a lot of aborted bodies that were buried on the grounds of the convent. Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw, (unclear) say that about (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then there, you know we would have the strange disappearances of some young nun, she'd be in school one day and then I mean and then she wouldn't be at, at the school anymore, and you wouldn't see her at the convent anymore and I suspected those were the ones that were getting pregnant. Speaker 1: Did you see anything comparable in the public school [Southwestern High School; Southwestern Classical Academy, Flint, Michigan], with teachers and students or as teachers and other teachers (unclear)? Speaker 2: I had a--I had my science teacher really, really like me and he would always allow me to come and work on my, my science projects and he would get close to me but I--like I said, I'd had all these incidents happen to me so I knew how to move away. I mean I was molested by my [paternal] step-grandfather when I was eleven in front of my sister [Rhonda Garrett Whiters]. Can you believe that? But I did have--no, but at the public school, that was the only incident that I knew about and I don't--no one ever mentioned having any issues, but I'm talking about the black children. So, I don't know what happened with the white kids. Speaker 1: So, you had, you had quite a few things that happened to you that weren't really supposed to happen to a girl your age? Speaker 2: Yep. Speaker 1: Before you-- Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: So. Speaker 2: Often. Speaker 1: Hm. Speaker 2: You know I was quite well endowed by the time I was twelve. I wore, up until I was fifty, you will not see me in anything that fit because of all those problems and then when I turned fifty I felt like I could control, I knew I could control my situations and I wanted to, everybody was getting breast augmentations and here I had these natural things and so I said, ""Oh, I'm--shoot everybody else is doing it,"" and that was when I first started wearing clothes that fit. I would never wear a dress like this before in my forties (makes sound), everything was loose, everything was loose and that, it's because of that.

That would probably be the earliest memory, and the mayonnaise sandwiches. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, we always ask this question. Now, so did you grow up near Livingston you were saying? Speaker 2: I did, when we were young, I grew up at Fairwood and Livingston. I went, Fairwood Elementary [Fairwood Elementary School; Fairwood Alternative Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] is where I went to kindergarten, and we had an apartment there. And that's probably where I spent--until I was nine years old that was the community we lived in. And then, when my mother married John Porter [ph.], we moved up to the Brittany Hills area [Columbus, Ohio], where Ohio Dominican College [Ohio Dominican University] is. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, now is that a move up in the neighborhood or? Speaker 2: It was, we got a house. John, she married John, and he bought a house so, you know, it was probably about a thousand square foot house and three bedrooms, no air conditioning, but it was a house. We had a basement. We had a backyard. We really thought we were moving up. I actually thought we were middle class until I got to college [Ohio University, Athens, Ohio], and they told me I was underprivileged so (laughter). But, you know, I, I want to go back to that. I don't want that childhood memory to be at that pedophile. I should think of something happy of a childhood memory 'cause that's a bad one, but it's odd-- Speaker 1: (Unclear) earlier than that? I	And as we walked behind the alley, and now this--I'm a sheltered kid, didn't go out much, was always an introvert--and I remember this old drunk man exposing himself to us, and being terrified.

I'd actually never thought about it before now, how much attention I give to kids and abuse issues.

Speaker 2: Oh, sure. I mean, I, I dealt with any number of cases. We dealt with, not only divorces and dissolutions because we were a combined family court, but my toughest cases were dealing with bind over cases, you know, decisions where you had to, you had to make a decision about whether you help a juvenile in juvenile court or transfer them to adult court. Dealing with children who were raped by their parent's boyfriends or live-ins, some of the horrific abuse that I saw happened to kids. It, it was, it was a challenging court to be on. You can't even begin to imagine what people do, or will allow to be done to their children. It, it was shocking for me. And so, one of the things that I did, as I said to my staff, I said, ""You know, look, we know we have six years. I don't know if they're going to give me more than that, but we know we have six."" And the one thing I know about black robes is when you put them on, suddenly, the media cares what you have to say. And so, I made it very intentional to talk about abused children and how the system was treating them and pushing for improvement in how we dealt with these cases. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, we live in a time of increasing public scrutiny of certain kinds of crimes of that nature. Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: People abused, 'Oprah Winfrey Show' ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'], or these talk shows-- Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: --talk about these, but you're seeing things at another level. Speaker 2: Oh-- Speaker 1: You're seeing people actually walk in-- Speaker 2: Absolutely. Speaker 1: --on a level of intensity and we, we can't imagine. Speaker 2: I had, I will never forget this. I had a twelve year old who was pregnant by her mother's boyfriend. And the mother kept trying to convince me that he didn't do it. And I said, I finally looked at her, and I said, ""Ma'am, we have the DNA. You can try to get your daughter to recant all you want to. That is his baby."" And she looked at me, and she said, ""Why do you keep babying her about this? She can get over it. I got over it, she can get over it."" This is this child's mother, and she forced this twelve year old--and I'm not saying it was the wrong decision, but she did it out of her own
motives. She never asked the child if she wanted to keep her baby. She told her she was giving it up for adoption. She said, ""Because I have a baby by this guy, and it's going to be too weird. What, I'm raising my grandbaby who's a sibling to my son? That's not going to happen."" So, this twelve year old, tears streaming down her face, not even understanding what's happening to her. She had depression, she was raped by her mother's boyfriend. And her mother, instead of trying to help her own daughter get through it, was there trying to get her daughter to say something that would allow the boyfriend not to go to prison. It, it and then, there were so many examples of that. I can't even begin to tell you. Speaker 1: Yeah, that's unfathomable, you know. You'd think she--what would he have to do for her if they want to get rid of him? I mean, I don't know, I think, you would think that'd be enough, right? Speaker 2: What, for the girl--oh, yeah, for the boyfriend (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) yeah (unclear). Speaker 2: Yeah. I think, you know-- Speaker 1: What could he do? Speaker 2: There are so many women who are so insecure that they would have rather settled for any piece of man than to be by themselves. You know, the one thing I learned growing up with my mother [Sylvia Banks Kendrick] is she said, ""There's a difference between being alone and being lonely."" She said, ""Now, if I'm going to struggle, I'd rather struggle by myself,"" you know. And so many women would just rather say they have a man, even if it's somebody that abuses their kids or mistreats them. It's a phenomenon I still can't ever get used to."

And Nationwide Children's, one of my friends was on the board and Nationwide Children's asked me to come and talk to them. And they wanted to create a one stop child abuse center because they had children who were sexually abused, spending hours in the emergency room, sometimes eight, ten, twelve hours waiting on detectives to get there, waiting on children's services to get there. So, they basically said, ""This is kind of what we're thinking, but we'd like you with your experience to come in and design it."" And so, I literally got the opportunity to plan, program, and build a center from the ground up. They had originally told me I had $3 million. I, I ultimately got $10 million, and we built a forty-two 
housand square foot facility that, now in Franklin County [Ohio], we've been open now for, since 2005 for seven years. So, we have literally changed the paradigm on how you treat abused children. What we did is we moved all of the systems that deal with seriously abused children into one location. This beautiful building looks like you're walking into somebody's living room. It doesn't look like a hospital. It doesn't look institutional. We moved our five child abuse physicians, nurse practitioners, eight trauma treatment therapists, seventeen detectives from our special victims bureau at the Columbus police department [Columbus Division of Police], ten children services investigators, two Franklin County prosecutors, a domestic violence therapist, a child psychiatrist, and the Columbus Coalition Against Family Violence [The Center for Family Safety and Healing, Columbus, Ohio] all in one location, all working together. It took us two years just to get the memorandums of understanding completed. But what--it's amazing what happens when you take six organizations that are used to pointing the finger at each other, which is what they used to do when I was on the bench; the police would blame children's services. Children's services would blame the prosecutor as to why nothing happened. But now, instead of being this anonymous name on a phone message, it's the person you see in the parking lot. It's the person you get coffee with in the morning. So, the beauty of this is that when a child is raped, they come to the center, and everybody they need to see is at the center: the detective's there, the children's services worker is here, the physician is there. We immediately get them into trauma treatment with a therapist. And so, oftentimes, the police detective is able to go and interview the alleged perpetrator before the mom can get home and say, oh, my god, this is what they found. So, it's a wonderful system. It was the work of my life. It's what I thought I was going to end my career doing. And then, Governor Strickland [Ted Strickland] called in 2010 (laughter). Speaker 1: Yeah. For the record, the name of the place is the Center for Child and Family Advocacy [The Center for Family Safety and Healing, Columbus, Ohio]-- Speaker 2: At Nationwide Children's-- Speaker 1: --at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: And this makes so much sense. Is this still going on? Speaker 2: It is. Speaker 1: And has it been replicated in others? Speaker 2: Yeah, we, and we actually weren't the first people to come up with this concept. I mean, there are centers like this that exist. Chicago [Illinois] has one. I went to visit the Chicago one. It's twenty-seven thousand square feet. That's when I knew I had to make it bigger. And Chicago's is a house, it's really kind of whimsical. They have windows that are on the floor, and they have windows that go up outside down, so it's really entertaining for a child to look at. But one of the things I--when I met with the director there, and I asked her, I said, ""What would you do if you were doing different--doing it today differently?"" She said, ""I'd build it bigger."" Because what we, what we everybody underestimated, which we got the benefit of their experience, is that when you create a safe place for people to come, where they don't have to go down to the police station, where they don't have to into a hospital emergency room, it makes it easier for people to come forward. So, I went to San Diego [California], I went to Chicago, I sent a consultant to Denver [Colorado], I went to Cincinnati [Ohio]. I went to Houston [Texas]. Houston has a fifty-six thousand square foot facility, and they were adding on to it at the time I visited them in 2002. So, we didn't create the model. I'd like to say that ours is the most comprehensive model because we included domestic violence because what we found in interviewing our families is that 60 percent of our parents gave a current or prior history of domestic violence, so we believed in terms of healing the child, we had to heal the family.

(Pause) My earliest childhood--never really thought about that before. I think, the thing I remember probably most vividly as a child, I had this, I loved to read. It's hard for people to realize that I was a painfully shy kid growing up. I wore--I had the cat eye glasses. And I was a little chubby kid, so I would always read. And I can remember at our house, we lived in, early on, when I was about five or six, we lived on this--it was like a house, but the, there were two apartments, and we lived on the upstairs apartment. And my mother [Sylvia Banks Kendrick] used to fix us mayonnaise sandwiches. We never, never knew meat was supposed to go in them, right? You put mayonnaise on the bread, little bit of sugar, and that was your sandwich (laughter). And so I would always sit and read, even at five or six years old. I just loved it. I, I didn't go outside like the normal kids. And one time, a friend of mine, some kid in the neighborhood, we were walking to the carry out, Dimler's carry out [ph.] at Fairwood [Avenue] and--Fairwood and Livingston [Avenue]. And as we walked behind the alley, and now this--I'm a sheltered kid, didn't go out much, was always an introvert--and I remember this old drunk man exposing himself to us, and being terrified.

Well you know in some ways Derek Bell's wife, whose first name I'm not remembering and Doris, whose name I'm not remembering who was in the admissions office at Radcliffe [College, now merged with Harvard University], were probably more of a personal influence. I mean, I think that Martin Kilson had a much bigger impact on the boys than on the young women. And it was interesting. I took his course and--the Political Science course, and he--he had all of us write about politics in our home town. So I went--I went back home [Indianapolis, Indiana], I guess over Christmas break, and I interviewed a lot of the older black politicians and, you know, wrote my paper for him. And that was a very smart thing for him because he was looking at black agency and power in cities all over the country. But he really was much more of a mentor to the young men and I hear them even now talk about their conversations with him. But, you know, he was a little--he was a little bit problematic for the girls. And you know later he had this sexual harassment suit and there were some of my, you know, some of my friends who were a little bit traumatized by him.

But there was one year that there had been a rape that was very highly publicized and, and Ersa not only knew the young woman who had been raped but had taken her under her wing.

I had one classmate--one classmate from New York; I got a Jewish classmate who asked me, ""Bette, why would a girl like you want to go to medical school?"" I said, ""Well, you know, I want to be a doctor, and the only way I can be a doctor is to go to medical school."" And he says, ""Oh--oh."" So that, that, that, that sums--that generally sums it up."

They just couldn't be together. That twisted into something else when I found out that my birth father was white and a whole realm of possibilities that I hadn't considered came into view for me.

When I found out he was white I thought about those things. What I didn't think was that they could have just been in love so that speaks to my own upbringing I guess. But as it turns out you know when I met Cookie [Clarke's biological mother, Carole Cole], I think she, she, she was in love. She had a huge crush on Stanley Goldberg.

Ron Brown was one month older than me. But I seemed too young. There were you know, things said and things done that I addressed even to the point of telling one individual that I was going to hurt him because of his aggressiveness. And he didn't believe me but I made it real clear. I said to him, I said, ""How will you explain to the folks downstairs how you got all those scratches on your face? 'Cause I will hurt you."" You know, sometimes I could be more bravado than there really is. But I was serious. But the point is that that happens. And some women can handle it and some can't. I didn't need a lawsuit. I didn't need a newspaper story. I just needed this turkey to get it straight. That he was not gonna hurt me. 'Cause I was gonna hurt him. But the sexism in the Urban League was rampant. When I was in the Washington Bureau [starting in 1991] one of the things that I did start talking about to our execs was sex harassment. And what that meant, and what that could mean to them. They used to make jokes. ""How you know how that feels? How do you describe sexism?"" I said, ""I--let's put it this way. If that person next to you had done that or said that to your mother, how would you have felt? If it was wrong for your mother, then it's wrong. If you can't accept the explanation, put your mother, your wife or your daughter in the category. And if they--you would be offended if this happened to them, then it's wrong."" And then it was shortly after that, we had a male exec sued. Several male execs were sued subsequently. But right after that conversation. And then we had a female exec sued. And I began to talk about the fact that, ""Ladies it's coming to you too."" And you know, they were sitting back there so few in numbers, they didn't believe this. But one of our female execs was sued for a sex harassment. And unfortunately I would say to them that, ""You know, it's not what you're doing, but it looks like you're doing."" And she would always take these nice young looking guys out for a drink after work. She thought that was nice. That was fun. ""Don't do that lady. You've got to be careful. Don't do that man. You've got to be careful."" We had one person, his story hit the newspapers right after that. He was dating some woman on staff. And he didn't show the night before because the wife had priority. And the woman had fixed his favorite food, which was spaghetti. She came the next morning with a pot of spaghetti and dumped it on his head. And that was the beginning. 'Cause everybody called the press. The people that he was mad at on the staff, they called the press and told it. But, you know, some of these guys didn't get it for a long time. But now I think they got it. I think they know, even though some one will--some will push the envelope, they know that this applies to them to.

I came out at the end of the party, and I walked up to [David] Fanning, and I said, ""I've just read the most incredible story ever. You've gotta read--(laughter)--you've gotta see this"", you know. So I decided I was gonna try to do--I called Leon, and I said, do you think that Rosa Lee would be willing to take part in a documentary. So she did. She was, and I did. And Rosa Lee actually--if I had not done the story of Rosa Lee, I could not have done ""Secret Daughter"" 'cause I learned so much about--well, part of it was the craft of reporting from Leon, but the other part of it was Rosa Lee as a human being, having done--even though she was a despicable person. I mean she had prostituted her own daughter. She was a drug addict who had three of her own children who were also heroin addict. She was literally--she also was living with HIV. I think she was like the third, third person (laughter) I'd done a story with who was literally--she had AIDS. She was heroin addicted. She was going for her methadone every day. And she was the kindest, most giving grandmother that I had ever seen. I remember she had a--she wanted me to do a story at that point, she kept pushing me to do a story about how the teenage girls, because of all these blended families, women hooking up with different men, that every often, they would bring male children with them into the households, and then there was a sexual abuse of young girls going on, if there were female children in these households because they weren't supervised properly. And she kept pushing me to do this story, pushing me to do the story, and I was like, Rosa Lee, I can't do the story. And then she introduced me to her, to a granddaughter of hers, to whom this had happened, and this granddaughter had a baby.

Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I called Percy Sutton to simply just ask him could I join and go down with the group, but he said, ""No we don't want any coverage you know, you don't need to go."" So, I went of course. So, it was so ugly. It was so--the minute I got to this diner. It was a diner, this diner refused to serve blacks, so three men were behind the counter. ""Y'all can't sit here, we don't serve niggers."" So, it, it, it's, it's still shakes you up. You, you hear about it, you read about, but every time it happens it shakes you up again and say I can't believe what I'm hearing. I can't believe this is now, this is today. I can't believe this kind of hatred exists. All of this goes through your mind, but here it is these terrible people. They knew in advance, of course, that the, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] leaders are coming down there. They didn't know a female reporter was going to be there, so I'm sitting there and I'm really frightened 'cause I'm seeing maybe for the first time the worse kind of hatred and anger and, and possible killing. I'm seeing this vividly, vividly, just by the language, the way they insulted, the things they said and how they said, the men behind the counter of the diner, which was--to these NAACP leaders, who were trying to be served. They, of course, the leaders all anticipated this. This was all done on purpose. They wanted to be arrested. They indicated a little surprise at me being there. They--I was not known as an NAACP leader and it soon, and they soon realized that I was a reporter and so they said awful dirty things to me very loudly.

Except when they came to arrest everybody, one of the policeman reminded another policeman that the law, I believe, he said says that when a woman is arrested she must be arrested by a woman cop, which may or may not be true. I'm inclined to believe it is, it was true because what advantage would it be for leaving me there. But, they arrested the men and I was left there with these terrible men behind the counter. I think there were five of them shouting insults to me that I cannot even repeat. I, I've never been that frightened in my life. I, I was, and, and I'm wondering if they're gonna rape me, 'cause that was suggested as part of the insults they were throwing at me. I said are these four men gonna rape me? Are they gonna kill me, or is, is this woman police person whose gonna arrest me is she really gonna come? And I prayed quietly. I didn't, I, I just prayed quietly, and, and was so frightened wondering could I withstand what I thought was gonna happen to me, could I try to kill myself. It, it was not anger that I had it was just plain fear, just plain fear, the worse kind of fear. Story_ID: 372504 Speaker 1: The woman cop came sooner than I had expected, thank God.

One night, I don't know the time but one night I heard all this noise out and I looked out the window and saw nothing but lamp, I mean, torches now I didn't see this but my mother and daddy talked about it later, they talked about it later after I had gotten into college and grown. When I tried--before I would ask what was this and they would not, never tell you because one thing they didn't want you to be afraid--those were some strong people. I was in college when I found out about this. That night, what had happen there was a black boy they were looking for--claimed to have molested a white girl and they came to the community. Now I'm talking about fifty or sixty Klansman and they had torches and they came knocking on doors and my daddy happened to go to the door in his pajamas or whatever he slept in. They brought him out on the porch and they surrounded him and they--men with shotguns and these torches asking him questions. They had him with his foot out looking at the bottom of his feet to see if he had been out. My mother went out there, stood in front of him and started screaming and yelling why are you doing this, who is this, what is this, my husband has been here with us, you are frightening me and my children, what is this and she would carry on boy. They finally said no let's leave him alone. I remember seeing those lights; I remember the noise, as I said vaguely. For years I asked my mother and daddy who was that, what was going on because I didn't know but they would never tell me until I got grown. My brother didn't even wake up.

Now I'm talking about fifty or sixty Klansman and they had torches and they came knocking on doors and my daddy happened to go to the door in his pajamas or whatever he slept in. They brought him out on the porch and they surrounded him and they--men with shotguns and these torches asking him questions. They had him with his foot out looking at the bottom of his feet to see if he had been out. My mother went out there, stood in front of him and started screaming and yelling why are you doing this, who is this, what is this, my husband has been here with us, you are frightening me and my children, what is this and she would carry on boy. They finally said no let's leave him alone. I remember seeing those lights; I remember the noise, as I said vaguely. For years I asked my mother and daddy who was that, what was going on because I didn't know but they would never tell me until I got grown. My brother didn't even wake up. But they, that kind of thing they just never talked about. Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing you should never forget either. Speaker 2: Oh you don't. Believe it or not, really believe this or not when I started--when I get sick or something in the back of my mind I can just see that, I can see the lights. Do you understand what I mean? It still made that much of an impression on me.

And apparently, the Dixiecrats were running for office and so, immediately I got hit by this, you know, overwhelming white political power structure. Some blacks had started, I think, probably in the early 1950s running for office, but it was just a thing that people did with no hopes of winning. I think Dr. [Joseph E.] Walker had run for the school board and maybe somebody had run for public office of some kind and what not. But there, we became, my husband [HM Russell Sugarmon, Jr.] and I became very involved in the political campaign and then also in the struggle for civil rights. Immediately, we joined the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], starting going to meetings, the NAACP was being overhauled, it had very old non-progressive leadership. At the time we got to Memphis, which was 1956 a lot of northern educated young professional blacks were coming back to Memphis. There was Jesse Turner, who was the banker, who came from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]. There was A. W. Willis who came from Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan]. There was Russell Sugarmon, my husband who was from Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. There was me from Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts]. There was [HM] Maxine Smith who'd gotten a Master's at Middlebury [College, Middlebury, Vermont]. Suddenly, there was Vasco Smith, who had gotten his doctor, D. D. degree. So, there were doctors and lawyers and people who, we were supported by the black community, you know; any time you have dentists, and doctors, teachers, nurses, whatever. Our financial support came from the black community, so we felt like we could afford to step out there, we ain't had no money, but we had lots of umpf, lots of energy and we got involved in politics. Immediately, let's see, Maxine and I had our babies. The next summer she and I applied to Memphis State University [later, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee], which had no, this is, this is 19--, let me see, I went there in 1956; this is 1957. The Supreme Court decision was 1954 [Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954)], this is three years later. She and I applied, oh it created a furor, ahh the people were really upset. Finally, they decided we were not qualified, (laughter) in spite of the fact that I finished Wellesley, she had a Master's, she said, ""I didn't even want to go there."" It was just something that, you know, we had to do; so we were unqualified. In the meantime I was getting nightly calls from people who said they were on the football team and if I came out there, they were come and rape me. My husband and I lived on Lenow Alley [sic, Place, Memphis, Tennessee]. His parents lived on Walker [Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee] right across from the college [LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee] and his father, bless his sweet soul, built us a little one bedroom, tiny little house on their back property, which faced onto the alley. So, one night we woke up and there was a gunshot through the window, people fired onto the thing. So, we were not afraid for ourselves, but we sent our kids, I sent-'cause I had two babies at the time and we sent them, the little girl up to Saint Louis to stay with his sister for a good part of the summer cause we were afraid for the children. So, you know, there were threats and what not. But we kept on, we were completely fearless. Then, in 1959 Russell ran for the County Commission [Shelby County Board of Commissioners], and all of us were really active; I mean door-to-door, campaigning, up late at night, up early in the morning, speaking in churches, rallying, just, we really just became caught up. Now, in that race we really did think blacks had a chance to win. Unfortunately, he was defeated and the other two, one of them was [HM Benjamin] Benny Hooks, one of them was a minister, Reverend [Roy] Love and so the three of them were defeated. But, we were not discouraged, we were determined and I think people realized at that point that there was this movement which was now manifesting itself in different ways.

Can I go back to 1969? A really pivotal moment in my life, I call it (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-nine [1969]? Okay. Speaker 2: Yeah. One of my best girlfriends went away to school and we had known each other since I was twelve years old. She went to Southern Illinois--Southern Louisiana University [sic. Southern University at Shreveport] in Shreveport, Louisiana. And so I took my second flight ever in my life down to Shreveport, Louisiana. And there--now I've gone through some black experiences, [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis is my icon. I go down to the South in the '60s [1960s] with an Afro, short pants, tight t-shirt with the peace sign, in a place that still---where people if you were black, had to dress up with some form of docili- being docile and with servility if you were going downtown. You had to be in your Sunday dress. But I didn't do that. In going to the stores, women would tell me, the white women would say, you know, ""Baby, you aren't from here, are you?"" Because I wasn't saying, ""Yes ma'am."" I wasn't giving them the proper southern props. And my best friend's grandmother lived way in the country. And she lived in the outback with the outhouse. And I decided one day being the adventurous Marcia [HistoryMaker Reverend Marcia Dyson], to take a bike ride on the country road. And on that country road looking at the trees and glistening, I went and stopped at a little country store, just like out of Spanky [George ""Spanky"" McFarland] and 'Our Gang,' the ragged screen fence, the little store and the eggs on ice and a little boy, black boy with a striped t-shirt was buying six eggs. Not even in a crate, just had six eggs, holding them and put them on the counter. And was looking in his pocket and threw the money on--put the money--was gonna put the money on the counter. And I told the little boy, ""Boy if you giving the man your money, you can look the man in his eyes."" And the little boy looked at me kind of head cocked like I was crazy. He threw that money on the counter, grabbed those eggs, put them whatever cloth, maybe his mother--and ran out the store. And again, this man in the store said like, ""Girl, you must not be from here."" I was like, ""No, I'm not from here, I'm from Chicago [Illinois]."" Now forget Emmett Till, forget--and I'm this big, black girl with the black experiences. I have seen some things, I have seen Fred Hampton killed. I know about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and all this shuffling Negroes. This is not me, I'm this tough girl from the North. I am from Chicago. But I started riding that bike back home, back, bike back to her, her grandmother's house. And on the way there, a car full of rednecks came behind me. Then they were beside me. And they were saying things to me that when I saw that sun glistening on the trees, I thought my mother [Rosa Fields Smith] would never see me again because they were gonna take me into those woods and I'm sure rape me. A school bus came with white children. And I pedaled that bus [sic.] to keep up with the school bus and cross that bus in front of it perilously, rather be hit than be snatched in the woods by those white men. And the fear of every black person that I had seen in the movies, that trepidation, that southern fear, took hold of me and let me realize that like they said about Malcolm X compared to Martin Luther King, I saw the South on a soapbox, they saw it from the struggle. And it was my comeuppance. I started respecting the struggle more, the southern experience more. I understood the fear because it was in me. And it humbled me, you know, a great deal. I just thought that was, that was a very marker in my life as well, you know, of humbling."	"We were there for three years. But that remind me of something. Can I go back to 1969? A really pivotal moment in my life, I call it (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-nine [1969]? Okay. Speaker 2: Yeah. One of my best girlfriends went away to school and we had known each other since I was twelve years old. She went to Southern Illinois--Southern Louisiana University [sic. Southern University at Shreveport] in Shreveport, Louisiana. And so I took my second flight ever in my life down to Shreveport, Louisiana. And there--now I've gone through some black experiences, [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis is my icon. I go down to the South in the '60s [1960s] with an Afro, short pants, tight t-shirt with the peace sign, in a place that still---where people if you were black, had to dress up with some form of docili- being docile and with servility if you were going downtown. You had to be in your Sunday dress. But I didn't do that. In going to the stores, women would tell me, the white women would say, you know, ""Baby, you aren't from here, are you?"" Because I wasn't saying, ""Yes ma'am."" I wasn't giving them the proper southern props. And my best friend's grandmother lived way in the country. And she lived in the outback with the outhouse. And I decided one day being the adventurous Marcia [HistoryMaker Reverend Marcia Dyson], to take a bike ride on the country road. And on that country road looking at the trees and glistening, I went and stopped at a little country store, just like out of Spanky [George ""Spanky"" McFarland] and 'Our Gang,' the ragged screen fence, the little store and the eggs on ice and a little boy, black boy with a striped t-shirt was buying six eggs. Not even in a crate, just had six eggs, holding them and put them on the counter. And was looking in his pocket and threw the money on--put the money--was gonna put the money on the counter. And I told the little boy, ""Boy if you giving the man your money, you can look the man in his eyes."" And the little boy looked at me kind of head cocked like I was crazy. He threw that money on the counter, grabbed those eggs, put them whatever cloth, maybe his mother--and ran out the store. And again, this man in the store said like, ""Girl, you must not be from here."" I was like, ""No, I'm not from here, I'm from Chicago [Illinois]."" Now forget Emmett Till, forget--and I'm this big, black girl with the black experiences. I have seen some things, I have seen Fred Hampton killed. I know about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and all this shuffling Negroes. This is not me, I'm this tough girl from the North. I am from Chicago.

For example that would say, you know, you've gotta have prevention of sexual harassment training annually and so making sure that we do that. Now where I would add my spin is making sure we do it in a way that people can actually learn it and understand and that it's not a check a box, but it's something that actually learn from or take away from.

And, that was-- Speaker 2: He was on from the beginning and he was there to keep the show from being politically incorrect, keep it accurate, make sure that we weren't sending irresponsible messages unwittingly. And, so, he would read every script and then give his notes. Now, obviously, political correctness can be the enemy of comedy (laughter). Especially, psychological political correctness because, you know, he's super sensitive to this might offend women. Or, this might be perceived as too aggressive, and it was sort of like, the human beings behave badly sometimes or not perfectly. And, so, there was a little tug of war sometimes (simultaneous). Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. Because I can't imagine the writers being too happy. Speaker 2: No. They were not happy. They were not happy. I was like, ""Oh, my god, here come the Alvin Poussaint notes."" But, he's actually a very lovely man, and I do think it's wonderful to have that conscience as annoying as it could be. And, on 'A Different World' we had even bigger problems because 'The Cosby Show' was very, very clean. But, you know, we--'A Different World' it was a college campus.

I think that the women preachers, the woman preacher, has brought to the forefront some issues that were pushed to the back in our writing, in our preaching, in our programming. I just had a women's conference over in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. And I talked about--you know, we had classes on things like childlessness, raising children, overcoming divorce, getting rid of the anger, getting rid of the bitterness.

We've not been afraid to talk about it, and we've not been afraid to deal with it, to help women to express themselves and hear what they need to hear in order to overcome divorce, in order to overcome years of rape or incest. We've not been afraid to do that. And I think that that has helped. One of my things about women's ministry and the ministry to children--I wanted to do a real strong prison ministry.

White women organized around that issue and--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Here's what happened-- Speaker 1: --and it filtered to us. Speaker 2: When the white Women's Movement began, lesbian women and women who had been real victims of men started joining the movement and really and truthfully, it was not even women who were real victims. I take that back. When lesbian women joined the movement, their issues of, and issues of child abuse came out. Before then, those wealthy, white women were looking at economics solely. Lesbian women joined, issues of gender discrimination really came up, but also issues of child abuse, molestation, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, domestic violence, rape. All those issues really began to surface, and you are right for many black, activist women, domestic violence came up as a big issue. Child sexual abuse, incest, all of those issues really came up, and, truthfully, it was the Women's Movement and the voice of lesbian women that created children's rights. We didn't have real children's rights back then, and that's when children's rights had--so if there, if there was a huge contribution then, of course, it was the fact that the rights of children was born as a result of that Women's Movement. But, you know, there are a lot of thinkers, especially thinkers of color and women thinkers of color, who believe that the Women's Movement and the white Women's Movement was a--was--what's the word I want to use? It circumvented the rest of the Civil Rights Movement because the Civil Rights Movement was really perceived as being a black movement for the most part. And in our community, black men were like lifted up. They got the jobs. They found their voic
. They found their place, short-lived, but, in fact, did. I believe had we been politically allowed to continue, even after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, if we had begun to continue to take that force and continue the work, we would have heard the voice of black women in a way we would have never have heard it. And it wouldn't have been just singular black women like [HM] Angela Davis. There were a number--C. Delores Tucker. There were a number of women but singular in their voice. I believe that we would have heard the collective voice. You'd have seen more sisters in the streets, not rioting but reclaiming our families and members of our families. We would have had a great voice, and I just think it was political. This is just my own exp- you know, sometimes I'm a conspiracy theorist. I just believe that our movement was circumvented by the white Women's Movement. I believe that. Speaker 1: Do you think it siphoned off energy from black women that they would have used had the issue still been civil rights? Speaker 2: I think it was a political maneuver. That's what I think because had the voice, collective voice of black women been allowed, politically, to rise up, we would have brought the other sisters of color with us, and it would not have become a white Women's Movement after that."

I think by '85 [1985]--oh, I know, between '81 [1981] and '85 [1985], I worked for the Child Abuse Prevention Program [sic., Child Assault Prevention Project]. Sally Cooper was the director, CAP, that's right, Child Abuse Prevention. And actually, I found the job in the Call and Post. They were looking for a part-time writer to develop a curriculum for special needs kids on child abus
 prevention. And they hired me because my--you know, I have a undergraduate degree from Norfolk State [College, later, Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] in special ed [special education] and a master's from Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] in learning disabilities and behavioral disorders.

And it was absolutely the most mind-changing experience of my life. Twenty-two days in Africa--I had never been to Africa. This was my first time, and I felt like I was from Nairobi, Kenya. I felt like I had gone home. It was amazing. I did not feel foreign. I did not feel like I was a black woman going home, you know. I just felt like this is where I belonged. I met the most incredible women, market women, bank presidents. Story_ID: 174797 Speaker 1: We--and I don't know how this all happened because you were kind of like on your own in Nairobi, Kenya, but I met a, like a media person--maybe somebody like Bradley, Bradley--what's his first name? Speaker 2: Ed Bradley? Speaker 1: Ed Bradley, somebody like Ed Bradley in Nairobi, and he took tons of pictures of me and the women I was with [at the Third World Conference on Women]. And he got us into all kinds of receptions with the president, the president's wife. We went to, oh, we went to many receptions that probably would have never gotten into 'cause, you know, we were just women going to the conference. Speaker 2: Now, who was the president then (unclear)? Speaker 1: Oh, I do not remember. I don't. Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of it myself and I can't--I'm drawing a blank here. Speaker 1: But his wife was very active in the women's community, and so it was just wonderful. Speaker 2: Now, was Wangari Maathai involved? Speaker 1: Yes, yes, but I didn't know her then.

Speaker 1: --yes, knew what she was doing. Speaker 2: She organized women and just, you know. Speaker 1: Right, but this was, so this was in '85 [1985]. So, she was just early starting out. But one of the things that happened maybe that first four or five days, even if you couldn't speak each other's language--'cause there were like fifteen thousand women from around the world, I mean literally around the world. No matter where you were from, there were certain things about you being a woman that you could share with a woman from anywhere, from Bangladesh, from Sweden, from Canada, from a small village, from Ghana, I mean just everywhere, small island off the, off the coast of South America. No matter where you were from, it was like--it was like all the men of the world had gone some place, agreed how they were gonna treat women, and then went back home because no matter where this woman was from, we all had the same stories about childbirth. We all had the same menstruation stories. We had all the same horrible stories about how we were treated in every place. You know, women were raped in every place, they were beat up in every place; they, they, women talked about their stories of misogyny, they talked about their rights of passage stories that were awful, just--and then somehow this gloriousness of being a woman and finding your own voice, and your own sense of agency, and not wanting to lose that. It was, it was miraculous. I came back home, and I was, I was so fired up. And what I said to my friends is, ""When these--when I meet with these white women and we start talking about policy--"" because at that time in Columbus [Ohio], the white women were starting to galvanize around women's health issues. And I was right there at the table, sometimes one of maybe two black women or sometimes the only black woman.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they were organizing around health issues. That, that was one of the really big issues in our state. And Judi Moseley, white woman, was working for the Ohio Department of Health and she was the director of women's health for the State of Ohio. And so she was bringing women together just to talk about the disparity in women's health and the kind of things we could do. Riverside [Methodist] Hospital [Columbus, Ohio] was beginning to conceptualize the Elizabeth Blackwell Center. And Elizabeth Blackwell was one of the first doctors either, I think in the country, first woman doctor in the country, but certainly here. And Annie Argo, whose husband was the founder of Argo and Lehne Jewelers was the chair of this women's health initiative because she was gonna be the first director of the Elizabeth Blackwell Center at Riverside Hospital. So she was pulling all these women together. We were talking about health disparities, blah, blah, blah. So I was part of that already. So when I got back from Kenya [after attending the Third World Conference on Women], I was like, okay, I'm not being a member of anything unless I'm gonna be a policy member. I was very clear about that. I was not gonna be invited to be a token or anything. Now, I wasn't, but, you know, I just--I came back militant, you know like, you know, I'm putting down exactly what my standards are gonna be and you know, what I'm gonna be doing, and they were like, okay, you know, whatever you want.

Only the first chair in a courtroom--meaning the most senior State's Attorney in a courtroom--could determine the level of plea bargains in certain kinds of cases--crimes of violence, murder, rape, home invasion. That was when the law changed as well, to make it a Class X, so those crimes got greater penalties and no probation, which meant those cases had to be tried. So, that whole law and order mentality made for a more tense time, because you had cases that suddenly--where maybe you could have plea-bargained for something less than prison time--now automatically carried a prison sentence. So, unless the State's Attorney was willing to reduce the charge, you were going to be going to trial on these cases, because there was really no alternative. So, you didn't sense a change, in terms of the way the police or the State's Attorney dealt with crime.

When I began my gender explorations, I actually began by looking at what feminist were doing--some of the issues that feminists were raising in theology. So I was looking essentially at feminist theology. But as I was studying the work of feminist, you know, tensions of theologians, you know, I was increasingly struck by the lack of me, the lack of my presence, you know, the lack of African American female presence as I studied feminist analysis, the whole notion that women's experience has been ignored historically in the doing of theology and in the doing of any other disciplines as well and the notion that women's experience really essentially has been defined by men and in the interest of men. I found all that to be true, but that's not the whole story. I was not finding African American women's presence in what women were saying. In other words I was studying white women's experiences as a source for doing feminist theology. So what that did for me then is that it told me that I needed to go and look someplace else. So that sent me to slave and ex-slave narratives to look at African American women's contributions in the area of defining African American women's reality and African American women's reality in our understanding of religion. In my research I was struck by a couple of slave, ex-slave narratives, and I really do not remember, I really need to look this up. I don't remember if these were two separate narratives or the same narrative. I think there were two separate narratives. But one narrative--in one narrative the slave--ex-slave was talking about the devotional life of the slave--of the mistress of the plantation. And she noted that the mistress would, every day at a certain time, she would sit in the parlor and read the Bible, do her Bible reading, devotional reading for the day. And then there's another slave narrative, I think the second slave narrative that I read where the slave or ex-slave was talking about having been beaten, having been ordered beaten by the foreman because the mistress had ordered the foreman to beat the slave, because the mistress had just discovered that the master of the plantation had sexually abused--had raped the slave woman. I call it rape; the text may not have used for the word rape, but it referenced sexual relation with the slave woman. Speaker 1: Who was she? Speaker 2: I call it rape because if you don't got freedom then you don't have the freedom to say no, you know, so it's rape. Well I couldn't reconcile those two narratives. One narrative talking about a woman sitting--a mistress sitting in the parlor reading the Bible as her regular devotional life, and the other narrative talking about the mistress on the plantation ordering the woman to be beaten because she got angry and upset and I guess in her disempowered state, she couldn't do anything to her husband, so she wanted the slave woman beaten. Story_ID: 187180 Speaker 1: And I kept asking myself, what was that woman reading in that Bible? What was that Bible telling her about what goes on outside that parlor that she was sitting--that parlor window that she was sitting in front of? What was that Bible telling her about how slave women, black are being treated on her plantation, even if this is a different (unclear), that's not the point. But the question what was the Bible telling her about slavery, about (unclear) slavery, how a people are systemically dehumanized, disenfranchised, disempowered, dehumanized day after day. What was that bible telling her? What that left me postulating then is that there's a radical difference between the experiences of the daughters of slaves and the experiences of the daughters of slaveholders.

And I'm packing her around the corner to bring her to some of the women who, you know, lived there, cause they looked out--everybody looked out for everybody else's child.

Speaker 2: Well, well that during the Civil Rights Movement but even earlier than that there was a black man who was electrocuted after many years of appeals and they (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh right. Speaker 2: --for raping a white woman [Willette Hawkins] who-- Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: --when actually it wasn't a rape, he had been seeing her on the side, she was married, they got caught, [Willie] McGee, I think, I think his name was. Speaker 1: I think you, I think you might be right. I've heard this story and-- Speaker 2: Yeah, right. Speaker 1: --it was, the way it was told to me, now tell me if you remember this 'cause you were living there, there at the time. They said that when he was electrocuted the lights actually dimmed in the homes-- Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: --and stuff. Speaker 2: Yes. I and because actually, and, it he, and I guess it was the first time that they had appealed for, it was a number of years from his actual arrest and trial to the execution. And probably the first time that a black man had ever been able to be processed even through the appeals system. But there was ample evidence that that it was not a rape but the fact was it was a black man involved with a white woman and it had to be nothing less than, than a rape. And so I remember when he was electrocuted for that. For me that, that was the first time I remember I understood the horror of segregation and Jim Crow. Speaker 1: And the interesting thing about that too is that, on some level and as crazy as it is, that's some kind of a victory that he actually got on trial, right? Speaker 2: It is. It is. And it (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even an unfair trial. Speaker 2: Right. And even though people, blacks in Mississippi knew what the outcome would be and I guess I must have been five or six years old, I wasn't that old, but just old enough to understand that something wrong was happening here, something was going on. And I can remember the conversations between the adults, the fact that they would allow him even to appeal through the process was new because ordinarily, he would have just been hung on the site. And-- Speaker 1: Now-- Speaker 2: --and nothing would have been done about it. But the fact that they allowed him to remain in jail and to go through the appeal process of trial and then electrocuted legally was in itself a victory.	Speaker 2: I think probably the one that that that stands out in my mind most is the event of the, the black oh, shoot, I'm blocked, I'm blanking on his-- Speaker 1: The young man that was killed? Speaker 2: Well, well that during the Civil Rights Movement but even earlier than that there was a black man who was electrocuted after many years of appeals and they (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh right. Speaker 2: --for raping a white woman [Willette Hawkins] who-- Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: --when actually it wasn't a rape, he had been seeing her on the side, she was married, they got caught, [Willie] McGee, I think, I think his name was. Speaker 1: I think you, I think you might be right. I've heard this story and-- Speaker 2: Yeah, right. Speaker 1: --it was, the way it was told to me, now tell me if you remember this 'cause you were living there, there at the time. They said that when he was electrocuted the lights actually dimmed in the homes-- Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: --and stuff. Speaker 2: Yes. I and because actually, and, it he, and I guess it was the first time that they had appealed for, it was a number of years from his actual arrest and trial to the execution. And probably the first time that a black man had ever been able to be processed even through the appeals system. But there was ample evidence that that it was not a rape but the fact was it was a black man involved with a white woman and it had to be nothing less than, than a rape. And so I remember when he was electrocuted for that. For me that, that was the first time I remember I understood the horror of segregation and Jim Crow. Speaker 1: And the interesting thing about that too is that, on some level and as crazy as it is, that's some kind of a victory that he actually got on trial, right? Speaker 2: It is. It is. And it (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even an unfair trial. Speaker 2: Right. And even though people, blacks in Mississippi knew what the outcome would be and I guess I must have been five or six years old, I wasn't that old, but just old enough to understand that something wrong was happening here, something was going on. And I can remember the conversations between the adults, the fact that they would allow him even to appeal through the process was new because ordinarily, he would have just been hung on the site. And-- Speaker 1: Now-- Speaker 2: --and nothing would have been done about it. But the fact that they allowed him to remain in jail and to go through the appeal process of trial and then electrocuted legally was in itself a victory.

In 1964, she graduated, having written newspaper articles about Mormon womanhood, ran off to Las Vegas [Nevada] with her boyfriend at the time, (whispers) had sex--one night and so woke up and got married the next morning in Las Vegas in an orange mohair dress at the Hitching Post Chapel (laughter) and that was my sister's father, so she married him, she lived, had my sister [Elizabeth], lived for a few years, and then suffered through first the divorce with him, and then eventually from his suicide after they divorced, found herself a single parent with really no place in the church that had such traditional roles for women and so she went through the highly radicalizing experience of going to graduate school, went to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] in sociology, studied criminology, but especially women in the criminal justice system, wrote a master's thesis about women's sex workers and the experience that these women were having and the ways in which they were being exploited and also girls and women in the criminal justice system and the ways in which they were being often incarcerated for what were called ""status offenses."" So, a girl would be raped by her stepfather and she would run away because she had been sexually assaulted and then she would be put into juvenile detention because of a status offense of being a runaway.

411	Harris-Perry, Melissa	HM	1973	1970	WA	Black or African American	Graduate or professional degree	Married (except if separated)		2014.0	41	"Speaker 2: So, I was in college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and doing all this activism, and, or what I understand to be activism, campus protests, you know, kind of campus as a laboratory, all of that is around race. We are identified, in fact, we threw campus Kwanzaa every year, we saw ourselves as bringing racial presence to the campus. I did, I did almost nothing with women's organizing on campus. Now, I took women's studies classes, I read bell hooks, but I, in my actual work I did almost nothing around womens'--unless it was black womens--work with an emphasis, probably, on the racial aspect of it. It was really in graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina] when I started to identify with two important things; one, that I was a rape survivor which, although it occurred before I ever even left to go to college, I'm really rare--I don't know that I ever really talked about it in college. I certainly hadn't even disclosed it to my own parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] until senior year, maybe even, either senior year of college or first year of graduate school before I even disclosed that it had happened, even though it happened when I was fourteen. I just did not talk about it with any--when I was 14, I told one person, a friend, and no one else until I was about 20. And so, as I started engaging both my own kind of personal healing around it, started to disclose it, started to think of it as part of my identity as being a sexual assault survivor, that draws you into doing women's work in a different way and I also started reading a lot of work by African American women who were rape survivors and, of course, almost all of us are survivors of rape at the hands of men who are black, because everyone is most likely to be sexually assaulted within the context of their own race. It's not that men are most, that black men are most likely to be rapists, but they are most likely to be the rapists of black women, just as white men are most likely to be the rapists of white women. The--""We must save the endangered black man, we must rally all together, our unity is more important than anything else""--starts to fall apart when you are willing to be very honest about the amount of intra-racial gender violence, and it was something that even though I had experienced it, I just hadn't dealt with it or thought about it, or theorized about it, or put it in the context of my work, and once I started doing that, it forced me to say, ""Okay, how do I love the race? How do I talk about this notion of black masculinity and black manhood, but have a place to talk about what happened to me at the hands of a black man."" And, the more that I did that and the more that I started, you know, you start just following, I try to get my students to read this way--you read one thing and that person mentions something and then you can read that person since you are kind of, you know, doing this intellectual history just through reading what the people that you're reading are reading--and when I started to
do that, all of a sudden I realized, Oh, my God! Every time people would say, I could remember conversations in college where we would say how bad slavery was, in part because black women were raped, and if black women were raped that meant black men could not protect their women. I could remember these conversations as though the main victim of rape is the man, whose manhood is somehow damaged by this. I can remember us saying in Kwanzaa, like, ""We must protect the black woman who is our community's greatest resource."" Ahhh--she is the community, like, push her over as the resource in part, because black sororities and fraternities come out of an era of uplift. There is also a lot of weird, like gendered stuff that goes on about being ""the backbone,"" so even though Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] is this black woman's organization, also sometimes reproduces a respectability politics that still has a relatively constrained notion for who black women are, and so you learn those things as mantras that you repeat because you're proud of the organization, and it wasn't until I start reading some of the critiques that I was like, ""Oh, yeah, woah. That is a problem."" So it really, it was this kind of personal moment of changing my identity from, like pan-Africanist, nationalist, black girl, to pan-African nationalist black girl rape survivor, to ""Oh-wait a minute, that is going to have to change my whole analysis,"" and so by the time, and, I'm also by the way encountered Wahneema Lubiano, who made me read a whole bunch of other things and also just made me stop saying certain kinds of things and I met my very best girlfriend [Blair Kelley], who is the second half of my brain and she has never been anybody's nationalist nothing, and so she critiqued and she challenged. She is a historian, actually a dean at North Carolina State [University in Raleigh, North Carolina] right now, so, as a historian she would push back against some of the kind of ahistorical, racial things I would say and so some of it was my identity, some of it was my friendship, some of it was what I was reading, but, you know, by the time five years of graduate school passed, I had a very, very different world view. Story_ID: 564909 Speaker 1: So I want to go back, you mention that you are a rape survivor and you didn't tell your parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] for a long time. Speaker 2: I don't, still never told my father. I mean, he watches the show so I guess he knows, but I never said it to my father, yeah. Speaker 1: Did your family know this person? Speaker 2: He was our neighbor, which is why I did not tell, so this was after we had moved and my mother had gone through a lot to buy the home, so this is the first time we lived in a single family home. It was the first home that she herself had purchased and bought, and the fact we built it. Not a fancy house, just very basic, but it was the home that she built. A nice little, you know, neighborhood, still two, my two best friends in high school [Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia] lived in that same neighborhood. This man, his backyard, so we were a corner lot, his backyard abutted ours, and he was a father, African American man, married, was a father of two children and lived there all through my high school, (not my, he wasn't there in high school) high school years, college years. I finally told, I might be getting this timing a little wrong, I think I told junior or senior year of college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. I told my mom and then, and it was because she kept bugging me. Some mail for him had come to our house and she kept asking me, I was home on summer or Christmas break, and she kept asking me to take it over to him and I wouldn't and I'm not, I mean, I'm rebellious but I'm not disobedient like that and she could not under--and finally, she was like, ""Take the mail over!"" and I spilled why I wouldn't. Of course, at that point, so much time had passed no one at that point was talking and we just didn't do anything legal, but then, and this now, I'm sure I've got the timing right on this. This, the second year of graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina], and this is hard to believe but he actually hit me in the face. He was walking. In certain ways this galls me even more because, like, all right, but I was standing in my front yard, it was Christmas, I was coming home. He was walking his dog past our front yard. The dog comes into the yard to use the bathroom, which I just saw as --- and so I screamed at him to get his dog off my yard because--Jesus!-- and then he screamed back, came into the yard, we got into each other's face, and he hit me. So I called the police for that! Right? End up in court and telling the judge who this person is to me, what he had done to me, and the judge, (unclear) judge says, ""well, I mean, I don't know anything about that, if there is any report of anything like that; this just sounds like neighbors and so go home and be nice to each other."" And, basically you know my mom's enjoyment of that neighborhood ended from the time that she knew, so she had enjoyed and loved her neighborhood, she is a gardener, she always loved to garden, but like her garden was the line of their property and so it really, so, part of the reason I never told was because sure enough, once I did and once that happened, it just made the whole experience for everyone there very, very ugly and awful, and it wasn't long after that, after the court thing happened, because even though the judge did nothing, his wife heard me say what I said and people who rape teenagers, grown men who do that, are not single-time perpetrators. It's never true, and I suspect that as the wife she also understood that he had probably perpetrated in other circumstances, whatever those were, because very shortly thereafter their marriage broke up and the family moved, but yeah, and again, I talk about being a survivor on air, but I have never had a conversation with my father about it."

And that was one of those times that was like you know when I think about sort of like that water shed moment of how like you're in high school and you're like going through all the dorky, awkward high school stuff, like it all came together for me after that retreat. And there were all sorts of things that they did to us during that time, very psychological but very effective. Like one part of the retreat was a night where they had all of your parents write a letter to you of every kid and then they read the letters out loud. And it was like, you know, everything you could possibly imagine you know from parents saying you know I know my alcoholism has been a problem to parents saying you know things, you know my sickness or whatever it is, things that you necessarily didn't know about your friends, and just you know every child in the room was undone. I mean it was like you were a puddle. You just couldn't even--and it just sort of gave you such an appreciation for all the issues that people around you were confronting that you really didn't understand because you only saw them a certain way, a certain part of their life, a certain part of their day. And the other thing that they did was then everyone who had ever gone through the retreat, they had write you letters. So you'd go back to your room that night and they had a big huge envelope on your bed and your bed was filled with letters of people who knew you who had written to you from high school and your teachers. And it was one of those moments where the whole headline that they gave us during that period was you know they said that most kids are really insecure and you know doubting of themselves and lacking confidence. And the line from the retreat was ""I'm loveable because God doesn't make junk."" And we had these buttons that we wore. And you know in hindsight it sounds really hokey but it wasn't. And so then when you sat down with these letters where people like basically poured out their heart to you and told you why you were so special to them, it was like you know it was beyond touching, beyond you know anything I ever imagined. And then when we came home, we'd been gone for two days and they, you know you're just, you're worn out emotionally. And they--one thing I should also say, they had each teacher get up and give a talk about their life and other students did the same thing. And their talk would end and begin with a song and then it would, they would tell you things that you just, no teacher had ever told you before about, you know things that had happened to them or what have you. And you know from one teacher telling us how her sister was raped and killed you know all sorts of things. So again it's just emotionally, emotionally draining. And basically them trying to prove to us, life is just hard. There are things that are beyond your control. You got to pick yourself up. You're a good person. You have to strive to continue to be a good person, that sort of thing, that kind of message. We come home and they say you know we got to pick up all of your stuff in the library. The library at Ignatius is at the top of the building. You walk into the room and they had the music playing from someone's lecture and your entire family there to pick you up. It's like you know, and you walk in and they're all just clapping for you cause they know you'd gone through this like really emotional experience and so then everyone starts crying.

I'll just give you an example of the, the cruelty of the, the place, the shocking cruelty. There was, the, they have classification systems in prisons. And the classification system by type of crime, violent, those kinds of characteristics. The Georgia State Prison had a policy of placing the young inmates, the first offenders, in with the homosexuals, because they said they didn't fight as hard as the older prisoners, and it was a way of pacifying the population. So I got, this is outrageous, I got a letter one time, an anonymous letter from someone who said there was a young inmate who had been viciously gang raped in the dormitory and that this inmate was writing to say couldn't we help to try to get this kid out. So I called for the--an opportunity to meet this young man, and he came out, and he was not as big as I am, he looked like he didn't shave yet, little young, in for car theft, first offender. He was obviously, mentally, completely out of it. I mean he couldn't, he was having hallucinations because every time I talked to him he was doing this, looking around, he was hearing voices. I talked to him for about an hour, trying to get him to say anything. The only thing that he said, I said, ""If I could get you out of here, where would you want to go?"" And he finally said, ""Home."" So I wrote on a yellow pad a temporary restraining order application, I served it on the warden, and then I appealed to him as a human being. I said, ""Look, you know, we can go and try to torture the judge into having a hearing, and, and do all this and get the lawyers involved."" I said, ""But surely you don't want a young man just to be viciously gang raped over and over again in your institution, under your own humanity. Won't you please move him?"" And so they moved him, but listen to what happened. They moved him from the open ward, where he had been victimized, to the hospital floor, and they locked him in a cell so that nobody could get to him. Now this is inhumane for somebody who's mentally deranged and, and needs help, but he's at least protected from people being able to get to him, so I thought. I learned about a week later when I came back to the prison, that at night the inmate orderlies had the keys to the cells, and that they had victimized this young man while he was up there in the hospital floor for his own protection. Now to me--we later got him sent to a mental hospital. And I hope that they were able to do something to restore him to sanity. But to me, that is a classic example of the kind of vicious inhumanity and disregard for people. And any system that would treat young people that way, or have a classification system like that, is an abomination.

And he looked me in the eye, he said, ""What?"" He said, ""I was his cellmate for a year, they never tested me."" So you see the indifference with which human beings lives and wellbeing.

And on my mother's side were the field slaves. And my grandmother left Kentucky and went somewhere and got near the Mississippi River, and she and two mules somehow made it across the Mississippi River because she was trying to get away from the master who was molesting, of course, all the young girls her age. That grandmother was twelve years old when slavery ended. So, she had been born, well, both sets were born in slavery. And she had actually somehow--. Speaker 1: So she was born about 1850, I guess, 1851, 1850--. Speaker 2: Fifty, forty--forty-nine, forty-eight [1848].

She came out of there and landed, landed someplace on the other side of the Mississippi and then came back from Kentucky--. Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now this is from Kentucky. Speaker 2: Yeah, from Kentucky. Now I, I don't know where her travails took her with this, these two mules, but she was determined that she was not going back. And so for some reason she ended up swimming the Mississippi River--her and these two mules that we heard about. And then she finally landed--when she finally landed in Georgia, I believe, is where she met--came back to Georgia is where she met my grandpa.

And my grandmother left Kentucky and went somewhere and got near the Mississippi River, and she and two mules somehow made it across the Mississippi River because she was trying to get away from the master who was molesting, of course, all the young girls her age. That grandmother was twelve years old when slavery ended. So, she had been born, well, both sets were born in slavery. And she had actually somehow--. Speaker 1: So she was born about 1850, I guess, 1851, 1850--. Speaker 2: Fifty, forty--forty-nine, forty-eight [1848]. And was about the time I was getting good and grown, why, she was almost a hundred years old. She came out of there and landed, landed someplace on the other side of the Mississippi and then came back from Kentucky--. Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now this is from Kentucky. Speaker 2: Yeah, from Kentucky. Now I, I don't know where her travails took her with this, these two mules, but she was determined that she was not going back. And so for some reason she ended up swimming the Mississippi River--her and these two mules that we heard about. And then she finally landed--when she finally landed in Georgia, I believe, is where she met--came back to Georgia is where she met my grandpa. And they then got together and started traveling toward California where all the gold was supposed to be. And they ended up in Oklahoma, between Oklahoma and Kansas.

In terms of the inmate situation, women incarcerated has typically been associated with sexual abuse of these women in early life. Now, does it mean that more women are being sexually abused? I'm not sure, exactly. Are more women being abused in general? Again, I'm not quite sure about that, but there has certainly been a surge. It used to be when I talked to a teenager about selling drugs it was always a guy; not so any more. There are more and more women; girls are out here selling drugs, okay?

Throws her into the closet naked and then she opens the closet door and saw the defendant put the gun to the guy--to his childhood friend's head and shoot him, and blow off his head. Then turned, opened the closet and shoots her in her stomach, where she's running and she survived. She runs out, and I hope I'm not getting to graphic, where she could see her intestines and everything hanging out. And what was so sad about--well everything was sad about the case.

So, I was this person coming from Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island], didn't--not understanding. And I wrote about--when I wrote about the needs, I talked about teen pregnancy, domestic violence, and rape.

And he had circled, you know, like sexually active and--'cause it was at a time when that's what--that--you know, even then, and by then it was '81 [1981], you didn't talk about it. You know, domestic violence was something that everybody knew was going on but nobody talked about, you know.

My mother [Irma Armstrong Jefferson] told me about that. In that generation, meaning my mother was born in 1916, that generation and earlier, they could be wary about discussing, you know, white ancestors because, you know, the stain of illegitimacy, or rape, or et cetera was all there. So, I did not hear that probably until I was in college [Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts]. Speaker 1: But you knew that there were people who were fair skinned in your family? Speaker 2: We knew we had--yes, absolutely, we knew we had white ancestors. But it was also rather a point, you know, black people have different opinions about this. Actually, some were quite proud, especially if they can claim, you know, descent from some aristocratic white ancestor. I didn't know that any black person ever boast about being descended from, you know, the local overseer okay (laughter), but, but (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Although that was probably even more (unclear).

451	St. John, Bonnie	HM	1964	1960	MI	Black or African American	Graduate or professional degree	Married (except if separated)		2016.0	52	Speaker 2: So I left the White House [Washington, D.C.], and went home, and I got pregnant and had Darcy [Darcy Deane] and started a business. So I thought this was a good idea. To quit my job, get pregnant, and start a business, all at the same time. It was very difficult. It was kind of like that first week of skiing. It was very, very challenging. I was exhausted, I only had like twenty hours of babysitting, and was, you know, so starting a business was really slow. I quickly realized, most entrepreneurs were working sixty hours a week, you know. And I was working, maybe fifteen, you know, hours a week. And so things that would take an entrepreneur a week, it would take me a month. And so it was slow going, and it was exhausting, and I was a new mother, which we know is hard. Plus, I was starting to have a lot of the anxiety issues about the sexual abuse, and so it was hard getting started, but I wouldn't trade it for anything, because I was able, I had always--when I was in fourth grade, I was writing my first book ['Succeeding Sane: Making Room For Joy In A Crazy World,' Bonnie St. John]. I had always wanted to write books. And reading books had been my solace. I read books on the playground when other girls were playing double Dutch jump rope and hopscotch, and I couldn't do what they were doing, I would sit and read a book. And I would travel on adventure. I would be a superhero in the book 'cause I couldn't do it on the playground. And I would read a Nancy Drew book in one night. I would go in the bathroom and turn the light on and stay up and read a book, you know, at night. They were my escape venue. My, where I could dream, where I could be someone bigger or better. I could explore a mental world. And so I always wanted to write because books had given me so much. I wanted to do that. So getting to start my own business, get my first book contract with Simon and Schuster [Simon and Schuster, Inc.], write a book and then be at home, you know, in the afternoons and I could teach my daughter to swim in the pool and take her for walks in the park, and I was able to create a life for myself that I wanted.

452	St. John, Bonnie	HM	1964	1960	MI	Black or African American	Graduate or professional degree	Married (except if separated)		2016.0	52	"Speaker 2: So she moved to San Diego [California] with my stepfather, who was Paul Cremaschi, and he was my evil stepfather. You know, he was a--he sexually abused my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I. I, again, these are things you don't realize 'til you're older. So she was in Detroit [Michigan], a single mom with three kids, struggling to make ends meet. When she--I think she was still in school when my father [Lee St. John] first left and she had three babies and she was trying to finish her degree so she could be a teacher. She--the story she told me was that she was told by welfare that if she wanted welfare, she had to quit school. And I--those were the rules back then, I don't know. And she didn't want to, and the only reason, the only way she was able to stay in school was she got a loan from the Jewish Free Loan Society [JFLA]. So again she had, you know, because she had had the connections with the Jewish family, she was able to make this connection and get that help and stay in school, and finish and then get her teaching degree, and she started teaching in Detroit. So Paul Cremaschi came along and married her, and took her to San Diego. And when you think about that, she was, she was twenty-seven, he was sixty-seven when they got married. He was, he was preying on a vulnerable, poor black woman, far away from her family, with two young daughters. He married her and took her further away from anyone she had ever known, and was able to prey. He was able to prey on my sister and I for years without being caught, or stopped, or questioned, or anything. I believe now that this was, you know, something he did to probably hundreds of kids over the--his career, and he targeted us because we were vulnerable. And again, I think that's gotta to be the story of so many young black girls. He was white, but he targeted a vulnerable, poor, single black mother with two daughters. Speaker 1: And did your mother ever know that this was happening? Speaker 2: The hundred thousand dollar question everyone asks. I used to say no. Because you don't want to believe that. I think, probably the best way to say it is she had been so abused, she was fighting so many demons, she was sexually abused in her own childhood, and she never got healing from that. She struggled with so many demons about race, about that. She had seen lynchings when she was younger. She had a lot of difficult stuff going on in her head, and she tended to dissociate. So I remember telling her when I was eighteen that I was abused. And she basically said, ""Well, so was I. Get over it, move on."" There was not a lot of warmth or sympathy about that. It was, ""Move on. I don't really wanna hear it."" And, and I think some of that is her guilt, right? She had guilt around it so she just, is like, and her own pain, right? It brings up all her own pain. So she dissociates separate. Years later when I wrote my first book, 'Succeeding Sane' ['Succeeding Sane: Making Room For Joy In A Crazy World,' Bonnie St. John], that was the first time I mentioned in a book that I had been abused. And we were gonna go on 'The Montel Williams Show,' and they called her up and said, ""We want you on the show."" And you know, they were doing the pre-interview, and they asked her, ""When's the first time you heard that she was abused?"" And she said, ""Well, this show."" So she would continually forget. My sister tells a story that she was at an event, it was a community event with lots of people, and my sister said something about being abused. And my mother turned to her and said, ""You have abuse in your family?"" I mean, there was a dissociation that continuously went on. But the most painful thing for me, when I started doing my own healing work around this, and I started being willing to focus on it honestly, and process some of what had happened. There's a story that my sister tells. I say it's a story, you know, it's, it's true
 She told my mother when she was nine or ten, that something--she got in trouble for doing something. And she said, ""This is because, this is what's going on."" She was doing something sexually inappropriate, and she said, ""This is why."" And what she says is that mom said to her, ""Well, has it stopped? Is it not going on anymore? Okay, well then, forget about it."" Basically, the same thing she said to me when I was eighteen, she said to April when she was nine. And I had heard that story, and I thought it was horrible. But I didn't really process it, and it wasn't until I was in my thirties, wasn't until I was in my thirties that I did the math. If my sister was nine or ten, I was still being abused and nobody asked. Nobody checked. 'Cause I was abused from the age of two to the age of seven. And so this question of, did my mother know, is complex. She had, she had issues. Story_ID: 521602 Speaker 1: How did it stop? Speaker 2: I went to therapy when my daughter [Darcy Deane] was young, and I had to. I had, what I had done, okay. I had literally forgotten about it. I had forgotten, erased the memories from the time that it happened until I was eighteen. And what happened when I was eighteen is my stepfather [Paul Cremaschi] died. And I've come to understand, if you read about it, that this is a common thing. That when the perpetrator dies, you feel safe enough to bring the memories back. And so, it's the weirdest thing, because it's not like one day you wake up and go, ""Ah. I was abused. Ah!"" You know, it's like the best way I can explain of what it occurs, how it occurs in your brain is it's like a path. Imagine that you live in a neighborhood and you walk around the neighborhood, and there's this road, dirt road that kind of goes off. And you just haven't walked down that path in a long time. You know it's there, you know you were down there years ago, you know it's there, you just never think about it. And so you walk past every day and you never go. And then all of a sudden, when you're eighteen and you walk down that path, and you go, ""Oh, yeah. I always knew this was here, but I just never went."" And so it doesn't shock you. It doesn't surprise you. You just realize, ""I remember this, and I haven't remembered it for ten years."" Anyway, it just, I know if people haven't experience that, it's just impossible to imagine. But at eighteen, I remembered that I was sexually abused. And I only remembered little snippets of it, but I talked to my mom [Ruby Page Schwimmer] about it. But it wasn't until I had my own daughter that it started to become a real problem for me. So I just shut it down, I just, my mom said, ""Don't think about it."" I said, ""Okay."" But once I had my own daughter, the pain started to bubble up in many ways, and I didn't realize that that was what was happening at first. But things like, when she would come home after school, I would black out. Because that's when I would be abused, is every day when I came home from school, and he was there and my mother was at work. And so there were, there were things--and I say blackout. Like, we'd be playing and I would just fall asleep. And I didn't, this would repeatedly happen in the middle of the afternoon. And it's, you know, it's crazy stuff is happening, and the anxiety was coming up, and it took me a while to put together what it was. And that if I wanted to be a mother, I needed to treat it. And I think that's one of the things when I look back, my mother never did the healing work. And that's part of the reason why she missed all the signs and she couldn't, you know, and I realized, if I don't do my healing work, my daughter could be abused and I might fall asleep and miss it. (Laughter) You know? So I was motivated to do the work. And some people, you know, I am a strong person of faith. And I think for me, at that time, I was working on my prayer life a lot, and that gave me the strength to do the work. But I don't believe, some people believe if you just forgive the past, and pray, you're done. I had to do more than that. Maybe that works for some people, but I had to go to therapy, I went to a hypnotist that took me back, so that's why I know that it ended when I was seven. I'm sorry, you asked me, ""How did it end?"" And I know this because I went into therapy and because I did the hypnosis. Gosh, this is hard. So he had been abusing me for years. He had been playing little sex games with me after school, when I would come home from school. And, and, especially when I was in kindergarten, you know, I'd get home earlier than my brothers and sisters. You know, he was able to have time alone with me. And I think one of the unwritten rules was that no one spoke. That you didn't speak when these things, the unspeakable, right? Because nobody spoke. When I was seven, I said something and he immediately stopped his activities and left, and it never happened again. Okay, this is the really hard part. So in the hypnosis, I had to go back and relive some of these things. And it was very judicious about the healing. About--because what you're trying to do is go back and unpack what happened, and what you learned to believe because of the things that happened. And you want to be able to undo that process of creating false beliefs about yourself and about the world. And, which would be things like you don't matter, and you don't have any value, and your value is only as to pleasure somebody else, you know? You have to undo all these beliefs. I felt like it was a process of, like the Greek myth, when Hercules goes back into Hades and goes in to save someone and pull them out. That I had to do these therapy sessions, to go back and find this child and bring them out of Hell. It was a very difficult period. Story_ID: 521603 Speaker 1: But reliving that memory of the last time he sexually abused me (crying), the most horrible part about it is that the child became very depressed. Because as a child, I was sad that the abuse stopped. Because it was a feeling of affection and warmth and love and it was, I don't know, it was normal. It was what was there. And so I thought I had done something wrong. That was the third grade, and I got all Cs in third grade. I was always a straight A student through my whole life, and I remember I got all Cs in third grade. And I think, I never put it together, until much later, until I did this hypnosis and I understood. I became a very depressed child because I had done something wrong and I was being punished by my stepfather [Paul Cremaschi]. And, any sane adult human who looks at that and says, ""How can you twist a young child into somebody who would become depressed when it stops?"" It's horrible (crying). Speaker 2: Did you find yourself angry with your mother [Ruby Page Schwimmer]? Speaker 1: Not until after she died. My mother was an amazing person. It's so funny, given what I've shared with you. It's gonna be hard to reconcile with that, with the fact that she was an educator. She was looking after everyone's children. She was the principal of many schools, and she made a very positive difference in not only the lives of the students who were there, but the teachers and the parents. She died at age sixty-seven, and at her funeral, over three hundred people came and spent hours telling my brother [Wayne St. John] and my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I what she had done for them. And how much she had done for them. That she had kept kids in school who, you know, gotten them off drugs and somebody said, ""She helped me find a husband."" You know, or parents, ""She helped me get back in school."" Or teachers, ""She helped my further degree."" And, you know, she did so much for so many people. But when you look back, she was a very, you know, her life, her childhood was so horrible, she was fighting with demons. When I was growing up, she used to take us to motivational speakers, she used to spend hours writing affirmations. Writing positive statements over and over again. So what I learned from her was that her life was messy and painful, but she fought to try to stay more positive. She didn't always win, but she fought for more positivity for herself, for her children, you know, even though, okay, she made this one really big mistake with marrying Paul Cremaschi, and not being able to see the signs. But she filled our house with books. She made us love education. She supported our interests, whether it was skiing or my brother's photography. He built a--he's a photographer now. He built, she bought him his first enlarger to develop pictures, at a pawn shop. You know, and helped him build a dark room in the garage, and she gave us so much. It's--at her funeral, my brother's speech, he said, ""She was the best of moms, and she was the worst of moms. But she was never in between."" So I valued my relationship with her. When she turned sixty, I took her to England for a week, we spent a week in England together. Shortly before she died, I got to speak on a Disney cruise [Disney Cruise Line] and I took her with her. She loved, me with her, she loved Disney [The Walt Disney Company], and Roy Disney [Roy E. Disney] was on the ship. And Jennifer Hudson was singing on the ship, and it was an amazing trip. I loved my mother and I wanted that relationship. But after she died, I think I was willing, I was willing to admit more things to myself. And it's like what I said about when my stepfather died. You're willing to go down roads that you didn't go down for many years. When my mother died, it felt like, you know if you took a beach ball, and you pushed it under the water, and then you took your hand away, it would shoot up? That's what it felt like to me, is that there was all this stuff that had been pushed down for so long, and it shot up after she died, and I couldn't stop it. So I was, I had a lot of anger after she died that I had to process. But I didn't share that with her. Story_ID: 521604"	"Speaker 2: So she moved to San Diego [California] with my stepfather, who was Paul Cremaschi, and he was my evil stepfather.

Speaker 2: Did you find yourself angry with your mother [Ruby Page Schwimmer]? Speaker 1: Not until after she died. My mother was an amazing person. It's so funny, given what I've shared with you. It's gonna be hard to reconcile with that, with the fact that she was an educator. She was looking after everyone's children. She was the principal of many schools, and she made a very positive difference in not only the lives of the students who were there, but the teachers and the parents. She died at age sixty-seven, and at her funeral, over three hundred people came and spent hours telling my brother [Wayne St. John] and my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I what she had done for them. And how much she had done for them. That she had kept kids in school who, you know, gotten them off drugs and somebody said, ""She helped me find a husband."" You know, or parents, ""She helped me get back in school."" Or teachers, ""She helped my further degree."" And, you know, she did so much for so many people. But when you look back, she was a very, you know, her life, her childhood was so horrible, she was fighting with demons. When I was growing up, she used to take us to motivational speakers, she used to spend hours writing affirmations. Writing positive statements over and over again. So what I learned from her was that her life was messy and painful, but she fought to try to stay more positive. She didn't always win, but she fought for more positivity for herself, for her children, you know, even though, okay, she made this one really big mistake with marrying Paul Cremaschi, and not being able to see the signs. But she filled our house with books. She made us love education. She supported our interests, whether it was skiing or my brother's photography. He built a--he's a photographer now. He built, she bought him his first enlarger to develop pictures, at a pawn shop. You know, and helped him build a dark room in the garage, and she gave us so much. It's--at her funeral, my brother's speech, he said, ""She was the best of moms, and she was the worst of moms. But she was never in between."" So I valued my relationship with her. When she turned sixty, I took her to England for a week, we spent a week in England together. Shortly before she died, I got to speak on a Disney cruise [Disney Cruise Line] and I took her with her. She loved, me with her, she loved Disney [The Walt Disney Company], and Roy Disney [Roy E. Disney] was on the ship. And Jennifer Hudson was singing on the ship, and it was an amazing trip. I loved my mother and I wanted that relationship. But after she died, I think I was willing, I was willing to admit more things to myself. And it's like what I said about when my stepfather died. You're willing to go down roads that you didn't go down for many years. When my mother died, it felt like, you know if you took a beach ball, and you pushed it under the water, and then you took your hand away, it would shoot up? That's what it felt like to me, is that there was all this stuff that had been pushed down for so long, and it shot up after she died, and I couldn't stop it. So I was, I had a lot of anger after she died that I had to process. But I didn't share that with her. Story_ID: 521604"

I can do this on my own. I'm gonna look cool. I'm gonna be cool. I'm gonna be like everybody else,"" you know. And when I had my daughter [Darcy Deane], and then the pain of the sexual abuse started coming up, I couldn't do it on my own anymore, and the pain was so intense. I was going through that process of going back over the memories, and doing the healing, and I was still a mom. And I would have to come back and be a mom, dry my tears, and come back and be a mom, or go and give a motivational speech for everybody. And because I had to hold it together for my daughter, sometimes when I would fly to another city to give a speech, that was when I could break down and cry, and just let the pain out. And I remember I was in a hotel room, and I was supposed to give a speech, and I was laying on the bed and just sobbing. And just--the pain was just coming over me so much, I couldn't get off the bed. I couldn't get up. And I remember, I just said, ""Help me, God."" And it was like it lifted and I could get off the bed. And that was a moment for me that I thought, this is real. This isn't talking to your invisible friend, God is real, and I want to know more about that. And so, having to go through that difficult healing process really brought me back to God and really helped me, inspired me to explore my relationship with prayer.

472	Jones, Elaine	HM	1944	1940	VA	Black or African American	Graduate or professional degree			2006.0	62	Speaker 2: I mean there was a time that you know often, there were white females who would accuse my father and I--of being fresh. Now my father, like most men you know, most men who are--who see a woman who is attractive and all, you know they, some way they're going to respond. Maybe to themselves, they won't have an outward response but they're going to respond to it. And--but my father knowing, that the livelihood of his children and his wife [Estelle Campbell Jones] depended upon his decorum, had too much sense to have casual flirtations. He had too much sense for that. So a couple of times he got accused and the union was able to deal with it you know, and it didn't affect him. He was able to move on. But that has always you know made, it made me aware when I first came to legal [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] first as a lawyer, the plight of African American men and what men can endure when a woman makes a false claim. When a woman makes--it's an awful thing to do to a man. And so I come at it from that, you know. And I you know I think about all the death penalty cases I handled with men on death row for allegedly raping white women, throughout the South. When I became a lawyer that's what it was. And that's where I spent the first four years as a lawyer, fighting that, you know. So my father's experience I think shaped me in that 'cause he would come home and the union had to go to bat and blah, blah, blah, blah. So he had the--and then he had a couple of experiences--but they had a pleasant experience. He would come home and somebody gave him a big tip. That was a big deal. You know you could buy a week's groceries for eight dollars, then. I mean money was--you know eight dollars you'd buy a week's groceries and daddy would get a big tip and just be just tickled, you know.	Speaker 2: I mean there was a time that you know often, there were white females who would accuse my father and I--of being fresh. Now my father, like most men you know, most men who are--who see a woman who is attractive and all, you know they, some way they're going to respond. Maybe to themselves, they won't have an outward response but they're going to respond to it. And--but my father knowing, that the livelihood of his children and his wife [Estelle Campbell Jones] depended upon his decorum, had too much sense to have casual flirtations. He had too much sense for that. So a couple of times he got accused and the union was able to deal with it you know, and it didn't affect him. He was able to move on. But that has always you know made, it made me aware when I first came to legal [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] first as a lawyer, the plight of African American men and what men can endure when a woman makes a false claim. When a woman makes--it's an awful thing to do to a man. And so I come at it from that, you know. And I you know I think about all the death penalty cases I handled with men on death row for allegedly raping white women, throughout the South. When I became a lawyer that's what it was. And that's where I spent the first four years as a lawyer, fighting that, you know.

And I, and I actually have done a number of lectures on sexual harassment issues because I have won a couple of big cases, very high-profile cases for my clients. But I, but the issue of sexual harassment is one that has really grown in the last 10 or 12 years, in part because people now are recognizing that the kinds of things that women--and by the way, I mean now, men are actually filing lawsuits for sexual harassment. But this is primarily been an issue of, of women and a lack of power that women have in the workplace. And so what I do is we, I do sexual harassment training so that we spend a lot of time at our clients' offices teaching people from, literally, from the C.E.O. to the person that empties the trash, about sexual harassment, about the responsibilities of the company, that the companies have, encouraging people to come forward to make a complaint. The way that the law has been developing in the Supreme Court is that a company really has to have a program, a procedure whereby a person who feels that they've been sexually harassed can make a complaint. If you have that procedure and you have trained your staff and people know that the procedure is there, then a person can't show up at the courthouse door a year later, two years later and say, ""Well, I knew about the procedure, but I was afraid."" And so what we're really doing is educating the public, that if you feel like you've been sexually harassed, you need to complain to your employer. You need to make them do an investigation. They should do a prompt investigation, and if they find that there is sexual harassment, they need to stop it or else that company is gonna be on the hook for paying big damages to their employees. So I'm, I'm spending a lot of time doing the education and, you know, also occasionally, trying a case every once in a while."

But I, but the issue of sexual harassment is one that has really grown in the last 10 or 12 years, in part because people now are recognizing that the kinds of things that women--and by the way, I mean now, men are actually filing lawsuits for sexual harassment. But this is primarily been an issue of, of women and a lack of power that women have in the workplace. And so what I do is we, I do sexual harassment training so that we spend a lot of time at our clients' offices teaching people from, literally, from the C.E.O. to the person that empties the trash, about sexual harassment, about the responsibilities of the company, that the companies have, encouraging people to come forward to make a complaint. The way that the law has been developing in the Supreme Court is that a company really has to have a program, a procedure whereby a person who feels that they've been sexually harassed can make a complaint. If you have that procedure and you have trained your staff and people know that the procedure is there, then a person can't show up at the courthouse door a year later, two years later and say, ""Well, I knew about the procedure, but I was afraid."" And so what we're really doing is educating the public, that if you feel like you've been sexually harassed, you need to complain to your employer. You need to make them do an investigation. They should do a prompt investigation, and if they find that there is sexual harassment, they need to stop it or else that company is gonna be on the hook for paying big damages to their employees. So I'm, I'm spending a lot of time doing the education and, you know, also occasionally, trying a case every once in a while."

So we were, we, we went there in his defense and we were met by people with their guns and waving--they knew we were coming for the demonstration. And we called the state troopers, state--they did called the state patrol to let them know that but they ignored it. And we went to the church and made sure everybody was disarmed. That's the way they always did in marches and decided that we could not let the [Ku Klux] Klan keep us from marching. So we set out to march. Normally I marched with my husband. But this time he said, he felt the danger involved and he said, ""You'd better drive the car,"" 'cause he knew I was going to go. And I drove the car by myself. No one was in with me. So as we rounded the corner going down the street downtown Decatur we saw this mob. And we were within the block where they were and they started shooting. And they immediately rushed to my husband and the front line and took them away. A couple of kids were struck but not seriously. And then they ran back to my car. They knew the car and--because they had seen us when we came in. They ran back to the car, the whole mob, and shot in the car. The first bullet hit right here, this little side panel by my head. And then the, I, I, I was, I went down to the seat of the car, went down because I felt that that was it, they were going to, you know. So the next bullet did come right over the steering wheel and glass and everything flew all over me. And I, I had my foot on 
he brake and I didn't know what to do really. But I said, ""Well--,"" and I could hear them hollering at each other, ""Don't do that, Sam!"" So and so and so and just, you know, just talking to each other. And so I thought the next moment they were just going to come and shoot me in the car. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: But a few moments elapsed and I said, ""I've got to do something. I can't just sit here forever."" And I said, ""I will look up and see if anything is in front of me. If not I'll just shoot off."" And that's exactly what I did. I decided all of a sudden look up and there was nobody in front of me and I just shot off and found my way back to the church--little church where they had gathered. My husband by then was on his way back down there to try to look and see what was going on with me. But, but that's the way that ended. That was a terror--I think that's as close to death as I will ever come. And that was quite an experience I had to live through."

. So the Ashanti are known for their warrior culture. The Ashanti are known for being fierce warriors. When those slaves were captured in what's today present day Ghana and were taken across the Atlantic and were taken to Jamaica in order to be broken in, the word they used was seasoned; they would season them. The slave owners would break their spirits and teach them how to be subservient or that was the goal, submissive. It didn't work so well in Jamaica. The Ashanti are actually the group that is the majority of the Jamaican population; more than 90% of Jamaicans are of Ocond or Ashanti descent.

Another woman who came in had been raped. And so it was all these different types of deliveries and experiences within that weekend. And it did not discourage me at all. I loved it even more.

Speaker 2: Well, one of the things--my mean my dad [Floyd Joseph Malveaux] being a doctor, he always wanted one of us to be a doctor. So he was kind of pushing that along. And I had thought about it because I loved biology and I thought about delivering babies. I thought that that would be the most noble thing to do, to bring children into the world. And there was one weekend that he actually set me up at D.C. [District of Columbia] General with one of his buddies, who's a doctor, who's an obstetrician. And we put our scrubs on and we did deliver babies together for a weekend. And it was actually kind of the most horrific experiences of childbirth, because you had a lot of people there, no prenatal care--very, very poor--emergency deliveries. Nothing was pretty. We had one woman who was obese and was a heroin addict and her baby was dead inside of her and had been inside of her for a while. But because she was a heroin addict, she hadn't naturally delivered. So, I was with this doctor, Dr. Lawer was his name. And we came in together with our scrubs, and I was just his little assistant. And she was there, and she was very angry, very upset. I think she might have still been high, and she was cursing at him because she was one of the only white people in the hospital because D.C. General mostly is predominantly black. So she was cursing at him, accusing him of, you know, undermining what was going on, you know, her baby and all that stuff. So it was really strange and disturbing to see. There was another young, young woman, a teenager. It was like her second or third child. Nobody was there with her. Nothing was happening on time, so she didn't have time for any medications.

[identification] card and everything to go to our table, someone would come along and smack your tray up like, (gestures with hand hitting upwards) you know, and that would 'cause your food to go all over you or the floor or both. And my--and those six of us would have to get used to that because we'd have to go back through the line and get some more. But, also, one day we found that the men who--you had to take your tray over, your empty tray over and give it to--go through this conveyor line to put your dirty dishes in place. And the men who worked behind there were usually black men and sometimes they would make remarks to the women. And sometimes they would-- Speaker 1: Derogatory remarks? Speaker 2: Well, or they'd say, ""Hi baby, how are you"" or something. ""We're glad you're here"", even was a derogatory remark because we were supposed to just go through and put your glasses here and your plates there and your knives and forks here and get--and they were supposed to clean up the dishes. But they would say things as if they were on the street and--to the black women. They wouldn't say it to the white women, but to the few black women who were there. So one day, I reported them and told the dean of women that I was extremely uncomfortable and that these black men were harassing us and, of course, we didn't have sexual harassment at that time. And when I went--she gave me an audience and I went to the meeting with her. And when I got there she said, ""Well Sylvia, they're your kind."" And that didn't--that only added fuel to the fire because I--there was no--what I'm saying is you asked me how did I feel? There were--we felt as if there was no place to go. You could not--we were not--oh, I mean, I'm seventeen years old. I'm in this strange environment. I don't know anything--I don't know a lawyer. I can't--it's not today, where everybody understands civil rights and appeal rights. I'm just a kid. And, you know, I grew up in an environment where I had no rights. Even at home, I had no rights 'cause your mother would tell you in a minute you know. You don't have a social security card yet. You don't have any rights. So times were very, very different in terms of children's rights, your civil rights, your personal attitude. The only--the thing that I felt I had going for me was that I was there with a scholarship from the state legislature and this was a state institution. So I used that as leverage. If you don't treat me right the state of Maryland will know about it because I'll call Mr. [Marvin] Mandel."	"Speaker 2: The first week when we would go through the line and pick up our tray of food, as we came by the cashier with our I.D. [identification] card and everything to go to our table, someone would come along and smack your tray up like, (gestures with hand hitting upwards) you know, and that would 'cause your food to go all over you or the floor or both. And my--and those six of us would have to get used to that because we'd have to go back through the line and get some more. But, also, one day we found that the men who--you had to take your tray over, your empty tray over and give it to--go through this conveyor line to put your dirty dishes in place. And the men who worked behind there were usually black men and sometimes they would make remarks to the women. And sometimes they would-- Speaker 1: Derogatory remarks? Speaker 2: Well, or they'd say, ""Hi baby, how are you"" or something. ""We're glad you're here"", even was a derogatory remark because we were supposed to just go through and put your glasses here and your plates there and your knives and forks here and get--and they were supposed to clean up the dishes. But they would say things as if they were on the street and--to the black women. They wouldn't say it to the white women, but to the few black women who were there. So one day, I reported them and told the dean of women that I was extremely uncomfortable and that these black men were harassing us and, of course, we didn't have sexual harassment at that time. And when I went--she gave me an audience and I went to the meeting with her. And when I got there she said, ""Well Sylvia, they're your kind."" And that didn't--that only added fuel to the fire because I--there was no--what I'm saying is you asked me how did I feel? There were--we felt as if there was no place to go. You could not--we were not--oh, I mean, I'm seventeen years old. I'm in this strange environment. I don't know anything--I don't know a lawyer. I can't--it's not today, where everybody understands civil rights and appeal rights. I'm just a kid. And, you know, I grew up in an environment where I had no rights. Even at home, I had no rights 'cause your mother would tell you in a minute you know. You don't have a social security card yet. You don't have any rights.

516												Speaker 2: My mother's name, from what I know, was Anne Johnson, and her story is a bit more complicated. My grandmother whom I did know, her mother, was raised in New Orleans [Louisiana], which I did go visit there after she left. My mother was born--my father [William Streeter], I didn't say, my father was born in two thousand--1906. He was eighty-eight when he died. He was ninety- ninety-eight, I guess, or ninety-six, something and my mother was born in 1912. Now I didn't learn any of this about my mother until about nineteen ninety--1978, '79 [1979] in talking with her because they didn't talk. My mother, my grandmother had three other children before my mother. My mother looks white, apparently her father was, and my grandmother gave her away to a white woman in the town, and I'm not sure if it was Mississippi or Memphis [Tennessee]. So my mother was raised white until she was seven. At age twelve her grandmother, her mother's mother, found out about this and went and got her on the other side of town, so then she was moved and was in the black section. Difficult. Then her grandmother dies and her mother at this point, who I think was probably a woman of the night (laughter); it just does not sound other than that. She had moved to Chicago [Illinois] so she had to move all of the children to Chicago. So there they are in Chicago, my mother, who I never got taller than, and it was just, she went to Wendell Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and that was difficult and I never realized how difficult it was until much later in life. That explained a lot of my mother's moods, and then she was raped at sixteen (laughter). Speaker 1: So she was raised-- Speaker 2: Until she was seven, white. Speaker 1: --white.

And again, based on the C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] Church. And his father's name was Albert Davis, and daddy's mother's name was Ollie Davis. And that's how I got my name. My name Ollisteen, and there was a little change on the spelling, but it was Ollie on the paternal side and Christine on the maternal side; that's Ollisteen. But--and I don't know anything else about daddy's side much except I do know what my great-grandfather's name was Ab [Davis]. And I understand that granddaddy had four brothers who went to Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, and of course, he was there in Mississippi, and another one might have been in Mississippi. But they scattered about. And like granddaddy was born ten years after slavery. And I would talk to him one time. I interviewed him about what it was like growing up in, in that time period. And he would talk about how a black man could be lynched and killed for daring to lift his eyes to a white woman. And when they were walking down the street that they would have to cross over to the other side, rather than be on the sidewalk at the same time with, with, with a white woman. And he said, but they could rape our women and they could do anything they wanted to you know, to, to black woman. And he said and thus the range of colors that we have in the family, the different complexions in the family. But granddaddy was a--an original mason. He could not read or write. He worked on the railroad building all the way up to Chicago [Illinois]. And he was quite the sage, despite the fact that he didn't have a formal education. He was a very, very educated man and a very wise man. And I gravitated toward my paternal grandfather more. I didn't see either one of them any more or less than the other, but I gravitated toward grandpa-- Speaker 1: That's Albert Davis? Speaker 2: Albert Davis, yes.

Well, you know he is conservative, but I, I have nothing negative to say about him since he saved my life, my career. I always ran one of the best offices in the country. I always got a 5.0 rating, and the highest you can go is 5.0. There was a white director who was my boss in district office who decided when he got the job in Memphis [Tennessee] that he had a Puerto Rican friend that he wanted to have my job. So, the first year I got a 4.0. The next year I had a 3.0, and now I'm still doing the same type of work. And so, one of my supervisors, a brother, said that's a pattern, you're gonna get a 2.0 and you're gonna be out the door. So you better start fighting. In the meantime, he started doing all kinds of things to me, having me investigated and just all kinds of crazy stuff. Trying to remove me. You know, with all the years' service I had and so. You know, I just started fighting him and it went to Clarence Thomas and Clarence Thomas sent it to an outside person in Virginia to investigate. And of course it came back just terrible on his part. And Clarence saved me. He agreed with the outside investigator. He didn't have to do that. They can say anything they want. I disagree, she's out the door, you know. So, but I have not heard that he was a bad chairman. Because once you're in the field you don't have the same connections in Washington [D.C.]. I don't know of too many people that he had removed. I just haven't heard anything negative other than that scandal. Speaker 1: Did, did you know (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I knew Anita too. Speaker 1: Okay, I was gonna ask you if you knew Anita Hill as well. Speaker 2: I mean, I believe everything she said. Now I'm not gonna say that, because I just believe in my heart she was a good person. And I guess just young, innocent and vulnerable. And I think she told the truth. But I think in a--in a--when he went from EEOC, I think, to a D.C. court and nothing ever came up, they didn't care. But then to become the [U.S.] Supreme Court person, that's when they cared, you know, 'cause there's too many other good black men out there that have nice clean background, you know. But he--I've been in Mexico at a conference and you'd always see him after midnight, you know how you stay up and party. Come on down there with the white women, dancing and carrying on, you know. He didn't have anything to do with us, you know. But he was respectful. He would speak and all of that, you know. But, other than that, you know. And he--I, I just didn't like him always talking about his, how poor he was and his sister was on welfare, and that was just demeaning to me, you know. Need to uplift her, you know. That was demeaning that he arrived and nobody else could make it out of the family. I think that was terrible. Speaker 1: So that's kind of contradictory to say your sister's on welfare and then not try to help her get off of it, if you're making that kind of-- Speaker 2: Yeah. My sister would've had a job if I were up there, you know, as a clerk-typist (laughter). So, but I, you know, other than that, I, I wasn't, I just wasn't close to him.	Speaker 2: Uh-huh.

Well, let me put it this way. I didn't know growing up as a child how--that everyone didn't live like this, okay. I knew that I had relatives that lived in other areas, but they were poor, too, and they lived in worse conditions. You know, they lived in apartment buildings where rats were running around. And I didn't want to spend the night because they had rats, or they had lice in the bed. So, certainly, where I lived was much better than where they were living. In terms of how other black people were living in the city, I had no clue as to where they were living or what their neighborhoods were like, because everyone I knew lived in a housing project. What I did know for sure is that, you know, I didn't like the violence. You know, I didn't like the fact that you had to protect yourself so much, and you had to be tough. And I didn't like the fact that there was so much sexual abuse and things like that, simply because, you know, people were vulnerable. I knew at an early age, I didn't like that. I knew at twelve and thirteen and fourteen, and certainly going into the teen years, that this is something that I would not want to bring my child--an environment that I would not want to bring my child up in. Now, on the other side of that, did my parents [Carrie Williams Duncan and Joseph Duncan] do their best to make sure that we were taken of? They certainly did. You know, we had Christmas and we had holidays, and we had, you know, the nicest things they could buy. We had full meals. We went to the parks, and we went to the lakefront, and we went to Riverview [Riverview Amusement Park, Chicago, Illinois] when it was open. And all of those things and experiences that they could give us, we had. So, we didn't know how bad off we were. I didn't know how bad off we were, and how poor we were, but I knew that we were poor.	Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I think--no, I don't think I knew how bad it was. Well, let me put it this way. I didn't know growing up as a child how--that everyone didn't live like this, okay.

We wanted to make certain that more women would become lieutenants, maybe captains and working with the police department, we were able to be successful in having those women promoted. We were also able to look at what was happening in terms of sexual assault. We came up with programs there--what the first person--what the first policemen would do when he came to interview, or came to the aid of the rape victim. So we were able to put in some very good programs, and I feel--like I said it was a very rewarding experience and I'm happy that I was able to be a part of it	Speaker 2: Well, I--I really loved that experience because we were able to--you could see the progress that we were able to make in terms of making improvements within city government. Moving those women into high-paying jobs, better positions, changing or starting programs that would enable them to get better jobs. Like I was saying with the [Chicago, Illinois] Fire Department--the fact that once we understood why the women couldn't pass the physical, then we had a program created with the University of Illinois [at Chicago] that actually trained those women in terms of developing their upper body strength and that was really fantastic to have the number of females. It was a large number that graduated because they came out of that program. The same thing when we worked with the [Chicago] police department.

None of them came out the way cause most--Phill [Cheatum] he was married, Alvin Cash, he had a girlfriend and Dave [Anderson] and Bill Radford they had wives you know so I didn't have that problem.

Because if you look at any Africana person--any African American on the street, anywhere, clearly we're all mixed race; or you know, the vast majority of us are. So, you know, this notion of kind of like my mixed race is better than yours because mine was voluntary and yours was rape is absurd. But I notice this kind of pushing of this racial ambiguity in the culture in terms of way people identify themselves, but also in terms of I'm sure you notice this, the visual of ads and commercials and what you s- is being pushed. It's p- you know, ""Are they black, or?"" what's going on."	"My grandmother, Nettie Cox's [Nettie Cox Ransom] mother, Grandma Cox, who was I think about five feet tall, lived--my mother [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson] used to tell the story of her--she grew up with--she lived with her daughter and my grandfather [Freeman B. Ransom]. And she used to talk--she was a former slave. And my mother would say that they would always try to ask her about it and her thing was like, ""I didn't--I don't know anything about that slavery, I was in the big house playing with little missy. That was my job."" Tiny little five foot woman, clearly mixed race, straight hair, looked pretty white, so. Speaker 2: 
ut she didn't talk about any of that? Speaker 1: No, she didn't, my mother said. And then she said they tried for years, all of them, to get her to talk about it. And she lived a long life, so, but she didn't wanna talk about that--slavery. Speaker 2: Or her--what the blood lines were? Speaker 1: Or what the blood lines were--no, no.

go back. There's 300 Klansmen down there and four regalia and they are waiting for you all.

You know you go to talk to a corporate person about raising money for those kinds of programs, and they don't want to admit that exists. They wanna think of happy smiley faces in children and sometimes you talk about daycare and you talking to people who say you know I go to work every day and I pay for my own day care. So, you start talking about subsidized day care. Well people go to work they need to pay for their own day care, why would I subsidize that. So, when you talk about eliminating racism people don't want to talk about racism. They say we get along fine, we don't need to have talks about that, so the fund raising challenge or running the YWCA when you're not running a gym and swim program and there's something that somebody can feel good about and say, I'm taking twenty little poor kids of projects and teaching them how to swim and their playing basketball and they all look happy, when you're talking about those issues that nobody wants to talk about--they're not sexy hot issues; it's difficult, so	Speaker 2: Well, I think some of the challenges are rape is something people don't wanna talk about, sexual assault, child molestation.

A lot of people don't know what. So, they said, you know, how could you be a pro-choice, you know, how could you be a baby killer. I got calls in the middle of the night calling me a lesbian baby killer, 4 o'clock in the morning phone calls. So, once they got themselves organized and put it out there on the internet it had an incredible ripple effect for us. I got five, we kept track of them, 5,088 emails, but really I got about fifty because a lot of them were the same form letter saying the same thing and so that the Christian right is very organized and we ever get as organized as they are and we learn how to get out to our constituents we believe in the elimination of racism and economic empowerment of women and get them to attack the way they did us, we would be light years ahead. Story_ID: 179788 Speaker 1: I often wonder why organizations don't do that or maybe is that, you know when you really look at it is it a really good use of time to organize people to write form letters and send them in to Pat Robinson or somebody to tell them to knock or off or somebody like a Rush Limbaugh or somebody, I mean (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: Well, they're effective in the since that they affect our funders. For instance, the YWCA in Nashville [Tennessee] lost $700,000 dollars as a result of this campaign because, you know, it's the South and they're a little more conservative and the tone of the letter, I mean, you know, then you get in a defensive position where you're saying this is what we're not rather than this is what we are and so you're constantly saying and, and we have such a wide tent. We have some people--like I was on a radio show for instance in Alaska where a guy asked me did I believe in abortion and it was over this issue and I said to him well let's presume, I'm a Catholic, so I don't believe in abortions for myself, but if my daughter got pregnant as a result of a rape I would have to reevaluate my position on abortion and his response to me was, ""Oh come on Ms., come on you know that nobody gets pregnant the first time they get raped."" So, I said to him how many times does somebody have to get raped before they get pregnant? Well, you know what I mean we're going to commercial, so he went to commercial and then he came back and said, ""This is really going to be rough,"" and his callers started calling me and saying how did we call ourselves a Christian organization and, and I told you earlier when I was a kid I went to Bible school and one of the things we had to do in Bible school is learn the Bible verse for every letter in the alphabet. So, I think he met his match because I said to him sir all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, and he was floored. He just--(unclear)--(laughing) and didn't know what to do and then he was clambering on and on and I said to him be still the Lord is in this holy temple. So, then I started running down my ABC's about judging, not lest ye be judged, and finally he hung up and he said, ""All right well we're just gonna have to agree to disagree, God bless you,"" (laughing) and I thought all that Bible school training came in handy. But, it's that right wing, you know, they are, they're very organized and they can affect your funding. You know, we got a lot of letters from people saying I'm never gonna give the YWCA another dime and please take my name out of your records and then we had a little press release that said ask them what is their name so we can take their name out, and they would hang up because they weren't contributing to us anyway, anyway."

575	Peeples, Audrey	HM	1939	1930	IL	Black or African American	Graduate or professional degree	Widowed		2003.0	64	We gave it to [JM] Willie Barrow one year. And we've only given the award--we gave it to Lucretia Bailey who works for the Urban Affairs Institute. And then we gave it to two doctors. One's black woman doctor and a white woman doctor who worked on events to bring children together and its kind--it, it was children of violence. It was taking children out of violence and they're both doctors. One worked on the girl X. Remember the girl X who was-- Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: --and the other one worked on that-- Speaker 2: The girl X was just for those wa, watching this she was attacked with some chemicals or something. She was raped and then, then-- Speaker 1: In Cabrini Green. Yeah she was raped and attacked with chemicals in Cabrini Green-- Speaker 2: Right, right. Speaker 1: --left for dead and is blind now, can't talk, etc.	: And for me one of my crowning achievements is the YWCA has, has something called the Leader Luncheon, which is an event. When I came, was raising $200,000 a year and when I left we were raising $700,000 a year, and it's a luncheon that recognizes women in, in their field for excellence and it's in like education, the business world, non-for-profit, community service. That's a major thing, so that we've recognized women of achievement. It's called the Women of Achievement luncheon, Leader Luncheon. For twenty-eight years that's been going on. So, most of the women who are the movers and shakers in this city have been recognized. After I came, I said if we couldn't and we were recognizing women in education, business, and I said well how come we're not recognizing women who are doing work in racial justice because there are very few people doing this. So, why don't we give a racial justice award and give this award to a woman who is doing outstanding work to improve race relations in the city. And, if, if we come in a kind of occasion where we can't find a woman who's doing it, we won't give the award and that will say a lot to the community about what's happening in the way of race relations. And so we've given the award to Julia Stasch, you know who became the mayors', working in the mayor's office, but at the time she worked for Richie [Richard] Stein because that, Richie Stein was a large developer in Chicago who Julia was his top woman and she made sure that women and minorities were including on all the construction projects, so she really did a good job. We gave it to a little Jewish woman named Marian Epps who, Miriam Epps [ph.] who lived in South Shore and worked really hard to keep South Shore an integrated community and worked with the National Council of Christians and Jews. And we gave it to the woman who used to head up the Community Renewal Society. I can't remember her name. She was very active in Trinity Church. She's a minister. We gave it to [JM] Willie Barrow one year. And we've only given the award--we gave it to Lucretia Bailey who works for the Urban Affairs Institute. And then we gave it to two doctors.

And you know R. G. Johnson that used to be the old superintendent of schools well her daughter-in-law was the first director of Harris, and she ran that YWCA and had the community involved.

577	Peeples, Audrey	HM	1939	1930	IL	Black or African American	Graduate or professional degree	Widowed		2003.0	64	Well, I think some of the challenges are rape is something people don't wanna talk about, sexual assault, child molestation. You know you go to talk to a corporate person about raising money for those kinds of programs, and they don't want to admit that exists. They wanna think of happy smiley faces in children and sometimes you talk about daycare and you talking to people who say you know I go to work every day and I pay for my own day care. So, you start talking about subsidized day care. Well people go to work they need to pay for their own day care, why would I subsidize that. So, when you talk about eliminating racism people don't want to talk about racism. They say we get along fine, we don't need to have talks about that, so the fund raising challenge or running the YWCA when you're not running a gym and swim program and there's something that somebody can feel good about and say, I'm taking twenty little poor kids of projects and teaching them how to swim and their playing basketball and they all look happy, when you're talking about those issues that nobody wants to talk about--they're not sexy hot issues; it's difficult, so. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: That was a challenge. That was a challenge. The other challenge was in terms of getting a board people who were people of substance because again the YWCA is a women's organization, and we don't have men on board. We have men, women, and so- Speaker 1: Is it, is it by, by design or no, no, no-- Speaker 2: By design. It provides women an opportunity for leadership, so that's one of our goals to empower and, and, and train women for leadership. So, we never have the top people in the corporation on the board.

I almost--I, I have to laugh and look back on what was okay to say then, questions like, well if this is so important, why isn't the, the broader women's community embracing it? Or why isn't the women's community embracing it, assuming that black women are not--you know, it was just--you know-- Speaker 2: Now, this is interesting. Speaker 1: --why don't you have support letters from the (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This, this is interesting because-- Speaker 1: --broader women's community and you sit there and you go-- Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: --well I don't--first of all I don't know what the broader women's community is. I mean, we're doing testimony in front of Carol Moseley Braun and Monica Faith Stewart who were legislators at that time, but wasn't enough, so--

She and Carl Rowan had--one of the first African Americans to have their own little radio stations on--to themselves where they just kind of gave their opinion. I can't--I wanna say 'Perspectives' but I'm sure that's not what it was called, but she was--so I'd never met Ethel Payne. I'd heard of her and she worked for the Defender. She had--she and a group of women, [HistoryMaker] Earlean Collins on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and Rosa Moore [ph.] from the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and some others had put together a group called the Coalition of Concerned Women in the War on Crime. And through this LEAA [Law Enforcement Assistance Administration] program, the same program that sponsored my master's degree, they had gotten money to start this rape counseling service and anti-rape hotline, and they had an office in Englewood, and so (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's the Coalition of Concerned Women-- Speaker 1: Women in the War on Crime.

It was happens that this happened to be a black man and so, I think that (background noise) (laughter). I think that, I mean, it was unfortunate. It was certainly unfortunate. It as certain embarrassing. I mean, you always want people who are in the public eye who you, who are considered representatives of, you know, black America, you want them to be perfect. I mean, we have so few, we want them to be perfect. But, you know what? No one's perfect. And, and, when I say that this is not--I'm not making a judgment about, you know, whether or no
 I was in favor of Clarence Thomas, which I was not."	"Speaker 2: Well, see, I don't think you can have it both ways. As black Americans, you know, you want success. And, so you could, you could argue that, that having a successor to the black [U.S.] Supreme Court justice, who's also black, it's a certain measure and indicator of successful, sort of. Someone recognizing the importance of the black community and that the black community should be represented. And, so, you could argue that that's a certain level of success and with that comes this kind of exposure. I mean, it doesn't happen in a vacuum. It would happen to anyone. I mean, you know, if that was anyone's story, they would've, it, that whole story would've played out. It was happens that this happened to be a black man and so, I think that (background noise) (laughter). I think that, I mean, it was unfortunate. It was certainly unfortunate.

 I was in favor of Clarence Thomas, which I was not. But, you know, I'm really not even making that judgment-- Speaker 1: Right. Speaker 2: I'm just saying that-- Speaker 1: And, that not, yeah, I'm not asking you to. Speaker 2: That it's just, you want the, yeah, you want someone to be--you want it to be perfect, and it isn't. And, so, it was embarrassing. And, but, it brought up a lot of other issues. That again, you know, it's interesting, whenever you try to sweep these issues under the rug, they always have a way of coming out at the worst possible time. And, so, again, you know-- Speaker 1: What issues came out of that, they say? Speaker 2: Well, you know, the--you know, sexism, you know. Sexual harassment in the workplace. These were all issues that, you know--and, and they dealt with it by trying to discredit, you know, Anita Hill. As if, you know, she was trying to sabotage America or something like that, you know. I mean, yeah, she was sabotaging somebody's agenda, you know. Yeah, but, I don't know, I just don't know. I don't think it was proven that this was some sort of put up job that, you know, that someone put her up to it so that this, so that he would be discredited so that he wouldn't be confirmed. But, I don't think that that's ever been established that that was so. I mean, so she just, you know, as a matter of her conscious, spoke out. And, I think it took a, it was a--and I think it took an incredible act of courage for her to do it. And, there was nothing in it for her. And, look what happened to her. I mean, she seems she's fine-- Speaker 1: What happened to her? Speaker 2: Well, she, she, she's--I mean, first of all, she was subject to a great deal of sort of public abuse, scrutiny, unprecedented scrutiny of her personal life. Untru- you know, lies were told about her. And, and, she--I mean, ultimately she went back and someone, you know, ineffective (laughter), degree and I guess, I don't know, you know. And, and she's teaching and she seems to be fine. But, I mean, to have had to, to say--and, she had to know, she had to know once she did that, that she was letting herself in for just an incredible amount potential, you know, abuse and some, and she took it."

Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mean, here you have two black people and so, some people felt, I mean, it depends on how you were looking at it. Some people felt that Anita Hill should never have done that because it's a black man and it's embarrassing and, you know. And, Cla- and other people felt that Clarence Thomas was not the appropriate person to have that job, because, just because he was a black man. He didn't share Justice Marshall's [Thurgood Marshall] opinions and philosophy, and judicial philosophy at all. In fact, he was total opposite that. So, a lot of people felt he wasn't qualified. But, they, they looked for somebody black who, you know, who didn't represent the black community in terms of his, his views. And, so, they felt that he was not, you know, the right candidate for the job. And, so, I, I mean, everybody had a different sort of way of viewing it through this prism, you know. And, certainly, like I said, if it had been a white justice or, you know, person from some other ethnic group and, let's--or Japanese. And, then a Japanese woman came and said, don't--you know, and sort of accused him of sexual harassment. The issue was sexual harassment, really more than race, I think.

596	Pratt, Sharon	HM	1944	1940		Black or African American	Graduate or professional degree			2007.0	63	I think a lot of this attitude was just the individual faculty as well.

And there was a view that why should I waste a limited opportunity to get people placed, African Americans placed? Why would I waste that on, you know, these women? And so, I think they thought they had a very reasoned position of the notion, the notion of sexual harassment. And I don't even think they thought it was, was that. That had gone on so much at Howard undergraduate school. And it, it just, it wasn't considered, you know, you weren't supposed to challenge it. And so, you know, people accepted it. It was amazing.

600	Pratt, Sharon	HM	1944	1940		Black or African American	Graduate or professional degree			2007.0	63	Speaker 2: Well, what I do remember is that sexism was very, very pronounced in the law school. One, as I said, there were only fourteen women in the class. It was very hard. Sylvia Drew was in my class, you know, and it was--I'm just thinking back on some of the women. And it was very hard for us to get called on. You could raise your hand, and they--often the professors ignored you. The only time they wanted to call on you is if it was involving something like rape. You know, it was just unbelievable. It was just so blatant. And so, that was, that was the first time I think I so, was up so, you know, sexism was so apparent, so obvious, so inescapable. Speaker 1: So fourteen women out of how many students in the class? Speaker 2: I guess it was about two hundred students, you know, and there were fourteen women in the class and-- Speaker 1: So, how did that feel? Was there fear? Was there anger? Speaker 2: No, I, I, you know, I'd been well-prepared by daddy [Carlisle Edward Pratt] to feel, you know, I'm supposed to be here. So I, you know, their attitude was not affecting what I thought about, you know, myself. It was just very frustrating to have to deal with it. The, you know, you--not to be able to be called on. If you went to the faculty often for help, they thought you were making yourself available for a pass. So, it was, it was, it was challenging in that regard.

Speaker 2: No, I, I, you know, I'd been well-prepared by daddy [Carlisle Edward Pratt] to feel, you know, I'm supposed to be here. So I, you know, their attitude was not affecting what I thought about, you know, myself. It was just very frustrating to have to deal with it. The, you know, you--not to be able to be called on. If you went to the faculty often for help, they thought you were making yourself available for a pass. So, it was, it was, it was challenging in that regard.

I mean, he was a very, very capable dean. And he helped to establish--he set the bar at the law school. And, but I think a lot of this attitude was just the individual faculty as well. I just think that there was, there wasn't the respect for women in this profession. There wasn't--no one took women seriously. And there was a view that why should I waste a limited opportunity to get people placed, African Americans placed? Why would I waste that on, you know, these women? And so, I think they thought they had a very reasoned position of the notion, the notion of sexual harassment. And I don't even think they thought it was, was that. That had gone on so much at Howard undergraduate school. And it, it just, it wasn't considered, you know, you weren't supposed to challenge it. And so, you know, people accepted it. It was amazing. I mean, this was just still the beginning of the Women's Movement. And so, what had been acceptable behavior before was rapidly becoming very passe.

And that court is not an easy thing. I read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' [Harper Lee]. It makes white children feel good about Atticus Finch, well what about black people when this poor man is about to be murdered for raping someone he never raped. It's not a happy story, it's a tragic--I mean, I love the book, but it's tragic. And it's differently tragic for a black person. So I was scared when I went to court because I was not--all my white friends including at Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] were so shocked by Judge Pannell [Charles A. Pannell, Jr.].

Speaker 2: --I think it was. And then I finished my dissertation while I was living here in Chicago [Illinois]. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: So, but I moved here in 1991, and that was the moment that Clarence Thomas was being nominated for the [U.S.] Supreme Court. And I was involved in another national mobilization called African American Women in Defense of Ourselves, which really tried to add a different voice to the debate around Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. Anita Hill, of course, was the person that accused him of sexual harassment and almost derailed his appointment to the Supreme Court, and she was vilified as someone, you know, who was not trustworthy--she was making this up, she was trying to bring a black man down--and it was a very simplified formula because, of course, Clarence Thomas had, in many ways betrayed the interests of most black people long before Anita Hill's accusations, which I think were quite credible, came to the fore. Speaker 1: What voices in the black media were putting this case together, that she was dragging down--? Speaker 2: I don't remember all the names. I do remember Orlando Patterson from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wrote a piece in The New York Times which was pretty troubling, describing his take on black male/female relations and framing this alleged sexual harassment in that context. And what his position was, was essentially that this was, that what Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of was a kind of flirtation that was common, and that she should have known that this was harmless flirtation, and not kind of outed him. So, you know, I can't even muster the words to express the extent of my disagreement with that, but that was one pretty vile interpretation. But even people like [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, for example, supported Clarence Thomas initially, and said, ""Look, he comes from a poor black background and if he's in there, if he's in the Supreme Court, his experience as a black man growing up in the South under adverse circumstances, that has got to kick in at some point. That has to have an effect on his judgment."" And certainly with all due respect to Maya Angelou, that has not proven to be the case. So, anyway, African American Women in Defense of Ourselves was a group of black women. We mobilized people to raise quite a lot of money in a short amount of time for a national newspaper ad campaign which was, it put an ad in The New York Times and a number of African American papers. We raised about fifty thousand dollars, which was a lot for us at the time. I realize it's probably not now. And sixteen hundred women signed a statement that basically said we felt that black women's voices were not being heard, that Anita Hill was being distorted, and it really was not about supporting Anita Hill in a sort of narrow sense as it was confronting all the misrepresentations of race and gender in the discussion around Clarence Thomas. And it was also indicting, you know, his conservative views as not being in the interest of black folks or poor folks. So that was a major mobilization, it took a lot of time and energy, and it was, you know, it was a success, a limited success. But we made a statement and there was an attempt to organize the women who had signed that ad into an organization after that.

Speaker 1: And some of these men in my house were fondling me. And so, I wrote that. And I also wrote an early incident about what my father [Harvey Reynolds] was doing with me, and I wrote that. But the unfortunate thing was I mixed it all up in a child's imagination. Some of it was the real truth, and some of it was just fantasy. Story_ID: 277790 Speaker 1: And so, my mother [Elizabeth Henderson] somehow found it; my grandmother [Reynolds' maternal step-grandmother, Mae Stewart] who raised me found the little diary. And she thought that was something was terribly wrong with me. And so she took me to a doctor, and the doctor said, ""This child is a virgin. She's making all this stuff up."" And so, what should have been believed was not believed, because it just seemed like it was all fantasy, and some of it was and some of it wasn't. But what happened, she talked to a social worker who thought that I should be put into an institution for evaluation. And so I went into this institution, and they misdiagnosed me as mentally ill. And I ended up as one of the early, one of the youngest persons in a mental institution, which was one of those big warehouses they used to have in Ohio. And-- Speaker 2: So this was--you were about twelve then? Speaker 1: I was about twelve. I couldn't have been, I wasn't a teenager yet. Speaker 2: Okay, so this is 1954 or around that time? Speaker 1: Around that age. Speaker 2: Okay, yeah. Speaker 1: And they, they had done some diagnosis to show that I was insane. And actually, all that was was the making of a writer. But anyway, they put me in this mental institution. And there were horrible stories. There was just... there was this big white woman with blonde hair that fondled me once as I tried to go down these, this winding staircases. I remember a mouse being in my shoe, somebody had put it there. I remember bats flying ahead, overhead. It was, I remember all of us being served food out in the middle of this thing, you know. I remember people screaming at night. And I remember being injected with some kind of drugs. And this was my first experience that showed me that you could change your reality by using drugs. And somehow my grandmother, when she visited me, she could understand what she had really done, you know, and she worked to get me out of there. I can't even remember how long I was there. It seemed like maybe it couldn't have been over a couple of months. But it was a horrible, horrible, experience to think that my first experience with writing made me end up in a mental institution. So, you know, for years I never, ever wrote. I went to poetry, but I never did any kind of self-examination again, or I never put myself in stories again, because I just had this very bad experience of what could happen. It would take me maybe forty years again to write anything personal. But it was a horrible experience. It taught me, you know, not to trust, you know. But I worshipped my grandmother so much that I just forgave her for that, and just went on with life as far as I could understand it."	"Speaker 1: But there was an interesting house next door to me [on Governors Place in Columbus, Ohio]. See, we all had big homes, and we had roomers in them. So, the home next door, I guess it looked very ordinary in the daytime. But at night, it turned into something else. It was like a silk stocking situation. I'm trying to think of a euphemism for what they were doing. You know, I'll describe what they were doing; they were having sex parties. And they were doing the kinds of things people do when they're having a sex party, okay. And I would look in the window at night and see everything that was going on; I was about twelve. And then I had, my mother [Elizabeth Henderson] had given me 
 diary, a little diary with a lock on it. And so, I would write what I saw. And I started this diary, as a little girl might do. I was very interested in Hopalong Cassidy, and Dale Evans, and Gene Autry, and all those. And I used to, you know, just write little stories about that. But then I'd see that, what was going on next door, and it was so interesting about what I'd see grown folks doing. And so I wrote that, and I wrote it in the first person, because I found that that was so interesting. And then I wrote about what some of the older men were trying to do me, as a young girl. Speaker 2: The men that stayed in the rooming house? Speaker 1: No, this was in my own house, we had roomers. Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I mean, in your house-- Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yeah, we had roomers. Speaker 2: --which was a rooming house, yeah. Speaker 1: And some of these men in my house were fondling me. And so, I wrote that. And I also wrote an early incident about what my father [Harvey Reynolds] was doing with me, and I wrote that. But the unfortunate thing was I mixed it all up in a child's imagination. Some of it was the real truth, and some of it was just fantasy. Story_ID: 277790 Speaker 1: And so, my mother [Elizabeth Henderson] somehow found it; my grandmother [Reynolds' maternal step-grandmother, Mae Stewart] who raised me found the little diary. And she thought that was something was terribly wrong with me. And so she took me to a doctor, and the doctor said, ""This child is a virgin. She's making all this stuff up."" And so, what should have been believed was not believed, because it just seemed like it was all fantasy, and some of it was and some of it wasn't. But what happened, she talked to a social worker who thought that I should be put into an institution for evaluation. And so I went into this institution, and they misdiagnosed me as mentally ill. And I ended up as one of the early, one of the youngest persons in a mental institution, which was one of those big warehouses they used to have in Ohio. And-- Speaker 2: So this was--you were about twelve then? Speaker 1: I was about twelve. I couldn't have been, I wasn't a teenager yet. Speaker 2: Okay, so this is 1954 or around that time? Speaker 1: Around that age. Speaker 2: Okay, yeah. Speaker 1: And they, they had done some diagnosis to show that I was insane. And actually, all that was was the making of a writer. But anyway, they put me in this mental institution. And there were horrible stories. There was just... there was this big white woman with blonde hair that fondled me once as I tried to go down these, this winding staircases. I remember a mouse being in my shoe, somebody had put it there. I remember bats flying ahead, overhead. It was, I remember all of us being served food out in the middle of this thing, you know. I remember people screaming at night. And I remember being injected with some kind of drugs. And this was my first experience that showed me that you could change your reality by using drugs. And somehow my grandmother, when she visited me, she could understand what she had really done, you know, and she worked to get me out of there. I can't even remember how long I was there. It seemed like maybe it couldn't have been over a couple of months. But it was a horrible, horrible, experience to think that my first experience with writing made me end up in a mental institution. So, you know, for years I never, ever wrote. I went to poetry, but I never did any kind of self-examination again, or I never put myself in stories again, because I just had this very bad experience of what could happen. It would take me maybe forty years again to write anything personal. But it was a horrible experience. It taught me, you know, not to trust, you know. But I worshipped my grandmother so much that I just forgave her for that, and just went on with life as far as I could understand it."

The thought was that you would never be attractive to a man, you would never be sensually expressive. And also about that time the strangest thing--and I'm, I'm writing about this, there was a Hollywood star called [Roscoe] 'Fatty' Arbuckle. He raped a young woman, and in raping her, she had had a hysterectomy, and he penetrated the bladder. And she died. So, of course, this is not something that you talk about openly, but the thought was if you've had a hysterectomy, you can never have a normal sexual life because you will be ruptured.	": It was not unusual. It was such a terrible story that--of course, I didn't know about it until I was grown up. But I knew that there was always whispering and fear that Aunt Florence might get married. I didn't know why that, I didn't know why this fear was that she might get married. She was a teacher. It seems that there was one doctor, Dr. Martan, who would treat people of African ancestry, he would make home visits. So my, my aunt had this terrible stomach ache, just excruciating. And so my grandmother called Dr. Martan, and he came and he examined her. And he said, ""She has appendicitis. And she has to have surgery."" My grandmother said, ""I can't take her to the hospital,"" because they always--they knew by rumor what happened. And so he said, ""I tell you what you should do. You come to the hospital in the morning. You be there at 9:00 o'clock. Wait for me outside. Don't go in until I come for you."" Well, the next morning my grandmother took Aunt Florence to the hospital, of c
urse, to the back door of the hospital, waiting for Dr. Martan. And eventually this person came out and said Dr. Martan says come in. And my grandmother said, ""No. He told me to wait until he came for me."" He said, ""Well, he's scrubbing up, and he sent for me."" So they went in. And they totally, gave her a total hysterectomy. Her stomach looked like a series of zippers. They mutilated her anatomy. When Dr. Martan came, he came outside and said to my grandmother, ""Where, where is, where is Florence?"" She said, ""They said, you said""--he said, ""Oh, God, I just came."" And when he went in, he told my grandmother what had happened. Story_ID: 12869 Speaker 1: And do you think Dr. Martan--now, was he, he was a white doctor, right? He was a white doctor. Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: And--but the doctors knew that he was to operate. And they knew that my aunt who was a teenager was there for that. So they simply insisted that Dr. Martan had sent for them, and that was a lie. He had not even arrived at the hospital at that point. It ruined not only her life, but the life of the family because it was a disgrace to have had a hysterectomy. The thought was that you would never be attractive to a man, you would never be sensually expressive. And also about that time the strangest thing--and I'm, I'm writing about this, there was a Hollywood star called [Roscoe] 'Fatty' Arbuckle.

So, of course, this is not something that you talk about openly, but the thought was if you've had a hysterectomy, you can never have a normal sexual life because you will be ruptured. They didn't know that a membrane grows, and, of course, they didn't know that the doctors had prepared her inside so that the membrane would grow. They knew nothing about what had happened to her. But they were terrified that if she ever married, and had a sexual relationship, that she would die. And that was the reason for all this fear,"

"Speaker 2: Well, I, my involvement in civil rights came in a very interesting way through the sorority, when I, I had pledged in 1956, and in 1958, I was elected as the second national vice president, which was the undergraduate vice president and I was at school in Indiana of course which was predominately white, there was not a lot of civil rights, anything going on up there, a little bit here and there but not really in the--there were fifty black students at IU [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] and we were trying to get things straight on the campus and we're doing, working on that, the barbershops and so forth and all that. But I was at Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] headquarters for a meeting, executive board meeting, and it was in 1960 and someone came in and told Dr. Jeanne Noble [Jeanne L. Noble], who's also one of my mentors that something was happening and she just interrupted the meeting and she threw her hand up on her head and she said, ""Ah, oh my god, my god. We've gotta do something about that,"" she said, ""We--somebody call Dr. Willa Player [Willa Beatrice Player], the girls at Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina] are having a demonstration in Greensboro [North Carolina] and they are about to close down the middle of the city, and we know that they're gonna need FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agents and people."" 'Cause we thought then the FBI was supporting black people in the South. The Deltas had, they--we thought we had some agreements but any rate, we had a lot of agreements with women, white women and others in the South that when the black girls were being, the kids were being arrested, that they would go and do the bail for the black girls because they were being raped by the jailers at night. So there was all this heightened activity and Delta involvement so, I was saying, ""Well, what is this?"" I didn't know nothing about Bennett at the time and they quickly explained that the Bennett girls were activists and the, that these sit-ins had not worked in February, so they were leading a civil rights march to the down--they were gonna sit down in the middle of Greensboro and stay there. And they were trying to get help there because it was a women's college and there were about six hundred women and others involved, so, all of this flurry. So, that was really ho- and I, and, and in the chapters in the South with things going on and we were doing a lot of through Delta, in helping with the Civil Rights Movement.

She joined the union though, and she didn't let that be widely known because that was a bit controversial if you joined the union. She joined the union, and she was convinced at a certain point that she should apply for one of those jobs on the floor in the production line because she could make more money on an hourly salary. She did, and because she had seniority built up as a maid, she was able to get ahead of some others who had applied for that job. She got the job, and there was resistance to her having the job because she was black, and she was a woman. And it got so bad that white men would spread feces all over the men's restroom, knowing that she had to clean it up. They did all kinds of things to harass her. So she complained, and her union rep and also the person that was the supervisor took my mother's side and told the men that if they continued doing that, they were gonna lose their job. Anyway, it was a big thing for mama to go from being a maid to being a person working in production in this Ace Hardware factory. So that was the kind of thing they were doing. It was very quiet kinds of things, the things that don't make headlines. But in their own quiet ways, they were challenging the conditions under which they were living and working.

They were very much focused on keeping their lives as uncluttered as possible. They didn't wanna make waves.

And apparently, he had accosted the violinist, and tried to engage her in a romantic liaison. Of course, she was having none of that. And he ended up raping and killing her. Well, we knew that the prosecution said that it had confession, a confession from him, but we didn't know the content of the confession.	"Speaker 1: Around that time [1980-1981], there was another case that got lots of attention. And it came to be known in the tabloids as ""The Phantom of the Opera Murder"" case. A violinist in the orchestra at the opera disappeared during intermission. And there was a big search, and ultimately, her body was found thrown off the roof and sandwiched between two buildings, kind of thing. In any case, it was a big mystery. And a lot of people who attend the opera are people who either own or edit The New York Times (laughter) or have friends who were there. So it was a big story from the jump because it affected that part of society in New York [New York City, New York]. And it was my story. So I did a lot of interesting stories related to that trial, and my greatest achievement, I think, was when the--we knew when the trial was opening, we knew at that point that the defendant had supposedly confessed. The defendant was a stage hand. And apparently, he had accosted the violinist, and tried to engage her in a romantic liaison. Of course, she was having none of that. And he ended up raping and killing her. Well, we knew that the prosecution said that it had confession, a confession from him, but we didn't know the content of the confession. So jump ahead, we're there at the beginning of the trial, opening statements by the prosecution and the defense. And the prosecutor gets up and tells us what he's going to prove. And he gives a narration of what happened from the time Helen Hagnes Muntiks, I think was the name, from the time she left the orchestra pit to the time her body was found. And as I'm listening to that, I'm thinking, he's telling us the confession. Who else knew this stuff except whoever confessed? So I wrote a story, rushed and wrote a story that said, we finally heard the details of the confession in the opening blah, blah, blah. So"

In one case, a woman's daughter was killed thirty years ago and just gotten to a place where she knows what happened.

So it was like, we'd better enjoy this moment while we have, because this song that says, ""This may be the last time. I don't know."" We take that literally.

It was nothing that they talked about, but I knew that they knew how to do it and much of it was learned during slavery when black women aborted white babies that were the result of basically rapes by white. So I knew that, but I also knew that white women wanted to raise the level of discussion about abortions because they were talking about your right to determine whether or not you could do that. Black women already knew that if they wanted to do it, they were going to do it. It was nobody's business.	"I learned that you don't talk about the issues in the same language that they had designed. I never forget the first time I was at one of these conferences and women were wearing a button with a hanger on it that said, ""I had one."" Black women don't do that. They talked about abortion in ways that were not comfortable--white women did--for black women, and when I saw--I thought, ""Oh, my God. That's not the way to talk about that."" But I also knew that black women who didn't talk about abortion knew more about it than they were willing to talk about because, don't forget, I had eavesdropped on my mother's [Velma Lee Moore] conversations with her girlfriends and I knew that there were women in our communities who had all of these homemade remedies for how to abort. I heard women talk about falling down steps, about women taking, douching in lye, about women taking turpentine--I heard all those conversations when I was a young girl, and I knew about midwives who performed abortions by dilating the uterus in St. Louis [Missouri] and in East St. Louis [Illinois]. So I knew that black women had abortions, but I also knew it was a very private thing. It was nothing that they talked about, but I knew that they knew how to do it and much of it was learned during slavery when black women aborted white babies that were the result of basically rapes by white.

Black women already knew that if they wanted to do it, they were going to do it. It was nobody's business. White women were trying to get it accepted in the medical world. We didn't have the medical world. We didn't have the luxury of fighting for our doctors to do it. We had the ways to get it done and didn't get it done through doctors. This was done through midwives and other kinds of things that women learned how to do. So we were both talking about freedom of choice and the ability to make the decision if you had to, but we were talking about it in different ways, and so I learned early on not to take the language of the white women back to the black community."

said the door opened, she keep going and never looked back."	"Speaker 1: We had one case in particular, that was--that still shocks me, where we did a compliance review in North Carolina.

They said, first of all they didn't allow her to do anything but hand out the tools, and they called them, as the old folks would say, everything but the child of God, including the C word on the shop floor, and these women were in tears because I'm sure these jobs paid well, okay, but they couldn't stand the--it's a hostile environment and sexual harassment straight up. One woman is a story, I'm telling, it's sounds unbelievable, but, I mean I've heard 'em in other parts of the country, so now I'm convinced it really happened. This woman was being harassed by her supervisor and one day, the story goes, he--she was in the elevator with her and grabbed and basically said, ""I've got you alone now."" They
said the door opened, she keep going and never looked back. She just, you know--I can't stand this anymore, I'm out of here. So I went down there with my colleague from my agency [U.S. Department of Labor] and I said didn't you know this was going on, because the blacks said they tried to meet with him to tell him what was happening, and somewhere in the conversation, he indicated, well, there aren't that many members of the Klan in here. Okay. One is too many. Needless to say, the company was found out of compliance, and of course, they settled, signed a conciliation agreement. Unfortunately, this agency is opposed to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC] couldn't get punitive damages 'cause was a case if ever I had seen one for punitive damages. And after I got back, this gentleman who sounded like an Anglo, if I may so generalize, he said not only were we right in what we found, but there was one guy, the one guy who was a supervisor, they say when he didn't make the meetings, they didn't call him Johnny or Joe, they called him the N, okay. He said the N-word is used all over the place, profusely, okay? They were angry because we always get news releases and the point of that was not to embarrass a company but to show other companies to try to obviously hinder that happening someplace else. It was a way to induce behavioral changes. And they were upset with us, and they called, but hey, that time we did get covered by The Washington Post, in the business section, rarely got covered, but that time we did."

So, when little things started coming here, she doesn't--she's a very family--she was a really the kind of person who wanted to be with her family. So, now we're never home, we're always traveling and she wanted to be you know with her family and she felt, you know, this has kind of hurt her and then when she no longer could sing anything other than our, ""Oohs,"" or, ""ahs,"" that tore at her. So, every little thing started tearing at her and anytime something was not going the way we wanted it, her wanting it or whatever, then it would just, she would get deep depressed, depressed and pretty soon it just really, it really destroyed her. So, that was the first thing that really messed up our, our closeness as friends, and we really, really were close. So, that, that really destroyed everything"

 sitting there and just listening to everyone, and, but my mind and my heart and soul weren't there. I was kind of like thinking about Flo. I mean was just, I was in thought. I remember that very clear, and she had a white fox stole that whenever we were going I would always ask her to, ""Can I wear it, can I wear it?"" You know. I said, ""Make sure you leave it to me you know."" And I remember sitting there thinking about that stole and, and how I had asked her to leave me that stole.

I don't know what I said and then we out to the, you know the hall there and I remember throwing a little dirt on there and said, ""Florence, I'll take care of it.""

No one to help her, no one to guide her, no one to help her through all that pain and I wanted to let people know, you know that she had been dealt that hand. So, I think I have done a lot of that. I know a lot of people would not have preferred me to have talked about her rape, she definitely didn't want to ever say anything about it.

Before her rape, Flo was an earthy, street girl, and if you needed to be told off, Flo would tell off. You know she wouldn't let anybody get away with saying the wrong thing. You know she would tell you, she could tell you, and you know people always could have the last, last say?	Speaker 1: Flo was the kind of person before her--actually before her rape, I'll just say it like so people really understand what it was. Before her rape, Flo was an earthy, street girl, and if you needed to be told off, Flo would tell off. You know she wouldn't let anybody get away with saying the wrong thing. You know she would tell you, she could tell you, and you know people always could have the last, last say? Flo was that kind of way, she always could come up with the right thing would be the--whatever. She always was the kind of person, also was the kind of person who had this very hearty laugh. If Flo was happy, she could laugh and everybody would be laughing, she just had this Santa Claus, ho, ho, ho--kind of laugh, and she was just real. Florence was a real--I would say she was like a real black--have you ever seen a real black good woman? Flo was that woman (laughter), you know. She was that way, but she also had a great voice. I also--I always thought she sounded very much--she had the kind of style of Etta James style. So, she really had a good R and B sound and, and her voice was pure, she had a pure, pure voice, and I think the only thing that really made her--I won't say made her happy, but the only thing that she really--she loved to sing, that's what she loved to do. That was all--I think that was her biggest thing, and then once she was no longer singing, her children were her, the, the love of her life, her children, she loved her children, but singing was what made Flo, so when that was no longer there, she lost a lot of herself.

Speaker 2: You know, I'll look at the funeral program. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: And I'll try to find that for you. But I know that she--I will say this, I think my granny [Willie Mae McNeil Scott] was actually the product of a rape. Because she is very--she was--is--it's so recent that she passed away, but she was very fair skin, she had blue, blueish gray eyes just like my [maternal] grandfather [Robert Scott, Sr.]. She had Indian [Native American] type hair and by that I mean literally you could wash it and dry the car and it still looked pretty, you know, if I do that my hair does a gigantic, you know, Afro poof, you know, so (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I like Afros, you know. Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah. Speaker 1: But, still, I know what you're saying-- Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: --the standards that people have (unclear). Speaker 2: In that time, yeah, in that time it was, you know, you had good hair, or you had bad hair and, and so that was something that was very interesting to me. She also, I think--my grandfather--it's interesting, my great-grandfather [Robert Scott] got married three times. The first time to a white woman [Annie Edmond Scott] and then they had children. And the children came out a little brown and he got divorced merrily. The second, the second was to an Indian woman [Leola Eldridge Scott] and the third was to a very dark skin African American woman [Bennie Carter Scott]. And so when I go to family reunions, there's the whole gamete of skin tones and colors and whatever, so I never grew up with barriers toward just--it was like people are people, you know, this person down the street with blonde hair and blue eyes could be my cousin and that's what I grew up with. Speaker 1: Okay.

He knew the story of, you know, other women as he would say, who had been raped and he was very afraid for me that something bad could happen and nobody would do anything about it.	"And oh, I almost had no dates in college too because my dad [Rubin Wilson], remember was the bus driver for the athletic team. So he called the coach and said, ""My daughter is off limits."" So I became the athletes' best friend and none of them would date me. And they're like, ""We'll get kicked off the team."" So it was just like, it was (laughter) it was, it was not pretty. But I did date a guy and so of course he wasn't on, he was, he had been an athlete, but he is now an engineer and he was older and my dad was just like (sigh) you know, so yeah. I will tell you this. I dated interracially and I still do because that's the environment you grow up in. And my dad was very negative about me dating white men and that changed. But it's funny they raised me to be open minded. And, then guess who's coming home to dinner and you think about 'The Bernie Mac Show.' That was my dad I mean, just horrible to guys--I mean it was just--I watched that movie, I was like, ""Dad, that's you,"" and my dad's like, ""I wasn't that bad."" I'm like, ""You were worse,"" you know (laughter) so that's, you know, and I was like you shouldn't have raised me to care about people if that's what you want me to be. Then I've turned into a racist 'cause I'm not and I care about people. And if it's a good guy, it's a good guy and that's it. And, so, you know, and [maternal] great-granddaddy [Robert Scott] was half white and his daddy [Richard Hill (ph.)] was white. So, you know, what are saying? So it was like this challenge between my dad and I because he knew the story of his mother [Willie Mae McNeil Scott] being raped. He knew the story of, you know, other women as he would say, who had been raped and he was very afraid for me that something bad could happen and nobody would do anything about it. So that was a big clash in college with my dad and I. And my mom [JoAnn Scott Wilson] was like, he's nice, he's cute, you know, so it was like this very interesting dichotomy with us--"
789	Wilson, Robin	HM	1969	1960	TX	Black or African American	Graduate or professional degree	Single		2010.0	41	his eldest brother was a guy named Doris [Doris Wilson]. Doris was actually very smart. He was the product of a rape, though. His--my grandmother [Pauline Ross Wilson] was very fair skinned again similar to my mother's mother [Willie Mae McNeil Scott], and how would I describe it, she was very elegant, classy even, you know, held herself with a regalness that, you know, but she was a housekeeper. But she still was, you know, did quilting and canning of perserves and almost I use--she was the ecofriendly guru to my life, right now if you think about it, she reused everything from aluminum foil to, you know, having a backyard garden. And I think that what I remember most about her is she was a very giving person, a very loving person. The--I'm bouncing around but I will simply say her first son was a product of a rape. She was raped by a black man, so her son turned our very dark skinned, and then all of the subsequent children after she married my grandfather are very brown skinned.	Speaker 2: My father was born in a small town that was a railroad depot that died out, and it's a black town. It was a black town called Littig, L-I-T-T-I-G, Texas, which is right outside of Bastrop [Texas] or Austin [Texas] in this, in the outskirts of the town and-- Speaker 1: Is there, is there a story about the--that town, I mean the name (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's similar to Rosewood [Texas], yep, yep. So you've heard of this, yep and, so that's where all the blacks live now. The interesting thing is if you think about my mother's [JoAnn Scott Wilson] side of the family, it's more of a professional class, educated or at least aspirational to be educated. My father's side of the family was very working class. His father actually helped put the railroads down. Not working on the railroad train but, putting the railroad ties down across the State of Texas. So a working man, and, but Littig was--I actually--my dad--when I was a little girl drove, he drove us to this little town. He did a little turn off and what was left of their property was just a little water spout. And dad said this town used to be a bustling town, railroad depot, and then they rerouted the train away and the whole town died afterwards. Speaker 1: So it is now what they call a ghost town I guess. Speaker 2: It's somewhat--I mean--I think there, there are some development there with, you know, maybe fishing and spa and golf. But it's not owned by black folks like it once was. His, his stories are more harrowing and very sad, and very--dad doesn't ever really want to revisit that and his older brothers and sisters don't either. His family, so-- Speaker 1: Now he really isn't that old. He, he's like well, (unclear) (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My dad is seventy. He'll be seventy this year. Speaker 1: All right. So he was born more like-- Speaker 2: So he was born on June 1st, 1940. Speaker 1: Right. Speaker 2: And he's the youngest, so his eldest brother was a guy named Doris [Doris Wilson]. Doris was actually very smart. He was the product of a rape, though. His--my grandmother [Pauline Ross Wilson] was very fair skinned again similar to my mother's mother [Willie Mae McNeil Scott], and how would I describe it, she was very elegant, classy even, you know, held herself with a regalness that, you know, but she was a housekeeper.

She was raped by a black man, so her son turned our very dark skinned, and then all of the subsequent children after she married my grandfather are very brown skinned. So Uncle Doris--if you think about the timeframe when my dad was a little boy, Uncle Doris was in World War I [WWI]. So my father was a little boy and his older brother was in World War I. So there was this, there was this huge divide almost within the family. Because there's all these children and they're all different ages, and in fact--because by then my grandfather was a bit older, we called him grandpapa, what you actually saw was the eldest son caring for the family with his check.

It wasn't, he didn't try to have sex with me. He put me under a house, where, you know, the house is built on stilts to keep snakes and little animals out of houses. And, and he took my pants down and he fondled me. Well, mom had already told me that this kind of thing might happen. She, my mother was very--we never had baby talk in the house. We never used infantile terms for parts of human anatomy. And she had told me all about this, and she told me, ""If anybody ever did that to me,"" she said ""come and right away you tell me and tell your dad [John Henry Windom, Sr.], and it doesn't matter who it is."" ""It can be an uncle..."" she said; she made it clear. The only man that she really excluded for the possibility that I might experience this was my dad. So, after this was over, I went home, and I remember my parents were sitting at the table. And I walked in telling (laughter) what had happened, and, and I told them exactly what had happened. And my mother said, ""I have to get a docto

823	Martin, Kay	OWHF	1944	1940		White	Graduate or professional degree			2007.0	63	It was a huge decision to go to Ohio State. I had planned to take my son with me while I did that, and then get my degree and come back. There was going to be one job in the state of Oklahoma that possibly would be available, that I might be able to qualify for. So I went based on that job being open and obviously it was and I did get the job. After I got there it was, again, a male dominated program. I thought, What am I doing here as a woman who left her family because she wanted to get this degree for the future? I did not know of any other women and that was what my ex-husband told me. He said, Name another woman who has done this. I could not come up with one, so I thought, This is really unusual. When I got the job as a college professor, I was the only female in the college of business. And it took me awhile to figure it out, but I was sexually harassed for a period of time, and I kept thinking, Something s wrong with me, I m causing that. For a while I just didn t know what was going on. I finally realized that s what it was. So I went and talked to the dean about it and he took care of it right away. But, it was a little painful to go through that because I respected the person and yet I thought it was me and didn t realize that there was more there. So, that was painful. I think sometimes just not having that female role model to say Yeah, somebody has done this before, and somebody has left their family to go do this. It s not, I m not abnormal, and to work through the sexual harassment.	Certainly. When I was teaching in the areas of marketing and business, it was again, a male-dominated area. I think there were not role models in those days to say, Here s how you handle yourself as being the only female. I wasn t quite sure if the group went to coffee or somebody asked me to go to coffee, am I supposed to go? Does that mean it s a date? I worked through it. I was just trying to be as professional as possible but it was really awkward. When I decided I wanted to be a college professor. I needed the credentials to do that. I really needed the doctorate so I researched it. I 10 Nykolaiszyn Martin Nykolaiszyn found out that the best place in the nation to do this at the time was Ohio State. I was living in Arkansas. I had a three year old son and a former husband who told me that, Women don t do those things. So it was a real big dilemma to figure out how I am going to get this degree, if that s what I want to do for the rest of my life and how do I handle all this. It was a huge decision to go to Ohio State. I had planned to take my son with me while I did that, and then get my degree and come back.

It s not, I m not abnormal, and to work through the sexual harassment. Then, once I came here and was in the CareerTech field, my former supervisor and mentor, Bruce Grey, took me under his wing. He took me to the superintendent s meeting and again, there would not be women there. But he treated me so professionally. Everybody else treated me professionally and it was very smooth and so I did not feel tremendous pressure for being a woman, necessarily. Nowadays the climate has changed It has changed, it has. There are those women out there and those administrators, and it is different. I

For example, the girls in pre-engineering will be paired with a female engineer and that gives them a huge opportunity to work through some of those challenges. In our automotive technician program, there s tremendous opportunities for women because they can be so skilled in those areas. But it s a tough, tough thing. Our society still does not look favorably, sometimes, upon women being automotive technicians or they, again, could be harassed	11 Martin Nykolaiszyn Martin Nykolaiszyn That s been one of my passions because, again, when I grew up you didn t go into a non-traditional field. From my vantage point, because I didn t know anyone who had these other positions but the teacher, the secretary or the nurse those were the jobs for women. And so I have felt really passionate about giving women opportunities for other positions because they can do any of those jobs. So some of our non-traditional programs for women would be, for example, the engineering program. I m very passionate about the number of women, they tell me there s about 25 percent, but I think there s less than that because, again, so many young women don t grow up with the female role model of an engineer.

installation for the World Food Administration, and then after a certain time they brought in a man to run it, and he&#039;d had a lot of experience in tabulating. So Mr. Ferguson came in and ran the installation, but there was a turnover because these girls would come from all over the country following their boyfriends or their husband until they shipped out or whatever.

But I never noticed anything with the other, the older; there were a lot of older women, wives, that their husband had gone on to the service and everything. I don&#039;t think the men there really resented us at all. There was a little difference, like [President] Obama&#039;s worried about now, in wages.

And, of course, all the young guys tried to date me, and the married men felt me up, and not only me, but all the women. REDMAN: Now did that really bother people, or was it sort of, the women in particular, did that bother them, or did you get the feeling that that was something that was sort of laughed off at the time? WIKELUND: Well, it&#039;d depend on how graphic the feeling up got. You want to remember we women were just out of the home. The men weren&#039;t used to working around women then. They would pinch your bottom, then squeeze your breasts; they would get you in a corner and try to kiss you. I mean really they were ravenous beasts. REDMAN: Yeah. [laughter] WIKELUND: I mean you&#039;d never put up with it now. REDMAN: Would be considered grounds for being fired, of course. WIKELUND: That&#039;s right. Yeah.	WIKELUND: Okay, I did that for quite a while, several months, and then they needed a woman, a girl, and the guys all like me even though I was married, and I got a better job, and I became a liaison clerk then. I carried messages, I carried important, all kind of important, what do you call those--blueprints. REDMAN: Memos, or memorandum or-- WIKELUND: Yeah, I carried instructions and a whole bunch of stuff all around the plant. And you know, the guys would send me for funny things like sky hooks and all that. My boyfriend, man friend, not a boy, he&#039;s my age, Donald Baldwin, lives in America. He said, &quot;They sent you on these trips so they could watch you walk!&quot; I expect that&#039;s true because the thing of it is there was no sexual harassment law back there, and you really could get yourself into trouble, you had to be really careful. The guys like to feel you up, get you in a corner, and-- REDMAN: Yeah, tell me a little bit about, did your appearance change from the time, because you mentioned that you were wearing the riveting overalls and the scarf for when you were doing that, but then when you transitioned into this messaging job, did you change your outfit? WIKELUND: No, we had to be dressed that way. REDMAN: So you were still moving about the planes and the assembly lines with these instructions. WIKELUND: That&#039;s right. Then there were welders and all kinds of stuff like that, and you really had to be covered decently, none of the way the girls dress now. REDMAN: Right. So I am curious, that is really interesting when you told me that, so there was some, would you describe any of the relationships between the men and the women in the factory as having some hanky panky aspect to them, was there some of that as well? WIKELUND: Yes, there was a lot of that, but since I was newly married, I--but I have to tell you a lot of guys made passes at me and felt me up, and they just did, married men and older guys as well as young guys.

We shut down for a little bit, and that's when we started meeting at the malls. We were meeting at Lakewood Mall. There's no Long Beach Mall, so we had to go to the nearest mall that was nearest one to the city. So we ended up at the malls; we were meeting at the food court. Cyndi Choi was actually the staff person who provided us [with] trainings, and during that time, she was giving us trainings on domestic violence, and looking at sexual harassment, and different trainings on reproductive rights and health, and how to really take care of yourself, and these issues that come up in our community. A lot of it was like sister hating, girl violence...relating to young people. So we were meeting in the malls and then we were meeting at our friend's house...like one of my best friends who was a part of the program, we were meeting at her house for awhile, and it was just like there wasn't any stability during that time.

If it hadn't been, I think that people...if it had been a quieter issue, people would've been able to make their choices in the comforts of their own home and with their own doctors, and it wouldn't have been a highly visible political issue. But because it has become [one], people have had to take public stands on...Which side are you on? And I think that's just brought out a lot more discussion, controversy, and I think there are many many people in the middle. Many people who would make decisions about...If they had their own daughters or their own...who would make a decision one way, who may do that secretly anyhow. Probably the worst politicians are the ones who, if their daughters perhaps were raped or victims of incest or need an abortion, they probably would do it. But from a political standpoint, they can't, because their voters would not, you know. So I think that's really one of the big problems, is the fact that it has become such a central political issue that campaigns are won or lost on the basis of their views. And in that sense, that if...We need to overcome it politically and use all the mechanisms politically, but also people need to be able to articulate and be able to still make their own choices now.

906	Masaki, Beckie	SCAARJ	1957	1950	CA	Asian	Graduate or professional degree			2013.0	56	I think a common misperception was that Asians didn't have this problem of domestic violence, because their families were harmonious, or if they did have the problem, they just keep to themselves, and they wouldn't utilize a shelter. So for me, that wasn't a sufficient answer, because I knew that survivors of domestic violence and sexual violence were a part of our Asian community, and I felt that it was because they didn't have access to meaningful services, that that's why they weren't coming to the shelter or accessing other resources.

907	Masaki, Beckie	SCAARJ	1957	1950	CA	Asian	Graduate or professional degree			2013.0	56	So there's these kind of complicated issues that most of other survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence don't have as much. Also the difference about the crime rings. You know, very sophisticated networks of perpetrators. It's not just one isolated perpetrator that you might have in a domestic violence or a sexual assault case. I mean, sometimes it's very similar.	MASAKI: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of similarities and differences. I think that the differences are...Many times in trafficking cases, there's more than one victim at a time or one family at a time, and multiple survivors. For example, the police did a huge raid, which they called Operation Gilded Cage, and hundreds of trafficking survivors were a part of this case. So then that is a huge challenge. Asian Women's' Shelter, even at that time, is a sixteen-bed capacity shelter, and also sometimes it's supportive for trafficking survivors to be able to be together, but sometimes it's not. And also for the prosecution or the legal aspect, sometimes for legal reasons, the prosecution didn't want trafficking survivors to live together. So there's these kind of complicated issues that most of other survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence don't have as much. Also the difference about the crime rings. You know, very sophisticated networks of perpetrators. It's not just one isolated perpetrator that you might have in a domestic violence or a sexual assault case. I mean, sometimes it's very similar. So in some kind of trafficking, like for example, domestic workers. A lot of domestic workers are trafficked and exploited, and that might be very similar to a domestic violence case, where it's one person that was brought over to be a nanny but then really kept like a prisoner in that home. So in that way, it's very similar to the kinds of situation that, say, somebody who married into a family, where the perpetrator was abusive, her partner was abusive, and even the extended family was abusive. There's a lot of parallels there. So both. There are a lot of things that are the same, and a lot that are different. Also the legal recourse is different. What are the legal remedies that trafficking survivors can access? As well as what the legal remedies for domestic violence survivors or sexual assault survivors [are]. KWON
908	Masaki, Beckie	SCAARJ	1957	1950	CA	Asian	Graduate or professional degree			2013.0	56	aspect of the work. So that's why I would say that a lot of the Asian-based programs for gender-based violence are also...probably if you ask all of them, and now in my new position at API Institute, I see that most all of the community-based groups are working also with trafficking survivors. Whether they advertise that or not, they are. And a lot of the trafficking survivors have the intersection of experience. They have been sexually abused, or they might be children, who grew up with incest or child sexual abuse. They might have been escaping domestic violence or sexual abuse, and then found themselves caught in a trafficking situation, or they might've been trafficked and then sexually abused or in a domestic violence situation. So the intersection of all these gender-based violences really overlaps a lot, and a lot of them ...the survivors...they will tell you the stories of their experience, but they're not going to say, Oh, I'm a sexual abuse survivor, or, Oh, I'm a domestic violence survivor, you know? Those are kind of artificial constructs, based on the law or our definitions, but survivors themselves often have the experience of the overlap of different kinds of abuse that they've experienced.

915	Mingus, Mia	SCAARJ	1980	1980		Asian	Bachelor's degree			2013.0	33	A lot of people weren't going to seek reproductive health, because they had survived sexual violence and they were like, I just don't deal with anything around any of that. I feel like I really...and so many of the people that I talked to and ended up working with had been survivors of child sexual abuse as well, and that that was just something that was a huge barrier around not only them seeking reproductive health services but also in their ability to be able to be involved in a lot of work. A lot of people were still carrying huge amounts of trauma and still had a lot of healing that they didn't [do], because they didn't have access to healing services or anything like that. Coming into the work, I started with the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative, and we partnered with Generation Five, really coming into the work around a clear strategic vision around like...Given how prevalent child sexual abuse is and given how devastating the impacts are in our community...If it really is one in four girls and one in six boys, and those are just estimates, they say. They actually estimate that it's much higher than that, given that most people don't even report child sexual abuse. So if we know that it's probably higher than one in four girls and one in six boys, given the prevalence, given the lasting impacts that it's just had on one person, and then multiplying that by everyone, it's not just about impacts on relationships, which directly impact your community, because in my mind, our communities are going to be what holds our revolutions. There is no good organizer in my mind that's also not doing community building, because they're so connected. Community is like the foundation that organizing gets built upon. A lot of that's misogyny and all thatpatriarchal mess that doesn't get...community building doesn't get recognized as real work but whatever. But given that, the child sexual abuse then becomes a strategic place to do work on, that then becomes a strategic generational place to do work on, because you can literally see how not just child sexual abuse, but intimate violence as well, but particularly child sexual abuse is passed down generation to generation. So strategically going for that hitting that mark, trying to intervene the cycle around child sexual abuse, which is often times the first place where people are being taught or learning about power and control, learning about oppression. We talk about it as the building blocks of oppression, and the building blocks of what normalizes violence later on, normalizes reproductive violence, [and] normalizes all kinds of other forms of violence. That is the first place where people are learning that consent doesn't exist and that their voice does not matter, and [where people are] learning shame about their bodies...all of these themes that reproductive justice really heavily hits on and should hit on in my opinion. Child sexual abuse is also a strategic place for organizing and for all of our movements, because it's not just about this secret thing that gets hidden that happens in people's home. The state uses child sexual abuse, whether it's rape as a weapon of war...we know a lot of those rapes happen to children and young women who are not full-grown women yet, and to boys and to people who are not boys or women, who are intersex whatever. We know that the sex work and the sex trafficking that happens around the militarization, and we know the long history of Native American boarding schools and child sexual abuse being used as a tool for colonization, like all of these things. The State obviously doesn't have...if it's using child sexual abuse, it doesn't have a vested interest in ending it. So I feel like my CSA work actually is a lot about reproductive justice and I bring a lot of my reproductive justice work with me, because I just think they're just so deeply tied, and there's no way...it's impossible to separate intimate violence, and particularly sexual violence, from reproductive justice anyways. But yeah, that's the work that I do now and I feel like that's where my heart really is, because I haven't come across a community where child sexual abuse doesn't exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people don't talk about child sexual abuse. And yet I meet so many Asian women survivors of CSA all the time, who come up to me after I've spoken somewhere or after they read about my work. They don't have anywhere to go. There's no services. Because even those larger services that we were talking about, in that survivor realm, I mean a lot of women of color don't even access those services because of the silence and the added targeting that you're putting your community at risk and your self at risk for, if you come out as a survivor. There's so many pieces to why I feel really passionate around my CSA work, and then the transformative justice piece of it, I feel is just exactly right on the money, because so many of our folks don't report it and don't' seek services because they are scared of what the state will do. They are scared of deportation, they are scare of people being harassed and beaten again or locked up and taken to prison, or because they can't call the cops cause the last time the cops came to their house, they ended up raping them. There's so many things, so it feels like a really natural progression in my mind. I hope that it makes sense in other people's minds.

916	Mingus, Mia	SCAARJ	1980	1980		Asian	Bachelor's degree			2013.0	33	"have you, where people don't have kind of a framework to even put themselves into. And at the same time, the year when I was adopted, my mother along with nine other women, founded the Women's Coalition of St. Croix, and they're a domestic violence organization, and they help victims of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault. One of the founding members is Audre Lorde. So it's through that work [that] there was a profound, really strong, political framework. You know, I grew up in this really close-knit, strong feminist community that was all around this organization, building the organization from the ground up. And so we would have conversations, you know, we'd talk about white supremacy at the dinner table, people knew what homophobia was, you know? There were lesbian couples that were part of our community, who had been together for like twenty years, ten years, and you know, it wasn't like an issue; it was just that's who they were. And so I had like that, but I think that...and then I had this other piece of the political framework that wasn't so much about an analysis around oppressions, but that was also about a deep sense of justice and service and what activism means...and it's weird to even call it activism because so much of it feels like it's just my life's work. You know, it's not like this special thing I do on the side or anything; it's just how you live your life, and what it means to actually mobilize people. So I grew up in that, and I grew up around a lot of...the group that founded the coalition was a very multi-racial group of women of color, White women. I feel like from a young age, I really got a profound sense of, one, just seeing women organizing for themselves, when no one else would, and internalizing into my bones that you don't need a college special course to do activism, you don't need to go to a fancy training, you don't need to know fancy language, or speak the ""right"" way or all these ridiculous things that we're taught now, and that the way that political work I feel like gets professionalized and this elitism around it. I just feel like from growing in that environment, I just saw people just being like, There's a need in our community. We need to do something. How do we create what we need? And it's not perfect, you learn as you go, but they did it, and it's still alive now. And then the other thing I feel like I got from that experience growing up was just this deep profound understanding of violence and how systemic it was and how pervasive it was. And that it wasn't just the five...it wasn't just like my friends who were like experiencing violence, but it was everybody, particularly intimate violence, which is mostly what they worked on, but they worked on intimate violence in the context...like everybody does...of state violence, of all kinds of community violence, of everything. I remember spending Saturday afternoons in the waiting room, playing with kids as their moms went in and out to the counselors. In the early early days, people would spend the night at our house to escape in the middle of the night to fly off the island, because you can't just drive to the next county or anything. I didn't have the language for it, but I knew that it was larger than just a couple of bad people, you know what I mean? It was so many people and so many families, and so many different kinds of families. It wasn't just about poor people, it wasn't about just women of color, it wasn't...None of that mattered. It was all kinds of different folks, and I definitely got a deep sense of the engendered piece of...or I don't know if that's the correct way to say it...but the gender piece of how violence is perpetuated, particularly around women, folks who are identified as female, people who present as feminine, people who present as women, people who are mistaken as women, all of those things felt really profound as well. I don't know that I would've had the fancy words to describe it then, but I know that I also came to a place inside of myself, like something...it's like tectonic plates or something...something just shifted and aligned where I didn't want to just be part of responding to violence, but I really wanted to be a part of making the violence stop. Because even though I knew that the work that my mom's organization did and the work that the women and the people who were in that community did all the time...which ranged from everything from being part of the advocate hotline and going in the middle of the night to assist victims to running the beeper training program to helping to train the police to helping to run the organization to everything, to helping to cook the meals for the meeting. There was collective childcare all the time, because most of the people who were doing the main work were a lot of single mothers. There were a lot of people who didn't have dual income households. There was a lot of death, there were a lot of hard times, and St. Croix has a lot of poverty on it as well. I saw that type of work, and so I knew it was really good work, but I also knew that it wasn't lessening the incidences of violence, and it was helping to create a culture where people could come out about violence and where people could address the consequences of violence and the impact of violence, but [it was] not necessarily doing anything to shift the reasons why violence was happening. And I don't say that with any judgment, because I know and I've seen literally first hand as their organization just continues to grow, and they're still at capacity. Like they literally cannot help all the people who need help, and I think that's true for most of our direct service organizations, who are doing great work on the front lines...and you know, I mean obviously it's never...it's not perfect, and there's a lot of critiques that people have and that I have as well and like I have a lot of respect for those people who are doing work in the trenches and on the front lines because it's not easy work and they often times don't have the support that they need like in terms of...everything from like the constant intake of trauma that they have to the long hours to the little amounts of pay...all that kind of stuff. But I think there was something about that kind of direct and immediate needs work that I saw that I just knew I wanted to be a part of building alternatives and like I said, at the time, I don't think I really had that language, but I feel like that really shaped me in terms of how I understood the rest of my political work."	"have you, where people don't have kind of a framework to even put themselves into. And at the same time, the year when I was adopted, my mother along with nine other women, founded the Women's Coalition of St. Croix, and they're a domestic violence organization, and they help victims of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault. One of the founding members is Audre Lorde. So it's through that work [that] there was a profound, really strong, political framework. You know, I grew up in this really close-knit, strong feminist community that was all around this organization, building the organization from the ground up. And so we would have conversations, you know, we'd talk about white supremacy at the dinner table, people knew what homophobia was, you know? There were lesbian couples that were part of our community, who had been together for like twenty years, ten years, and you know, it wasn't like an issue; it was just that's who they were. And so I had like that, but I think that...and then I had this other piece of the political framework that wasn't so much about an analysis around oppressions, but that was also about a deep sense of justice and service and what activism means...and it's weird to even call it activism because so much of it feels like it's just my life's work. You know, it's not like this special thing I do on the side or anything; it's just how you live your life, and what it means to actually mobilize people. So I grew up in that, and I grew up around a lot of...the group that founded the coalition was a very multi-racial group of women of color, White women. I feel like from a young age, I really got a profound sense of, one, just seeing women organizing for themselves, when no one else would, and internalizing into my bones that you don't need a college special course to do activism, you don't need to go to a fancy training, you don't need to know fancy language, or speak the ""right"" way or all these ridiculous things that we're taught now, and that the way that political work I feel like gets professionalized and this elitism around it. I just feel like from growing in that environment, I just saw people just being like, There's a need in our community. We need to do something. How do we create what we need? And it's not perfect, you learn as you go, but they did it, and it's still alive now. And then the other thing I feel like I got from that experience growing up was just this deep profound understanding of violence and how systemic it was and how pervasive it was. And that it wasn't just the five...it wasn't just like my friends who were like experiencing violence, but it was everybody, particularly intimate violence, which is mostly what they worked on, but they worked on intimate violence in the context...like everybody does...of state violence, of all kinds of community violence, of everything. I remember spending Saturday afternoons in the waiting room, playing with kids as their moms went in and out to the counselors. In the early early days, people would spend the night at our house to escape in the middle of the night to fly off the island, because you can't just drive to the next county or anything. I didn't have the language for it, but I knew that it was larger than just a couple of bad people, you know what I mean? It was so many people and so many families, and so many different kinds of families. It wasn't just about poor people, it wasn't about just women of color, it wasn't...None of that mattered. It was all kinds of different folks, and I definitely got a deep sense of the engendered piece of...or I don't know if that's the correct way to say it...but the gender piece of how violence is perpetuated, particularly around women, folks who are identified as female, people who present as feminine, people who present as women, people who are mistaken as women, all of those things felt really profound as well. I don't know that I would've had the fancy words to describe it then, but I know that I also came to a place inside of myself, like something...it's like tectonic plates or something...something just shifted and aligned where I didn't want to just be part of responding to violence, but I really wanted to be a part of making the violence stop. Because even though I knew that the work that my mom's organization did and the work that the women and the people who were in that community did all the time...which ranged from everything from being part of the advocate hotline and going in the middle of the night to assist victims to running the beeper training program to helping to train the police to helping to run the organization to everything, to helping to cook the meals for the meeting. There was collective childcare all the time, because most of the people who were doing the main work were a lot of single mothers. There were a lot of people who didn't have dual income households. There was a lot of death, there were a lot of hard times, and St. Croix has a lot of poverty on it as well. I saw that type of work, and so I knew it was really good work, but I also knew that it wasn't lessening the incidences of violence, and it was helping to create a culture where people could come out about violence and where people could address the consequences of violence and the impact of violence, but [it was] not necessarily doing anything to shift the reasons why violence was happening. And I don't say that with any judgment, because I know and I've seen literally first hand as their organization just continues to grow, and they're still at capacity. Like they literally cannot help all the people who need help, and I think that's true for most of our direct service organizations, who are doing great work on the front lines...and you know, I mean obviously it's never...it's not perfect, and there's a lot of critiques that people have and that I have as well and like I have a lot of respect for those people who are doing work in the trenches and on the front lines because it's not easy work and they often times don't have the support that they need like in terms of...everything from like the constant intake of trauma that they have to the long hours to the little amounts of pay...all that kind of stuff.

At the time, it was like...it's true in a lot of ways now, there are really just two branches in terms of feminist work that you can do. You can go into pro-choice and reproductive rights, health, or justice work or you can go into anti-violence and domestic violence and sexual assault, rape work. And I had done that [anti-violence] work, so I was like you know, this is the branch of the tree that I'm doing now, and it was great to see...well I had gone with my partner at the time, who's White, and then my two close friends who are both Black women, and it was great to see like women of color there and present, but you know, I think...I didn't really understand and I don't know if everybody else understood what it was for, you know what I mean? What was after the march?	But I remember being excited that I was there, and it felt like something to do.

918	Mingus, Mia	SCAARJ	1980	1980		Asian	Bachelor's degree			2013.0	33	MINGUS: It's a collective. So it's a group of community folks who...I mean, it sounds weird to say we're all volunteers because it's our life's work, so it's not like a volunteer thing, but none of us get paid currently. We have been meeting for two years. Our goal is to create transformative justice responses to child sexual abuse, so responses that don't rely on the State, so people are able to intervene in incidences or cases of child sexual abuse without having to call the police, without having to just send somebody to prison, a response that's not just about resisting violence but also about how do we cultivate and create the world that we want, meaning the things that actually will prevent violence from happening...like safety, healing, accountability, transformation, all those things. And so that's the work that we're doing. Our vision is a Bay Area where everybody has the skills and the capacity to be able to intervene or prevent an act of or an incident of child sexual abuse. And so our work is a lot...It's very different. It's alternatives building work. It's not direct needs or immediate needs work, which tends to be a lot of responding, responding. Our work is...I feel like it's a lot slower and deeper, and so we're working towards supporting our first trial intervention in three years, we'll be doing that. Until then, what we're doing is, currently right now, we are developing a possible accountability model for TJ intervention in CSA. We've been studying accountability models and processes that have already taken place...many of which are not around child sexual abuse, just given the unique risks involved...but seeing what's transferrable and what's not, in terms of interventions that have been successful or where there's pieces of it that have been successful. And so that's one. We'll be having our first draft of that on October 1, which is so exciting. The other big piece is the provider network work that we're doing. So the framework that we're working in is...Given where we're at, and given where we want to be, obviously we want to be where it's like there's healers in every school, there's like accountability circles that are just community run that people do, and everybody knows how to run an accountability process, and you know, people don't even need to be held accountable. They take accountability, right? They do something, they're like, I want to take accountability for this, right? It's not like, You did something wrong. Ever. That's where we want to be, and we know that that's a very long way between where we are and where we want to be. So in the mean time, what is the work going to look like? Obviously, we would love to have just a pure TJ intervention that never relies on the State and is totally community based and funded, whatever, but we know that that's not...We haven't built to the scope and scale that would allow for that yet. We're still a relatively small group of people in terms of how large child sexual abuse is when we think of the statistics, which are one in four girls, and one in six boys. That's huge, right? That number. The other piece that we know is most children are abused by people that they know, that serial child sexual abusers are like less than 2%. Most people are sexually abused by people that they know or are in their intimate networks. So we have like the pervasiveness of CSA that we're like trying to work on and hopefully end it, not just respond to it, and we haven't built to the scope and scale that we want, so how do we leverage what's already here? How do we leverage what's already in place? So the provider network is going to be building a network of providers that we'e able to leverage their services in support of interventions. When we look at the landscape of child sexual abuse, we know that by far, the biggest the most significant gap is around offenders. If we think about survivors, bystanders and offenders, we know that the gap of services for offenders is huge. At least...even if they're not perfect...there's a lot more services for survivors, and there's actually some services, a lot more services for by standers, whether it's like educational groups, support groups, whatever. But when it comes to offenders, it's pretty much like you either get locked up and put in jail, there's a lot of pathologizing and therapeutic stuff, and then there's some smaller more innovative things, but that's the biggest gap, so we know that we want to work there, and then in the meantime, how do we leverage what's already existing? For survivors, how do we sort through those services and find which ones are good? Which are the best support groups? Or which of the support groups are trans* friendly? Which of the support groups are not going to tell on you or report you if you're undocumented? Which of the support groups are held in accessible spaces, right? All of those things. Who is a gynecologist that we could recommend you to or refer you to that you could actually come out as a CSA survivor and they wouldn't be an asshole to you, or that they would know and be competent around some of the impacts that that might mean for not just your medical health but your emotional health as well and have a good bedside manner around that. So in the provider network, it's people who are either aligned with transformative justice, people who are movable, like if there's just one person in the organization, for example, or somebody who's like, Yes, I know, because I'm seeing firsthand how the system doesn't work, I don't...I know we need something different, but I just don't' have enough education, or people who are just the bests in their fields. So we're having our first gathering of that at the end of this week actually, which is super exciting. The other thing that we're doing in that provider network is that we're we just had our first draft of the system maps, which are visual maps for people to be able to see what the different pathways are if you decide to engage the State, or if somebody else...like if your neighbor calls CPS [Child Protective Services] on you. So that you can literally see, Okay, if CPS comes and gets involved, here is what the process looks like. Here is the number of times you'll have to show up in court. Here are the decision makers at each step. Here's what you need to know in terms of if somebody calls 911 vs. CPS. All of that. So that feels really exciting, too, to use as like a tool to educate people but also, again, like knowing that one of the defining characteristics of living with oppression is that you have to make really hard choices, and the choices you have are not choices...I mean you already know the critique of the pro-choice movement...and they're not always just. So we're trying to also figure out how do we work with what we have, knowing that for some people because we haven't built to the scope and scale yet that...We want to be able to hold survivor healing and maybe even accountability, to be able to hold bystander education and maybe accountability and healing here, too, to be able to hold offender transformation, accountability, all of that. We can't hold all of that yet, and we want to get to a place where we can, obviously, so what does it look like in the meantime? So that's the scope of our work right now, which feels exciting. KWON: It's huge. That's a really big vision. MINGUS: Yeah, yeah, but we also think this is...and I remember coming to this realization when I was doing reproductive justice work in Atlanta...that a lot of people were not going to the clinic, not because they didn't have a state issued ID, or because they didn't have anybody to watch their kid in the middle of the day, or because they were scared that [the providers] were going to be queerphobic or transphobic. A lot of people weren't going to seek reproductive health, because they had survived sexual violence and they were like, I just don't deal with anything around any of that. I feel like I really...and so many of the people that I talked to and ended up working with had been survivors of child sexual abuse as well, and that that was just something that was a huge barrier around not only them seeking reproductive health services but also in their ability to be able to be involved in a lot of work. A lot of people were still carrying huge amounts of trauma and still had a lot of healing that they didn't [do], because they didn't have access to healing services or anything like that. Coming into the work, I started with the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative, and we partnered with Generation Five, really coming into the work around a clear strategic vision around like...Given how prevalent child sexual abuse is and given how devastating the impacts are in our community...If it really is one in four girls and one in six boys, and those are just estimates, they say. They actually estimate that it's much higher than that, given that most people don't even report child sexual abuse. So if we know that it's probably higher than one in four girls and one in six boys, given the prevalence, given the lasting impacts that it's just had on one person, and then multiplying that by everyone, it's not just about impacts on relationships, which directly impact your community, because in my mind, our communities are going to be what holds our revolutions. There is no good organizer in my mind that's also not doing community building, because they're so connected. Community is like the foundation that organizing gets built upon. A lot of that's misogyny and all thatpatriarchal mess that doesn't get...community building doesn't get recognized as real work but whatever. But given that, the child sexual abuse then becomes a strategic place to do work on, that then becomes a strategic generational place to do work on, because you can literally see how not just child sexual abuse, but intimate violence as well, but particularly child sexual abuse is passed down generation to generation. So strategically going for that hitting that mark, trying to intervene the cycle around child sexual abuse, which is often times the first place where people are being taught or learning about power and control, learning about oppression. We talk about it as the building blocks of oppression, and the building blocks of what normalizes violence later on, normalizes reproductive violence, [and] normalizes all kinds of other forms of violence. That is the first place where people are learning that consent doesn't exist and that their voice does not matter, and [where people are] learning shame about their bodies...all of these themes that reproductive justice really heavily hits on and should hit on in my opinion. Child sexual abuse is also a strategic place for organizing and for all of our movements, because it's not just about this secret thing that gets hidden that happens in people's home. The state uses child sexual abuse, whether it's rape as a weapon of war...we know a lot of those rapes happen to children and young women who are not full-grown women yet, and to boys and to people who are not boys or women, who are intersex whatever. We know that the sex work and the sex trafficking that happens around the militarization, and we know the long history of Native American boarding schools and child sexual abuse being used as a tool for colonization, like all of these things. The State obviously doesn't have...if it's using child sexual abuse, it doesn't have a vested interest in ending it. So I feel like my CSA work actually is a lot about reproductive justice and I bring a lot of my reproductive justice work with me, because I just think they're just so deeply tied, and there's no way...it's impossible to separate intimate violence, and particularly sexual violence, from reproductive justice anyways. But yeah, that's the work that I do now and I feel like that's where my heart really is, because I haven't come across a community where child sexual abuse doesn't exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people don't talk about child sexual abuse. And yet I meet so many Asian women survivors of CSA all the time, who come up to me after I've spoken somewhere or after they read about my work. They don't have anywhere to go. There's no services. Because even those larger services that we were talking about, in that survivor realm, I mean a lot of women of color don't even access those services because of the silence and the added targeting that you're putting your community at risk and your self at risk for, if you come out as a survivor. There's so many pieces to why I feel really passionate around my CSA work, and then the transformative justice piece of it, I feel is just exactly right on the money, because so many of our folks don't report it and don't' seek services because they are scared of what the state will do. They are scared of deportation, they are scare of people being harassed and beaten again or locked up and taken to prison, or because they can't call the cops cause the last time the cops came to their house, they ended up raping them. There's so many things, so it feels like a really natural progression in my mind. I hope that it makes sense in other people's minds.	MINGUS: It's a collective.

But yeah, that's the work that I do now and I feel like that's where my heart really is, because I haven't come across a community where child sexual abuse doesn't exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people don't talk about child sexual abuse. And yet I meet so many Asian women survivors of CSA all the time, who come up to me after I've spoken somewhere or after they read about my work. They don't have anywhere to go. There's no services. Because even those larger services that we were talking about, in that survivor realm, I mean a lot of women of color don't even access those services because of the silence and the added targeting that you're putting your community at risk and your self at risk for, if you come out as a survivor. There's so many pieces to why I feel really passionate around my CSA work, and then the transformative justice piece of it, I feel is just exactly right on the money, because so many of our folks don't report it and don't' seek services because they are scared of what the state will do. They are scared of deportation, they are scare of people being harassed and beaten again or locked up and taken to prison, or because they can't call the cops cause the last time the cops came to their house, they ended up raping them. There's so many things, so it feels like a really natural progression in my mind. I hope that it makes sense in other people's minds.

So there's the intersection of the content, of course. I began just asking questions, and that's how it all started. They would give statistics around forced sterilization or around abortion or around sexual violence of women of color, or you know, all these different groups, and I would always ask, ""Well, what about disabled women?"" or ""What about disabled people?"" And they never had any statistics."

921	Mingus, Mia	SCAARJ	1980	1980		Asian	Bachelor's degree			2013.0	33	So my work is in two broad pieces. My work is disability justice, so I apply it all the time there, and then I do transformative justice work. So in that work, I feel like...The transformative justice work that I do is around community responses to child sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse is very, very pervasive, and just as the statistics that we're given say that people who are identified or assigned as girls are twice as likely to be victims of child sexual abuse, the same statistics are true around disabled children and adults, because there's also developmental stuff that gets complicated. But actually, in terms of gender, we actually think it's much more...we think it's much higher around people who get assigned as boys, too, but that there's less reporting. So it's hard to know. I feel like my TJ [transformative justice] around child sexual abuse, or CSA, work is disability justice work, because I know so many people who are survivors of child sexual abuse who are disabled people...myself included...and I know so many people who...I know that disabled communities don't talk it. No communities talk about child sexual abuse. So it's not just disabled communities, but given the prevalence, I think that it's something that disabled communities should be talking about and that most disabled children don't have access to community, don't have access...There's just so many more complications around disabled children, I feel like, that get added in around dependency and all that, so I feel like disability justice is certainly a huge piece of that work, too.	How is it relevant now to the work that you do here? MINGUS: So my work is in two broad pieces. My work is disability justice, so I apply it all the time there, and then I do transformative justice work. So in that work, I feel like...The transformative justice work that I do is around community responses to child sexual abuse.

922	Mingus, Mia	SCAARJ	1980	1980		Asian	Bachelor's degree			2013.0	33	organization itself? MINGUS: It's not an organization. KWON: Oh, it's not? MINGUS: It's a collective. So it's a group of community folks who...I mean, it sounds weird to say we're all volunteers because it's our life's work, so it's not like a volunteer thing, but none of us get paid currently. We have been meeting for two years. Our goal is to create transformative justice responses to child sexual abuse, so responses that don't rely on the State, so people are able to intervene in incidences or cases of child sexual abuse without having to call the police, without having to just send somebody to prison, a response that's not just about resisting violence but also about how do we cultivate and create the world that we want, meaning the things that actually will prevent violence from happening...like safety, healing, accountability, transformation, all those things. And so that's the work that we're doing. Our vision is a Bay Area where everybody has the skills and the capacity to be able to intervene or prevent an act of or an incident of child sexual abuse. And so our work is a lot...It's very different. It's alternatives building work. It's not direct needs or immediate needs work, which tends to be a lot of responding, responding. Our work is...I feel like it's a lot slower and deeper, and so we're working towards supporting our first trial intervention in three years, we'll be doing that. Until then, what we're doing is, currently right now, we are developing a possible accountability model for TJ intervention in CSA. We've been studying accountability models and processes that have already taken place...many of which are not around child sexual abuse, just given the unique risks involved...but seeing what's transferrable and what's not, in terms of interventions that have been successful or where there's pieces of it that have been successful. And so that's one. We'll be having our first draft of that on October 1, which is so exciting. The other big piece is the provider network work that we're doing. So the framework that we're working in is...Given where we're at, and given where we want to be, obviously we want to be where it's like there's healers in every school, there's like accountability circles that are just community run that people do, and everybody knows how to run an accountability process, and you know, people don't even need to be held accountable. They take accountability, right? They do something, they're like, I want to take accountability for this, right? It's not like, You did something wrong. Ever. That's where we want to be, and we know that that's a very long way between where we are and where we want to be. So in the mean time, what is the work going to look like? Obviously, we would love to have just a pure TJ intervention that never relies on the State and is totally community based and funded, whatever, but we know that that's not...We haven't built to the scope and scale that would allow for that yet. We're still a relatively small group of people in terms of how large child sexual abuse is when we think of the statistics, which are one in four girls, and one in six boys. That's huge, right? That number. The other piece that we know is most children are abused by people that they know, that serial child sexual abusers are like less than 2%. Most people are sexually abused by people that they know or are in their intimate networks. So we have like the pervasiveness of CSA that we're like trying to work on and hopefully end it, not just respond to it, and we haven't built to the scope and scale that we want, so how do we leverage what's already here? How do we leverage what's already in place? So the provider network is going to be building a network of providers that we'e able to leverage their services in support of interventions. When we look at the landscape of child sexual abuse, we know that by far, the biggest the most significant gap is around offenders. If we think about survivors, bystanders and offenders, we know that the gap of services for offenders is huge. At least...even if they're not perfect...there's a lot more services for survivors, and there's actually some services, a lot more services for by standers, whether it's like educational groups, support groups, whatever. But when it comes to offenders, it's pretty much like you either get locked up and put in jail, there's a lot of pathologizing and therapeutic stuff, and then there's some smaller more innovative things, but that's the biggest gap, so we know that we want to work there, and then in the meantime, how do we leverage what's already existing? For survivors, how do we sort through those services and find which ones are good? Which are the best support groups? Or which of the support groups are trans* friendly? Which of the support groups are not going to tell on you or report you if you're undocumented? Which of the support groups are held in accessible spaces, right? All of those things. Who is a gynecologist that we could recommend you to or refer you to that you could actually come out as a CSA survivor and they wouldn't be an asshole to you, or that they would know and be competent around some of the impacts that that might mean for not just your medical health but your emotional health as well and have a good bedside manner around that. So in the provider network, it's people who are either aligned with transformative justice, people who are movable, like if there's just one person in the organization, for example, or somebody who's like, Yes, I know, because I'm seeing firsthand how the system doesn't work, I don't...I know we need something different, but I just don't' have enough education, or people who are just the bests in their fields. So we're having our first gathering of that at the end of this week actually, which is super exciting. The other thing that we're doing in that provider network is that we're we just had our first draft of the system maps, which are visual maps for people to be able to see what the different pathways are if you decide to engage the State, or if somebody else...like if your neighbor calls CPS [Child Protective Services] on you. So that you can literally see, Okay, if CPS comes and gets involved, here is what the process looks like. Here is the number of times you'll have to show up in court. Here are the decision makers at each step. Here's what you need to know in terms of if somebody calls 911 vs. CPS. All of that. So that feels really exciting, too, to use as like a tool to educate people but also, again, like knowing that one of the defining characteristics of living with oppression is that you have to make really hard choices, and the choices you have are not choices...I mean you already know the critique of the pro-choice movement...and they're not always just. So we're trying to also figure out how do we work with what we have, knowing that for some people because we haven't built to the scope and scale yet that...We want to be able to hold survivor healing and maybe even accountability, to be able to hold bystander education and maybe accountability and healing here, too, to be able to hold offender transformation, accountability, all of that. We can't hold all of that yet, and we want to get to a place where we can, obviously, so what does it look like in the meantime? So that's the scope of our work right now, which feels exciting. KWON: It's huge. That's a really big vision. MINGUS: Yeah, yeah, but we also think this is...and I remember coming to this realization when I was doing reproductive justice work in Atlanta...that a lot of people were not going to the clinic, not because they didn't have a state issued ID, or because they didn't have anybody to watch their kid in the middle of the day, or because they were scared that [the providers] were going to be queerphobic or transphobic. A lot of people weren't going to seek reproductive health, because they had survived sexual violence and they were like, I just don't deal with anything around any of that. I feel like I really...and so many of the people that I talked to and ended up working with had been survivors of child sexual abuse as well, and that that was just something that was a huge barrier around not only them seeking reproductive health services but also in their ability to be able to be involved in a lot of work. A lot of people were still carrying huge amounts of trauma and still had a lot of healing that they didn't [do], because they didn't have access to healing services or anything like that. Coming into the work, I started with the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative, and we partnered with Generation Five, really coming into the work around a clear strategic vision around like...Given how prevalent child sexual abuse is and given how devastating the impacts are in our community...If it really is one in four girls and one in six boys, and those are just estimates, they say. They actually estimate that it's much higher than that, given that most people don't even report child sexual abuse. So if we know that it's probably higher than one in four girls and one in six boys, given the prevalence, given the lasting impacts that it's just had on one person, and then multiplying that by everyone, it's not just about impacts on relationships, which directly impact your community, because in my mind, our communities are going to be what holds our revolutions. There is no good organizer in my mind that's also not doing community building, because they're so connected. Community is like the foundation that organizing gets built upon. A lot of that's misogyny and all thatpatriarchal mess that doesn't get...community building doesn't get recognized as real work but whatever. But given that, the child sexual abuse then becomes a strategic place to do work on, that then becomes a strategic generational place to do work on, because you can literally see how not just child sexual abuse, but intimate violence as well, but particularly child sexual abuse is passed down generation to generation. So strategically going for that hitting that mark, trying to intervene the cycle around child sexual abuse, which is often times the first place where people are being taught or learning about power and control, learning about oppression. We talk about it as the building blocks of oppression, and the building blocks of what normalizes violence later on, normalizes reproductive violence, [and] normalizes all kinds of other forms of violence. That is the first place where people are learning that consent doesn't exist and that their voice does not matter, and [where people are] learning shame about their bodies...all of these themes that reproductive justice really heavily hits on and should hit on in my opinion. Child sexual abuse is also a strategic place for organizing and for all of our movements, because it's not just about this secret thing that gets hidden that happens in people's home. The state uses child sexual abuse, whether it's rape as a weapon of war...we know a lot of those rapes happen to children and young women who are not full-grown women yet, and to boys and to people who are not boys or women, who are intersex whatever. We know that the sex work and the sex trafficking that happens around the militarization, and we know the long history of Native American boarding schools and child sexual abuse being used as a tool for colonization, like all of these things. The State obviously doesn't have...if it's using child sexual abuse, it doesn't have a vested interest in ending it. So I feel like my CSA work actually is a lot about reproductive justice and I bring a lot of my reproductive justice work with me, because I just think they're just so deeply tied, and there's no way...it's impossible to separate intimate violence, and particularly sexual violence, from reproductive justice anyways. But yeah, that's the work that I do now and I feel like that's where my heart really is, because I haven't come across a community where child sexual abuse doesn't exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people don't talk about child sexual abuse.

931	Mingus, Mia	SCAARJ	1980	1980		Asian	Bachelor's degree			2013.0	33	MINGUS: It's not an organization. KWON: Oh, it's not? MINGUS: It's a collective. So it's a group of community folks who...I mean, it sounds weird to say we're all volunteers because it's our life's work, so it's not like a volunteer thing, but none of us get paid currently. We have been meeting for two years. Our goal is to create transformative justice responses to child sexual abuse, so responses that don't rely on the State, so people are able to intervene in incidences or cases of child sexual abuse without having to call the police, without having to just send somebody to prison, a response that's not just about resisting violence but also about how do we cultivate and create the world that we want, meaning the things that actually will prevent violence from happening...like safety, healing, accountability, transformation, all those things. And so that's the work that we're doing. Our vision is a Bay Area where everybody has the skills and the capacity to be able to intervene or prevent an act of or an incident of child sexual abuse. And so our work is a lot...It's very different. It's alternatives building work. It's not direct needs or immediate needs work, which tends to be a lot of responding, responding. Our work is...I feel like it's a lot slower and deeper, and so we're working towards supporting our first trial intervention in three years, we'll be doing that. Until then, what we're doing is, currently right now, we are developing a possible accountability model for TJ intervention in CSA. We've been studying accountability models and processes that have already taken place...many of which are not around child sexual abuse, just given the unique risks involved...but seeing what's transferrable and what's not, in terms of interventions that have been successful or where there's pieces of it that have been successful. And so that's one. We'll be having our first draft of that on October 1, which is so exciting. The other big piece is the provider network work that we're doing. So the framework that we're working in is...Given where we're at, and given where we want to be, obviously we want to be where it's like there's healers in every school, there's like accountability circles that are just community run that people do, and everybody knows how to run an accountability process, and you know, people don't even need to be held accountable. They take accountability, right? They do something, they're like, I want to take accountability for this, right? It's not like, You did something wrong. Ever. That's where we want to be, and we know that that's a very long way between where we are and where we want to be. So in the mean time, what is the work going to look like? Obviously, we would love to have just a pure TJ intervention that never relies on the State and is totally community based and funded, whatever, but we know that that's not...We haven't built to the scope and scale that would allow for that yet. We're still a relatively small group of people in terms of how large child sexual abuse is when we think of the statistics, which are one in four girls, and one in six boys. That's huge, right? That number. The other piece that we know is most children are abused by people that they know, that serial child sexual abusers are like less than 2%. Most people are sexually abused by people that they know or are in their intimate networks. So we have like the pervasiveness of CSA that we're like trying to work on and hopefully end it, not just respond to it, and we haven't built to the scope and scale that we want, so how do we leverage what's already here? How do we leverage what's already in place? So the provider network is going to be building a network of providers that we'e able to leverage their services in support of interventions. When we look at the landscape of child sexual abuse, we know that by far, the biggest the most significant gap is around offenders. If we think about survivors, bystanders and offenders, we know that the gap of services for offenders is huge. At least...even if they're not perfect...there's a lot more services for survivors, and there's actually some services, a lot more services for by standers, whether it's like educational groups, support groups, whatever. But when it comes to offenders, it's pretty much like you either get locked up and put in jail, there's a lot of pathologizing and therapeutic stuff, and then there's some smaller more innovative things, but that's the biggest gap, so we know that we want to work there, and then in the meantime, how do we leverage what's already existing? For survivors, how do we sort through those services and find which ones are good? Which are the best support groups? Or which of the support groups are trans* friendly? Which of the support groups are not going to tell on you or report you if you're undocumented? Which of the support groups are held in accessible spaces, right? All of those things. Who is a gynecologist that we could recommend you to or refer you to that you could actually come out as a CSA survivor and they wouldn't be an asshole to you, or that they would know and be competent around some of the impacts that that might mean for not just your medical health but your emotional health as well and have a good bedside manner around that. So in the provider network, it's people who are either aligned with transformative justice, people who are movable, like if there's just one person in the organization, for example, or somebody who's like, Yes, I know, because I'm seeing firsthand how the system doesn't work, I don't...I know we need something different, but I just don't' have enough education, or people who are just the bests in their fields. So we're having our first gathering of that at the end of this week actually, which is super exciting. The other thing that we're doing in that provider network is that we're we just had our first draft of the system maps, which are visual maps for people to be able to see what the different pathways are if you decide to engage the State, or if somebody else...like if your neighbor calls CPS [Child Protective Services] on you. So that you can literally see, Okay, if CPS comes and gets involved, here is what the process looks like. Here is the number of times you'll have to show up in court. Here are the decision makers at each step. Here's what you need to know in terms of if somebody calls 911 vs. CPS. All of that. So that feels really exciting, too, to use as like a tool to educate people but also, again, like knowing that one of the defining characteristics of living with oppression is that you have to make really hard choices, and the choices you have are not choices...I mean you already know the critique of the pro-choice movement...and they're not always just. So we're trying to also figure out how do we work with what we have, knowing that for some people because we haven't built to the scope and scale yet that...We want to be able to hold survivor healing and maybe even accountability, to be able to hold bystander education and maybe accountability and healing here, too, to be able to hold offender transformation, accountability, all of that. We can't hold all of that yet, and we want to get to a place where we can, obviously, so what does it look like in the meantime? So that's the scope of our work right now, which feels exciting. KWON: It's huge. That's a really big vision. MINGUS: Yeah, yeah, but we also think this is...and I remember coming to this realization when I was doing reproductive justice work in Atlanta...that a lot of people were not going to the clinic, not because they didn't have a state issued ID, or because they didn't have anybody to watch their kid in the middle of the day, or because they were scared that [the providers] were going to be queerphobic or transphobic. A lot of people weren't going to seek reproductive health, because they had survived sexual violence and they were like, I just don't deal with anything around any of that. I feel like I really...and so many of the people that I talked to and ended up working with had been survivors of child sexual abuse as well, and that that was just something that was a huge barrier around not only them seeking reproductive health services but also in their ability to be able to be involved in a lot of work. A lot of people were still carrying huge amounts of trauma and still had a lot of healing that they didn't [do], because they didn't have access to healing services or anything like that. Coming into the work, I started with the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative, and we partnered with Generation Five, really coming into the work around a clear strategic vision around like...Given how prevalent child sexual abuse is and given how devastating the impacts are in our community...If it really is one in four girls and one in six boys, and those are just estimates, they say. They actually estimate that it's much higher than that, given that most people don't even report child sexual abuse. So if we know that it's probably higher than one in four girls and one in six boys, given the prevalence, given the lasting impacts that it's just had on one person, and then multiplying that by everyone, it's not just about impacts on relationships, which directly impact your community, because in my mind, our communities are going to be what holds our revolutions. There is no good organizer in my mind that's also not doing community building, because they're so connected. Community is like the foundation that organizing gets built upon. A lot of that's misogyny and all thatpatriarchal mess that doesn't get...community building doesn't get recognized as real work but whatever. But given that, the child sexual abuse then becomes a strategic place to do work on, that then becomes a strategic generational place to do work on, because you can literally see how not just child sexual abuse, but intimate violence as well, but particularly child sexual abuse is passed down generation to generation. So strategically going for that hitting that mark, trying to intervene the cycle around child sexual abuse, which is often times the first place where people are being taught or learning about power and control, learning about oppression. We talk about it as the building blocks of oppression, and the building blocks of what normalizes violence later on, normalizes reproductive violence, [and] normalizes all kinds of other forms of violence. That is the first place where people are learning that consent doesn't exist and that their voice does not matter, and [where people are] learning shame about their bodies...all of these themes that reproductive justice really heavily hits on and should hit on in my opinion. Child sexual abuse is also a strategic place for organizing and for all of our movements, because it's not just about this secret thing that gets hidden that happens in people's home. The state uses child sexual abuse, whether it's rape as a weapon of war...we know a lot of those rapes happen to children and young women who are not full-grown women yet, and to boys and to people who are not boys or women, who are intersex whatever. We know that the sex work and the sex trafficking that happens around the militarization, and we know the long history of Native American boarding schools and child sexual abuse being used as a tool for colonization, like all of these things. The State obviously doesn't have...if it's using child sexual abuse, it doesn't have a vested interest in ending it. So I feel like my CSA work actually is a lot about reproductive justice and I bring a lot of my reproductive justice work with me, because I just think they're just so deeply tied, and there's no way...it's impossible to separate intimate violence, and particularly sexual violence, from reproductive justice anyways. But yeah, that's the work that I do now and I feel like that's where my heart really is, because I haven't come across a community where child sexual abuse doesn't exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people don't talk about child sexual abuse. And yet I meet so many Asian women survivors of CSA all the time, who come up to me after I've spoken somewhere or after they read about my work. They don't have anywhere to go. There's no services. Because even those larger services that we were talking about, in that survivor realm, I mean a lot of women of color don't even access those services because of the silence and the added targeting that you're putting your community at risk and your self at risk for, if you come out as a survivor. There's so many pieces to why I feel really passionate around my CSA work, and then the transformative justice piece of it, I feel is just exactly right on the money, because so many of our folks don't report it and don't' seek services because they are scared of what the state will do. They are scared of deportation, they are scare of people being harassed and beaten again or locked up and taken to prison, or because they can't call the cops cause the last time the cops came to their house, they ended up raping them. There's so many things, so it feels like a really natural progression in my mind. I hope that it makes sense in other people's minds.	MINGUS: It's not an organization. KWON: Oh, it's not?

And we asked, Why is it that the hate crimes are towards men? And actually after some digging, we found two Asian names, Asian women, Asian girls. A girl who was found hanging from a tree. She was eight years old or quite young, found raped hanging from a tree, right after Penthouse Magazine had this thing about exotic pornography about Asian women, including a picture of one hanging from a tree. They were all photos of being dead. So who knows about the connection? There was a Japanese American woman who was shot in her kitchen from outside on December 7, Pearl Harbor Day. There were women who were targeted, sexually assaulted, and so we had to prove that it's not that there weren't hate crimes against Asian women, they just weren't called hate crimes. The violence was also mixed with gender violence, and because of that, they were shunted off to a sex crimes unit. We all know that women and crimes against women are secondary crimes, they're not really taken seriously anyway, and so they disappeared. So these Asian American women victims of real serial rapists, who specifically targeted Asian women, serial killers... So anyway, so that was where we got together, we had a little study group, and we wrote the paper for Making Waves, ""Where are the Asian women?"" So the thing about, How do we consciously bring gender into it and to ask, Where are the women? It's not like all these activists, all over the country didn't know this list. We had all known this list, but it really took some Asian American women, Asian American feminists, to say, Well, wait a minute. Look at the pattern here. Where are the women? And no one thought to ask where are the women? How does this...It's not like racism first and sexism later. It's like we have to actively, consciously, always look for the Asian women. Just like we need to look for the Asian Americans. If we don't look for them, we'll be disappeared too. But also within our Asian American stuff, we have to look and say, Where are the Asian American women?

There's a national group in Washington, L.A., San Francisco, and Washington...state of Washington. So there were all these different advocacy groups...Texas...where people ...Ohio...they were just groups that wanted to do something, and we began tracking. So we began tracking incidents of Anti-Asian violence and so things would come up, and they were various cases that were reported. Terrible cases of teenagers who were stabbed to death, five second graders in Stockton, California who were gunned down in their school playground by a white supremacist, cases that would come up all that time. And we started tracking them because there was no...there was nobody else doing it, so we started doing it. I got to the point where I probably had a list of fifty or a hundred, and it spanned every ethnicity; nobody was free of the violence. So this was the 80s, in the 1980s there were...I could recite them by [heart]. I mean, I would talk about them. I knew every word of them. And at a certain point, where I would talk about them... And every one of these were men. We have 50 or 100 names of incidents we're tracking. What did that mean? Why are they all men? Why are they all male...except for the five children. I think there were some girls in there. But ones where they were specifically targeted to be bludgeoned to death or something. Most of the cases were men, and we knew their names. And so out of that there were other women, especially here in San Francisco, who was doing work around violence against women. And we asked, Why is it that the hate crimes are towards men? And actually after some digging, we found two Asian names, Asian women, Asian girls. A girl who was found hanging from a tree. She was eight years old or quite young, found raped hanging from a tree, right after Penthouse Magazine had this thing about exotic pornography about Asian women, including a picture of one hanging from a tree. They were all photos of being dead. So who knows about the connection? There was a Japanese American woman who was shot in her kitchen from outside on December 7, Pearl Harbor Day. There were women who were targeted, sexually assaulted, and so we had to prove that it's not that there weren't hate crimes against Asian women, they just weren't called hate crimes. The violence was also mixed with gender violence, and because of that, they were shunted off to a sex crimes unit. We all know that women and crimes against women are secondary crimes, they're not really taken seriously anyway, and so they disappeared. So these Asian American women victims of real serial rapists, who specifically targeted Asian women, serial killers... So anyway, so that was where we got together, we had a little study group, and we wrote the paper for Making Waves, ""Where are the Asian women?"" So the thing about, How do we consciously bring gender into it and to ask, Where are the women? It's not like all these activists, all over the country didn't know this list. We had all known this list, but it really took some Asian American women, Asian American feminists, to say, Well, wait a minute. Look at the pattern here. Where are the women? And no one thought to ask where are the women? How does this...It's not like racism first and sexism later. It's like we have to actively, consciously, always look for the Asian women. Just like we need to look for the Asian Americans. If we don't look for them, we'll be disappeared too.

If we were silent, people would assume that it's because we had no problem with it. If you're silent, it's like the campaign in the beginning against homophobia with HIV and AIDS. Silence equals death. Silence equals death in the LGBT movement, but it also means death to our communities. If we're silent, it's okay for people to kills us. If we're silent, it's okay for kids to get bullied in school, Asian kids, because they're...or Asian American women to be targets of sexual harassment or sexual violence, because we're perceived as being passive and not fighting back	A lot of Asian American parents are sort of like, Oh, Why'd you stick your neck out? You're really going to get...you'll be the nail that sticks out, then you'll get hammered down. You'll bring trouble to yourself and to your family. And you know, that's not really the way it works. It's really the more you speak up, the more possibility [you have] for making a difference, for making a change, instead of suffering in silence.

I mean, all of those things are...We have to speak up. Nothing gets done unless you speak up, whether it's in America or anywhere else. So anyway, to me, that's the lesson I learned there that I think is important for especially for young activists.
935	Zia, Helen	SCAARJ	1952	1950	NJ	Asian	Graduate or professional degree			2013.0	61	We have to talk about what it means for Asian American women and bring gender into this, too, because this last wave of migration, worldwide migration of people who have been displaced, was largely a female migration. Women who were dispossessed. And that brings a whole other layer of vulnerability that women have to violence, to less power, to sexual violence, to the need to care for children and parents and because women as caregivers in society, too.	. So dealing with immigration for Asian Americans has a lot of layers to it. So I think this is big, and as far as the visibility, what it means is, for Asian Americans, we have to make sure we're seen. We have to make sure we're heard. We have to talk about it. We have to talk about what it means for Asian American women and bring gender into this, too, because this last wave of migration, worldwide migration of people who have been displaced, was largely a female migration. Women who were dispossessed. And that brings a whole other layer of vulnerability that women have to violence, to less power, to sexual violence, to the need to care for children and parents and because women as caregivers in society, too. So anyway, I would say that that is for now, a huge one.

939	Ahrens, Lois	SCAL	1947	1940	NY	White	Some college	Married (except if separated)		2008.0	61	We organized like, a feminist counseling service out of those different kinds of services and consciousness raising groups and I mean there was just a lot of activity with many, many, many hundreds of women ... all kinds of women ... who were involved in it. All kinds of women and all kinds of points of view that were constantly ...sometimes were working together, sometimes were arguing with each other. I remember someone brought in a copy of Ms. magazine and on the cover of Ms. magazine was this picture of this woman with a black eye and it was first time anybody actually talked about violence against women in that way. There was talk about rape, but not about battery and the person oddly, coincidently, weirdly enough that wrote that article was Del Martin, the same person that started the D.O.B. It's very weird. And so she started the Daughters of Bilitis in like the 1950s and she ended up writing this book called Battered Women and there was this cover of Ms. magazine an article that she wrote. We all started talking about it ... a whole group of us got together ... and we thought we should just keep talking about it and keep talking about it and we did and eventually we decided we'd start a battered women's shelter. At the time there was a battered women's shelter in England, in London. There was a battered women's shelter in Minneapolis. And there was a battered women's shelter in San Francisco. I think there might have been something or other in Boston and that was it for the country. So, we basically just made it up. I mean, we did a lot of reading. We did a lot of talking and we started announcing that we were starting to work on this. And all these women whose mother had been beaten up, whose sisters or themselves just started sort of coming to these meetings and started telling us what was going on. So, we opened this shelter for battered women ... it's called the Center for Battered Women ... it still exists ... and there were three staff members at the time and I was one of them. We started this shelter which started small and now unfortunately, I think is now the biggest shelter I think in the country. It's like just huge, humongous and it's not a good thing, I don't think. So, I did that ...I mean, there was a very long lead up to it, of course, I mean because we had figure out what the hell was going on and we had to train ourselves to do this work. Then over a period of a couple of years the shelter grew and we raised money. Over a period of years what happened was basically ... and this had happened to the rape crisis movement too ... it was changing from a movement into a social service and there were sort of competing ideologies. We always thought that you couldn't stop battery without questioning patriarchy ... that's the language of the times ... and so, you know, a lot of what I did even when I was doing all of this direct service work was, I would go out and I would talk to all of these women ... you know, women who were in WIC programs, women who were getting welfare about what was going on and have political conversations, talk about our services but have political conversations.

Maybe in Los Angeles city jails, where the, where maybe a lot of the guards a Latino, you know, maybe, but if you go into actual prisons, what you see is White people keeping Black people or people of color in cages.

Power, I mean in the most gross form, goes on every single minute of the day. Every single minute of the day.

And so that's the whole point of the Clothesline Project is to be out and in public and to be visible. And so it was difficult to respond to because it was coming from a fellow survivor. There was compassion and we had done everything that we thought that we could do. We had a table that was always staffed right out in the Clothesline Project.

So as the Board of AWARE we wrote an editorial to the Sophian in response and also put something up on the Daily Jolt which was then just trolled again because that's what happens. But we did also send that to the Sophian and it was published in the newspaper. And then somebody also got upset because the ... I think this might have been my junior year or my senior year.

Somebody who was not a survivor who was trying to speak for all the survivors in her life wrote another editorial to the Sophian.

MCNULTY: We didn't talk about it very much. There was a lot of what has since been labeled date rape going on. Just really ugly stuff. Now, maybe, because when I was in college here, the drinking age was eighteen. So you'd have college boys ... young men ... coming in for the house parties. And there was just no control over drinking, at all. Everybody was of age, but there were no drink limits, no drink tickets. It was just a beer bathtub; everyone just completely getting drunk. And so, there were a lot of unpleasant situations at best, and I think a lot of what we would call now rape situations. And I know I came home one night from a party in the quad, and a group of very drunk men followed me. And I had made one of them angry at a dance, because I refused to dance with him. I said I'd rather dance with my girlfriends. And I was probably not very nice when I said it. And they followed me home, and they tried to follow me into the house and attack me. And it was only because one of them ... I don't know who it was, but he reached out, and he pulled the door closed, so they were all outside, and I was locked inside. But that was not uncommon. GOLDMAN: And the administration... MCNULTY: I did call security, but not till the next morning. I was so scared, I spent part of the night ... we used to have phone booths on the first floor of the houses, so I just huddled down in the phone booth. And I called my aunt and uncle, who lived in New Haven, and said, ""Can I come see you right away?"" So I left campus. And then I notified security, and of course, what are they going to do at that point? They were long gone. And they were very ... security was nice; sympathetic. But they couldn't do anything at that point. But I don't think I told anybody that happened. I was ashamed of myself. Why? I don't know. GOLDMAN: Not an uncommon [feeling?]. MCNULTY: No, it's not. I understand that. GOLDMAN: Yeah. Yeah, so the administration hadn't set up any... MCNULTY: No. GOLDMAN: ...ways of dealing with that? MCNULTY: Probably they would have offered me counseling or something, and informed other students. There was no reporting to other students when there was an incident on campus. Nobody was notified."	"MCNULTY: Hm, let me think. GOLDMAN: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) MCNULTY: Politically. There was some organizing around sexual violence. The party line of the college at the time was that there was no rape on campus or there was no sexual violence here, which, based on my own experience, and that of my friends, I knew was complete bullshit. So there was some ... sorry ... agitation about improving campus security. And they did make some changes, like put up ... we had blue boxes. You know, every half-mile, there was a blue box, just in case when you got attacked, you were right next to a blue box. But I think that was about it. I can't remember anything else, at the time.

997	Acey, Katherine	SCVF	1950	1950	NY	Other Race	Bachelor's degree			2007.0	57	"I'm trying to think. I think that I was a senior and she was a junior. I think I mentioned, my sister and I have lived in the same city, in very close proximity, for all of our lives, except for about two years when she was in graduate school out in Texas and Arizona. Rosary Hill was, as I said, in the suburbs, and there was no transportation. The buses ran, but they stopped at a certain hour. Buses didn't even run, I don't think, on the weekends. So the college culture in Buffalo ... not just at Rosary Hill, and probably in the United States, I would imagine ... was you hitchhiked. I remember hitchhiking from Buffalo to Albany to go see somebody. You know, we were hitchhiking together. My first years, before I moved off campus, I had a job off campus, and I would hitchhike to that job, and once a guy exposed himself. I used to carry a knife actually, but I don't know what I thought I was going to do with it. ANDERSON: But you still didn't think you were gay? (laughter) ACEY: It had a nice little leather holder. ANDERSON: Yes, I was going to say. ACEY: I forgot about that too. God, you know, the things that come back to you are amazing. So it was a culture of hitchhiking, and people were careful. I eventually stopped hitchhiking by myself. I didn't think it was such a cool, you know ... But sometimes you just got desperate though, you had to get someplace. Nobody had the money to have cabs, and it wasn't like New York where you just, you know, put your hand out. My sister and her roommate were going out for the evening to a bar, and they left campus and they hitchhiked. They got picked up by two guys, who drove them near where they were going, but pulled into the driveway at the state hospital, which is this big ... massive acres and trees and deserted and dark ... you know, long driveway. My sister and her roommate were in the back seat of a two-door car, and when they went to let them out, her roommate got out, they pushed her, and they drove off. Her roommate got hysterical and called the police when she got somewhere ... I can't remember ... and got some help. I worked my way through college. I mean, I had some scholarships and my parents helped me, but I always held down a job. I don't know how I did that. I used to take a lot of classes, be involved in politics, and work. I just don't know how that all happened but it did. I was probably a crazy person then too. ANDERSON: Yeah, it was the pace that you set a long time ago that you still have. ACEY: I was running the student union that night and there was a dance. I got a call to come to the police station. I was with these close women friends, and I didn't have a jacket, it was chilly. My friend gave me her leather jacket and said, ""Wear this."" And I went off, and I got to the police station and found out what had happened to my sister. She'd been beaten and raped. She'd been found in a park. There was an alert out, that she was in a park that was closed, with these guys, and the police were just doing a routine run-by of the park, and they saw this car and they investigated. So my sister was traumatized. There was a woman police officer talking to her and then to me. The guys who had done this were African American, and the police were saying some really outrageous ... So it was this, really, another one of those conflict-ridden, contradictory situations where both she, who is, like, bruised and beaten ... She was a virgin. She might have been a sophomore or a freshman. I don't know, (inaudible) personal history, anyway. So we got into an argument with the police officer, who had begun to make some racist statements, and I made the comment that, ""How can you say this? I was with friends, this jacket belongs to my friend."" So I just said to them, ""Let's just leave this, let's just get out,"" because she had to get to the hospital, get all these tests. We're talking late '60s, maybe 1970s. I can't remember if I was of legal age, because I am a year older, but we basically didn't want my parents to know what happened to my sister, because we felt it would kill them, knowing that she'd been raped and brutally beaten. To this day we don't know. There were all kinds of knives and axes in the car, so we don't know if they intended to kill ... ANDERSON: So you were trying to protect your parents from the pain of that. ACEY: We were trying to protect my parents, which was, you know, probably the very wrong thing to do. And then within days, my mother and my aunt were coming to visit, and now this became a big thing. There was a big newspaper article that someone had been raped from campus. Nobody knew, so there was all this buzz on the campus. My sister is not in a great shape, we're trying to keep this from our parents. My aunt and mother arrive, and we go out and do something and we come back to my sister's room, and she's on the phone sobbing. What the police had done is to call my father and told him that his daughter was brutally beaten and raped, and his other daughter ... they made up some kind of story, and I can't remember. Again, I'd have to ask my sister exactly how it went, but they got in that his other daughter ... they got in the leather jacket and all that, but they kind of made it something else. ANDERSON: And African American friends too. ACEY: Yeah, they kind of made it an ugly story rather than how it was. So then here we are, my mother and Anna want to know what's happened and why was my sister crying. So that was like completely ... And Joanne, well, she had to go through three trials. She already had left Buffalo and gone off to graduate school, and they were flying her back. I think the first trial was a hung jury, and the second trial they were convicted, but then they got off on a technicality, an appeal. And then there was a third trial, at which they were, in fact, convicted. One, I think, ended up serving a few months, the other a year. So, ah, it was, you know, a big thing. I think I went through a lot of denial, you know? ANDERSON: Yeah. ACEY: A number of years later, I began to be more in touch with the feelings about it. Now I ... you know, fast forward ... I have become involved in the women's movement, through reproductive rights and sterilization abuse work, and then anti-sterilization abuse, and also antiviolence, women's antiviolence work, mostly around sexual assault and rape, but also somewhat around battered women. They were different organizations at that time, but the women who were doing the antiviolence work were very connected. Some are involved in both. So it was years later that I got more connected to what had happened, because I think I went into a very ... denial: [it] happened, [it's] over. You know, I felt like my sister needed to get some help. Initially she did a little counseling, but she really never, I don't feel ... The resources weren't there. She was treated terribly by the defense attorneys, treated terribly by the medical folks. There was no one place that I feel she got what she needed, and I think even from me. My parents were devastated, but again, there wasn't a lot of discussion about it. So years later I got more in touch with what had happened, kind
of the hugeness of it. ANDERSON: Through the movement or through other personal work or therapy? ACEY: In working within the women's antiviolence movement. By the time I got involved with it, there were many lesbians, women of color. It was about organizing and advocacy but also services, but it was also about personal. So the more exposed I got to people working, but also women who had experienced some violence, the closer it got me to, like, begin to get better in touch and to begin to take in that experience in a whole different way. I remember distinctly one conference where there was a session that was women of color only, to talk personally. The opening question was, We're going to go around the room, and I want each person to ... if they can ... relate an experience of their own or of someone close to them or one they know. I remember there might have been about 40 women in the room. Every single woman had a story, and I was totally overwhelmed by it. Again, this is years later. We're maybe talking at least ten years later, if not more ... probably more ... since my sister's rape. I just remember just sobbing and sobbing, and then I started to talk a little more to my sister. Well, now we're talking, you know, well over 30 years ago. It still feels like it didn't get completely processed, if you will, so."	"ACEY: I'm trying to think. I think that I was a senior and she was a junior.

We're maybe talking at least ten years later, if not more ... probably more ... since my sister's rape. I just remember just sobbing and sobbing, and then I started to talk a little more to my sister. Well, now we're talking, you know, well over 30 years ago. It still feels like it didn't get completely processed, if you will, so."

At first I got involved in CARASA [Coalition for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse], and then I got involved with New York Women Against Rape. You know, besides the student politics, there was a group of us that started a journal called Catalyst: A Socialist Journal of the Social Services. And I think we changed it to the Human Services. So that was one piece of work. I did a lot of other pieces of organizing, kind of in and out ... Farm workers. Later on ... I was already out of school ... but anti-apartheid. I kind of was touching down in different places. Kind of Catalyst was an anchor of doing some work. I did a lot of different study groups ... feminist study groups, political economy. I loved the study group thing because you kind of, like, read and talk to people, sharpen ... ANDERSON: Did you do more study groups than c.r. [consciousness-raising] groups? ACEY: There were more study groups than c.r. groups, but I did some c.r. groups with different groupings of people. So a couple of c.r. groups, and then there was one c.r. group which was kind of a c.r. group but really, we read, we socialized, we did c.r. It kind of was more of a blend, and that pretty much ... you know, into the '70s and right into the '80s, quite a bit of that. Some of my groups were really small, not the political economy. One group ... there was five of us, and we worked with a mentor to really read all of Marx. Another group was a feminist. We looked at the movement, we read articles, books, had discussions, potlucks. Another group was more like a feminist support group, and was the political kind. So there was always at least one going on, if not two, for a number of years, and they kind of stretched out. Then I got very involved in New York Women Against Rape.

Trouble was happening, and she was out of the house and called me. And I, for a moment, foolishly thought, I can ask these people for help. Which is stupid and I should have known better. Instead, their response was this wave ... As soon as I began to hint at the full dimensions of what the problem was ... which is, essentially, that my stepfather was after my little sister ... they panicked. The mental health people there really didn't know how to deal with it. And so their response was that I was hysterical and that that meant I was not necessarily a good scholarship student. I had been sobbing, and I'm sitting with this woman, and I remember that it suddenly hit me: You're not like these people. Shut up, wipe your face, and get out of here. And cleaning it up as best I could. When I went to the women's meeting, I had the same response: These people can afford to talk about this stuff, but I could lose my scholarship and be on the street.

Oh, it was the counseling department. My sister had called me. My little sister was ... Trouble was happening, and she was out of the house and called me. And I, for a moment, foolishly thought, I can ask these people for help. Which is stupid and I should have known better. Instead, their response was this wave ... As soon as I began to hint at the full dimensions of what the problem was ... which is, essentially, that my stepfather was after my little sister ... they panicked. The mental health people there really didn't know how to deal with it. And so their response was that I was hysterical and that that meant I was not necessarily a good scholarship student. I had been sobbing, and I'm sitting with this woman, and I remember that it suddenly hit me: You're not like these people. Shut up, wipe your face, and get out of here. And cleaning it up as best I could. When I went to the women's meeting, I had the same response: These people can afford to talk about this stuff, but I could lose my scholarship and be on the street. So I walked out, then didn't go back.

(laughs) ""I don't know that she really wants to be tied up in that way, Jean. You're just talking her into doing this because there are all these people watching and you're showing off, and she looks decidedly uncomfortable in a way she doesn't enjoy."" You know, having to be that person is a pain in the ass. ANDERSON: That was your job? ALLISON: That was one of my jobs. ANDERSON: To monitor that. ALLISON: We had different people who did it. We had dungeon masters or party monitors who would act that way. It's really profoundly complicated to have a feminist sex party. (laughs) Some of it is simple. You make sure there's food, you watch the consumption of liquor. You make sure there are no drugs, because then you get busted. You make sure there are no people underage, because then you get busted. You make sure nobody's got a camera, because then people can get blackmailed. And you watched ... you have certain rules for how parties proceed, which means you can ... There are people who have the right, at any point, to step up and say, You really want this, honey? And intervene, but do it in a graceful manner. I brought Southern manners to sex parties in New York."

But suddenly there was money available from the government, and they could write a proposal, and they had an institution that looked really good and socially respectable, much more so than our lesbian, fly-by-night camp that put the thing in place in the first place, and they took it over. The same thing happened with a lot of the rape crisis stuff. So a lot of things that we developed, we ... feminist activists ... created, got taken over by much more conservative, socially acceptable, heterosexual organizations. It was just so relentless. Pretty depressing. ANDERSON: Yeah, and then it became the service industry and the social change movement. ALLISON: Exactly. And there was this constant struggle about whether it was radical or whether it was reform. ANDERSON: Right. ALLISON: Some of that is coded ... I always thought ... was a coded argument, because the real argument is ... (chuckles) ... the real argument was, who was career making and who was trying to change the world? And, you know, both can happen at the same time. A lot of these organizations became conservative because people were career making and they couldn't risk their careers, so they had to keep their respectability quotient. So they couldn't do real radical stuff. It's like, right back to the waitress union. You know, they'll let you do a whole lot of things that look radical, but when you actually begin to deal with genuine economic issues, they'll shut you right down. Or you'll suddenly be in danger in ways you haven't been before, which is some of what happened in the rape crisis and shelter movement in D.C. At the same time, there was a rape crisis center that survived in D.C., that was radical and that fought tooth and nail for that funding, and actually got a lot of it, and I worked with them for a while too.

I had a childhood that outside the little, you know, my-my ... my immediate family was terrific. It was full of imagination and games and the kind of intrigue and fun you have when-when you imagine and you go to the movies on Saturday and you ... you know, you sit with all the kids and you get in trouble with the matron. I mean, these are just wonderful memories that I have. Um, there was a darkness in my life. I was sexually abused by a relative, um, when I was very young, and I've never mentioned it to my family. My family knows nothing at all about it. And that ... I think that does things to a child that somehow takes the wonder off things, that it tarnishes trust in a way that ... that you can still smile and run around and have a good time and fun but there's just a little bit something that happens and it's not good. It's ... whether it's guilt or because I think you always feel like somehow responsible even though you're 9 or 10 years old and this is an adult, um, but it's a very tragic thing, and it's ... although I don't believe in the death penalty, it's left me so angry that I would never be willing to sit on a jury in a sex abuse case because I know I couldn't be reasonable about it. I couldn't weigh with any measure because of my own feelings. ANDERSON: Did this go on into high school? APUZZO: No, it went - well, it went on into like, the eighth grade, about. ANDERSON: And then did you sort of block it out, compartmentalize it? APUZZO: I compartmentalized ... yeah, I just compartmentalized it but, you know, being Catholic, you know, being Catholic and having sex be such, you know, an overwhelming issue and inordinately, inordinately demonized by the church, when something like that is your first sexual experience, you just, um, you always carry it. You always feel that there's a burden of guilt on you, somehow you did it. You were responsible. It was your fault. At any rate ... ANDERSON: Did you get help from any adult at that time? APUZZO: No. I've never gotten ... I've never ... ANDERSON: Not ... no teachers, no one? APUZZO: No. No. Um, but I entered high school, and uh, was delighted to be there, had a great time. You know, a lot of us who went to Catholic school who were lesbian have crushes on teachers. I had the experience where the teachers had crushes on me. And it was overwhelming in not a good way. ANDERSON: How did they display their affection towards you? APUZZO: One nun kept a diary that she would give to me periodically. And um, it just ... it wasn't abuse in the way that we're experiencing the church today but it was ... it was emotionally imposing. It was...I was 13 years old. Um, to have all that attention, to be kept after school, to just ... for someone else's enjoyment. I mean, I got off on it. It was not like the world's worst thing, but again, there is a burden of an adult imposing their emotional needs on a youngster. This is just ... it's a theme in my life. ANDERSON: Did they do this to any other young woman that you knew of? APUZZO: Oh, yeah, you know. The nuns ... mostly the girls had crushes on the nuns, you know, and you knew the girls who had crushes on the nuns and it was, you know, it's like, very girl, blah-blah.

APUZZO: No. I've never gotten ... I've never ... ANDERSON: Not ... no teachers, no one? APUZZO: No. No. Um, but I entered high school, and uh, was delighted to be there, had a great time. You know, a lot of us who went to Catholic school who were lesbian have crushes on teachers. I had the experience where the teachers had crushes on me. And it was overwhelming in not a good way. ANDERSON: How did they display their affection towards you? APUZZO: One nun kept a diary that she would give to me periodically. And um, it just ... it wasn't abuse in the way that we're experiencing the church today but it was ... it was emotionally imposing. It was...I was 13 years old. Um, to have all that attention, to be kept after school, to just ... for someone else's enjoyment. I mean, I got off on it. It was not like the world's worst thing, but again, there is a burden of an adult imposing their emotional needs on a youngster. This is just ... it's a theme in my life. ANDERSON: Did they do this to any other young woman that you knew of? APUZZO: Oh, yeah, you know. The nuns ... mostly the girls had crushes on the nuns, you know, and you knew the girls who had crushes on the nuns and it was, you know, it's like, very girl, blah-blah. But, uh, I guess maybe it was my previous experience with an adult who, you know, really did such a boundary issue on me. But it was difficult to reconcile.

Native women are raped and sexually assaulted 3.5 times higher than any other race in the United States. That, to me, says priority issue. Yet the agency that is responsible for providing our health service has not even made that a priority by having a standardized set of policies and procedures for when a woman is brought into the emergency room. And that's not acceptable. What it means is that sometimes a woman will come into an emergency room and there's nobody trained to collect the forensic evidence, to do a rape kit. That service is contracted out and she may have to be transported or drive herself 50, 75, a hundred miles to a facility that has those services. And so, it means that there is a lack of evidence collected, because a lot of times a woman will not do that. They will go home, they'll take a shower, they'll start the process of healing, of dealing with what just happened. And so, it means that no forensic evidence is collected, so that there is no possible conviction that can occur. There is a predator that is out in the community to strike again. It means that no emergency contraceptive was offered. It means that later on down the line, if a pregnancy occurred, that under the constraints of the Hyde Amendment, because it was not reported to law enforcement, because there was no forensic exam done, that she wouldn't be eligible for an abortion. It means that she [would] not get the medication administered to her or even offered to her that would reduce her risk of contracting HIV, you know, or another sexually transmitted disease that could've occurred, so no treatment. So there are so many issues that are connected, and that are so important for a woman's health and reproductive health, that occur when she has been sexually assaulted, and these services need to be accessible. They need to be up to par. They need to be standardized, so that every woman that is brought in, or child that is brought into an emergency room within the Indian Health Service structure or system, receives the standard of care that will protect her and serve her needs ... a standard of care that a white woman would get in Beverly Hills or San Francisco or any other community. And not be victimized, or not treated as though it's a minimal occurrence, because that challenges who we are, and certainly is not, right now, a priority among Indian Health Service. So we're moving that whole issue forward through a coalition of women, not only mainstream organizations.

For instance, we're in the process of one right now. We put out this report on the sexual assault policies and protocols within Indian Health Service emergency rooms. And we did a survey of emergency rooms to look at the kinds of policies and procedures that take place. And we found out a whole lot, you know, and it wasn't good. So the next thing, after we put out that initial report on the results of our survey, is to convene a roundtable, because what happens in a roundtable is that we bring in the voices of the women from the communities and they share their realities. So that that initial report isn't just statistics. It is the voices of the women coming into the room and expressing what's actually ... what does it mean?

What does it mean when we say Indian Health Services does not have appropriate policies and procedures in their emergency rooms when a woman is sexually assaulted? What is the reality?

It's always there. We have to look at what our families went through in that colonization process. We have to look at what our mothers and our fathers went through, what our grandparents went through, what our great-grandparents went through ... and prior to that, before a reservation, all the wars, all the violence, and the famine and the relocation. You know, we have to look at all of those things and how that impacts our community and our lives today. In boarding schools, there was a horrendous amount of corporal punishment that took place, as well as sexual abuse. Our mothers, our fathers, were raped, were sodomized, were violated by the priests within the Catholic Church. And prior to contact with boarding school experience, sexual abuse was unheard of on children. It was unheard of in our culture ... not to say that it did not exist, but from all the questions and research that we have done and all the interviews, that on the very rare occasion when something like that would surface, it was dealt with harshly. Abandonment, you know ... you were abandoned by the tribe. You were set outside the camp to survive on your own and that's it. You were disappeared. It was dealt with very harshly. The impact and the volume of sexual assault that occurred and sexual abuse that occurred in the boarding schools, you know, the rapes and the molestations, have had a horrendous impact on our culture. And the appropriate resources have not been provided for us to deal with it appropriately by the Indian Health Service or Health and Human Services. So, what we're doing is, we're, in our communities, starting the healing process, the dialogue, because of the impact, generation after generation, that this has had on our people. And it's very important to start that process of dialogue, to start the process of ceremony, to start the process of healing and to engage in that, because Indian Health Service, for the magnitude of the problem, is virtually doing nothing.

We didn't just want the ones who were the professionals, we also wanted the regular women, you know. Of course, the Johannesburg people only brought in the professionals, because they didn't think the other women were ready. So, we trained them in Self-Help. But what was so wonderful, one of the women, Mankubo Manelepe(?), lived in Lenenye(?), in the Northern Transvaal of South Africa, and she was a smart woman.

How they worked with everything in a nonjudgmental way, that, I think it is really, um ... there's a lesson in there for all of us. So, I think, do your homework. Talk to other women.	AVERY: I think it's very important for younger women to gather as many of the cross-cultural reproductive health experiences of women that they can, because they need to show that this is not just something ... like, being in charge of your fertility, your reproduction, it's not just something for American women, European women, that across all the cultures from the beginning of time, this has been something that has been passed from women to women, and that we need to know how do Asians handle it, how do Southeast Asians handle it, how Indians handle it, how everybody handles it, so we have in our psyches a legend of how women have handled reproduction throughout the ages. And sometimes that will be what will give us our courage and give us our strength, because as we look back, we find out that these women ran into difficulties, that they ran into backlashes, that they ran into antis, but that they also ran into people who were grateful for the help that they were able to give them. That it is important to learn about the life of the grand midwives in the South, and how they took care of women who had babies, how they helped women who had had far too many babies and didn't want to have other babies, how they handled women who had been victims of rape, how they handled women who were victims of incest.

This is not necessarily something you get from books. Go up to women. Start the conversation. Have them talk to their relatives wherever they are, so that we can stop having us think that this is something unique at this time that's going on. It's been going on throughout the ages, and will continue.

". BEREK: But just in terms of just in New York City with the Central Labor Council, I mean, Harry Van Arsdale was the head of the New York City Central Labor Council. He ran the building trades, which was incredibly sexist, but then again, when 1199 tried to organize hospitals and we're having strikes that were not very effective, he stopped construction, and so when the women would really sit around bad-mouthing Harry, I would defend Harry and say, ""You can talk about what his union is like, but when push comes to shove, the most oppressed working women in New York City would not have a union without Harry."" And those guys who didn't have a feminist bone in their bodies and probably sat there and hooted and whistled at the women picketers when they went out in sympathy, [laugh] but in fact, they went out in sympathy. BANKS NUTTER: Right. They're still out there. BEREK: I was involved in, I guess this was probably the early '80s, when there was a mayoral race in New York, we all hated Ed Koch and so there was a mayoral campaign that was very union oriented and there were four union coordinators and there was three guys and me, and there was some big rally with all the big shots speaking and I was out in the audience, running around and getting things done, and Harry was up on the stage and, of course, the three guys were up on the stage. And Harry Van Arsdale looks in the audience and starts going, ""Where is she? Where is she? Where is that girl? She does all the work. The girl should be here, too. Where is she?"" And so, I went up on the stage and I was standing there and I was saying to myself, now, he just called me a girl. He's like 85 years old, right? He just called me a girl, but he also announced in front of the entire group that I was the only one who did the work. So you got to just sort of say to yourself, he's in his mid-eighties, he grew up in a time when calling me a girl was not insulting. But, I was insulted. So it was this sort of conflict of, you turn to Harry and [sneer] or you just get up on stage and say, he recognized my work. And that was sort of symbolically kind of a lot of the whole relationship between CLUW and the labor movement: they treated us like girls but they also, because they began to realize they had to, took on our issues. And so times change and things ultimately happen. I have three nieces who all went to what I think of as men's colleges, and, with the exception of the youngest of them, who went to Amherst, which went coed in the 1970s, the older two don't even have a clue they were men's colleges. They don't. They went to Harvard and Yale, you know? BANKS NUTTER: Yes, and when you tell them, oh, it was the '60s, late '60s, early '70s, when this changed ... lifetimes ago.

So that when the split came later, when the lesbians were all thrown out of Women's Liberation, it really hurt a lot because we had been so part of the movement and we had not pushed a separate lesbian agenda ever. You know, we had done what was the consensus work of that Women's Liberation movement. So one of the things we did that I remember quite well was that we decided to sit in at the office of the secretary of HEW, Health, Education and Welfare, which was the precursor of HHS, Health and Human Services that we have now, and again, I think we brought kids to that, too, actually, because nothing disrupts an office like children. And, you know, we didn't have our demands for childcare entirely in place but there was no childcare.

So that when the split came later, when the lesbians were all thrown out of Women's Liberation, it really hurt a lot because we had been so part of the movement and we had not pushed a separate lesbian agenda ever. You know, we had done what was the consensus work of that Women's Liberation movement. So one of the things we did that I remember quite well was that we decided to sit in at the office of the secretary of HEW, Health, Education and Welfare, which was the precursor of HHS, Health and Human Services that we have now, and again, I think we brought kids to that, too, actually, because nothing disrupts an office like children. And, you know, we didn't have our demands for childcare entirely in place but there was no childcare. And we also wanted people to see that we weren't against children, we were just against, you know, the lack of choice. I have a picture of this somewhere, you know, in the secretary's office. This was a sit-in. This was totally civil disobedience.

"Going back to positive women, there are folks like Denise Stokes, who was diagnosed with AIDS at like the age of sixteen, and became an activist by the time she was seventeen.

Folks like Patricia Nalls at ... who has inspired me of late, because when I say ""of late,"" it's because ... The epidemic itself is 27, almost 28 years old. However, the leadership roles that HIV-positive women and women diagnosed with AIDS have taken on have come much later in the epidemic. So now you do have folks like Patricia Nalls who continue to inspire me, in the sense that ... just like women who were survivors of rape are the women who started the first rape crisis centers in this country.

But we still don't have ... at least from a U.S. standpoint. Internationally we have a lot more data to actually quantify, you know, the impacts of HIV and violence on each other, the bicausal effect, the bidirectional effects. We have less data inside the United States. But what we do know is that for women who are in violent situations or even abusive relationships ... so there may not even be physical or sexual violence happening yet, but even if there's emotional and mental abuse going on, is that the diminishing of their own sense of power and capacity to effect change in their own relationships will also diminish their opportunity to negotiate safer sex, to get tested, to know their status, or to disclose their status once they're aware. If they are HIV-positive around disclosing their status, that means that they are less likely to engage in accessing health care. They're less likely to ask for help or be seen asking for help. And so the presence of violence actually disempowers a woman to do anything about HIV that she thinks might be her right or the right thing to do to protect herself. And from the other standpoint, because of the stigma and the discrimination associated with HIV and AIDS, for a woman who is positive, she has an increased risk of violence in a lot of ways, and the notion of ... if we talk about structural violence, that the criminalization of HIV has actually been increasing. So knowingly having HIV, or not knowing her status and putting other people at risk ... that's a constant burden that a woman or people with HIV walk with. And that increases violence if someone finds out and has not been informed about that HIV status. The fact that in relationships where most times ... most times ... women are monogamous. And partners, male partners, are more than likely not, especially those who are violent, may ... are more than likely are not monogamous, right? So you have women in monogamous situations who think they're in monogamous relationships and are not, with men who are in denial about the risks that they're bringing home to their family. So a woman who ends up HIV ... and this has happened over and over ... who confronts a partner about their HIV status ends up being battered, brutalized, or even killed because their partner is in such denial that they blame the wife or their female partner for that.

Those ... everybody was for them, but around those issues were issues that were emerging issues. How do you deal with the issue of rape? Is child abuse a feminist issue? And there were commissioners ... Catherine East, in fact ... who argued against including child abuse in our national plan of action. And I made a very strong statement. One of the earliest pieces of activism I did was to work behind the scenes with Gloria Steinem to get child abuse on the agenda.

What was not divisive was everything right in the middle: equal education, equal pay, childcare ...you know, basic civil rights. Those ... everybody was for them, but around those issues were issues that were emerging issues. How do you deal with the issue of rape? Is child abuse a feminist issue? And there were commissioners ... Catherine East, in fact ... who argued against including child abuse in our national plan of action. And I made a very strong statement. One of the earliest pieces of activism I did was to work behind the scenes with Gloria Steinem to get child abuse on the agenda.

I don't even know how to say this, but the accelerating aspect of feminism that made your victim status the most relevant totality of your experience, that you never had a relationship to your own oppression, that you never had a complicated relationship to what was done to you, that you never participated in it in any way. In order to try to say that women had not been asking for rape or incest, we went to a place that was really dangerous. (cough) Do we need to stop? Anyway, the tragedy of the attempt to reclaim women's lives by making us victims so that we could assign responsibility where we thought we had been powerless, and so we could reclaim women's right to, you know, claim that they were raped even though they were married, or incested even though they had been provocative little girls, you know, all of that kind of stuff, I think, had a terrible ultimate impact on where feminism ended up. Kind of making its arguments for what happened to women and what you had to think about. And that became an impossible place for me. I mean, I just felt like, you know, it doesn't make it OK to say what my father did to me. I'm not saying it's OK that my father raped me by also saying that I was attracted to his hands, but I don't want to leave one piece of it out in order to also talk about the other. And in incest stuff, for me, I found it really difficult precisely because my father was the person that I was the closest to in my family, and the violation was extraordinarily twisted precisely because I'm most like him and he most held out for me in my family and so what happens ... what betrayal looks like when it also is connected to the very best that you ... that somebody brought to you of love and hope is not either you were a victim and they were a monster or you deserved it and they didn't know what they were doing. And I kept feeling like the world was now shrinking into a whole variety of ideological sides that flattened the power of feminism, to speak to and help women understand and move forward their own lives."	"HOLLIBAUGH: Well, here's what I felt like ... I mean, I had not started talking about incest until 1980 or '81 when I met Dorothy. I had quietly said to friends and lovers what had happened to me or some version of that although pretty caut
ously. But again, in the women's movement when I would try to talk about my experience of incest, the class stuff was so sickening that I then ended up having to defend my father or my cousins or my uncle and say, or my mother, I ... so, when Dorothy and I met, and CherrÃƒÂ­ie was doing antiviolence work then, she was in New York and she was doing domestic violence work, I'm sure. And that was her job. And so Dorothy and CherrÃƒÂ­e and I would spend a lot of time talking about it. But Dorothy's who I first told the truth to, because Dorothy's life around that and my life around that were really quite similar although in different places, but equal ... not equally but in all the ways that people don't want to deal with the meaning of it, they were violent and transgressive and relentless and all of that stuff. And so it wasn't shameful to talk to her about my own history and so I could finally think about it and talk about it and we started doing a little bit of work around it with CherrÃƒÂ­e. We realized the class stuff was so bad that we couldn't figure out how to talk about without it instantly kind of sinking into a class discussion that we didn't have any tools for and that there was no markers around. So, people would ... felt completely free to comment on what they thought of your family. And I think parallel to that at the same time was the ...

You know, I mean, one of the things that I think never gets talked about in incest is ... not what the impact of incest is on you in relation to men as a woman, but what your relationship to other women is because women don't defend you when you're facing it as a girl-child. It is your mother t
at ... or your aunt or your cousin, girl-cousin ... that have to step in because it's not probably going to be a guy. And if women don't defend each other, then what does that mean about betrayal? You know, I always think it's interesting, Bastard out of Carolina, that at least Dorothy's mother never said to her, ""You're lying."" She couldn't finally defend her. She couldn't protect her and stay with that man. But she never made Dorothy ... she never betrayed Dorothy in the sense of making Dorothy be wrong in order to excuse herself for the inability she had to protect her daughter. My mother exactly did one of those pieces that I think is extraordinarily horrifying, and that you don't really ever get over, which is that she said very clearly, ""A man matters more than you and I will not risk my life for yours."" And that has lots of implications parentally, but it has an equal set of meanings for gender. And so to sit in a room with women who shared my politics and begin to talk about trying to make a vow that we would not betray each other, that we would not give each other's lives up for any desire, be it sexual or ideological, was riveting. And it changed forever my relationship to other women, because it meant that ... I still think of that and use that as a marker in the way that I try to live my life. To not ever be willing to give a woman up, even if she's willing to give herself up, and to always understand that women betray each other, and what that does to us in the ways that we never then value and trust each other and commit our lives to each other. Because committing your life to a woman whether you're a dyke or you're not a dyke is the hardest thing in this culture to do. To live your life for women rather than live your life for children or men, is to take a direction that's unheard of for women.

It was also the idea that people needed to meet autonomously and then come together. So black women were in Harlem, you know. We, Latinas met in the Lower East Side. And it's like everybody had a spot. Then we all came together. I'd yet to see that kind of organizing going on. So the whole notion of autonomous women of color organizing was just starting. And one of the reasons I started to work at the Rape Crisis Center is I felt like I didn't have enough non-cultural organizing experience of just doing grassroots organizing, basic organizing. I felt like I had always been dealing sort of with culture, you know, which is a form of work, but I wanted to really see what my worth was in terms of just being able to really, to run an organization or to actualize an organization and how women of color operated in it.

Well here, she shot him with a gun, but he was a great big man and she was a little woman, and she had her leg in a cast. Of course she needs a gun. That was the whole issue"

So the Defense Committee hired the Jury Project, which was growing out of the whole Attica struggle. Now the women in my CR group were working on the Attica case, and they were part of doing this Jury Project of showing they couldn't get a fair jury trial. You know what I'm talking about? And what happened was that they needed the jury project to come down, and move Joann's case out of this little county, where she was in jail, up to Raleigh so hopefully she'd get a fair trial there. And they were looking for people to do that survey work. Barbara got a job working with them, with my friend Beth Bonora, who was in the CR group. So she went down to North Carolina. She called me from down there. She said, ""Where are the feminists? This is terrible."" She was scared to death going into these racist little towns, and asking them what they thought of Joann Little. My God. And she'd never done anything like that either. She said, ""Where are the feminists?"" And I said, ""Well, you want me to come down?"" That's how I got into that. Again, you know, a door opens, and I walk through. So I went down.

I didn't think it was my fault. I didn't think it was my fault. I know whose fault it was, but I didn't think it was my fault. And I think, because I began speaking about these things, women started to come to me, individually and in small groups, and they wanted to talk about what happened to them, too. So, the beginning of this work is what we used to call Community Conversations, where we would just have something to eat, a cup of tea, a cup of coffee, and just talk about what was going on and what did it mean.	But a young, intelligent, undereducated, underemployed, physically and sexually abused, unmarried woman with a small child living in poverty ... you'd have been crazy as hell not to be depressed. (laughs) Me. And nobody ever looked at any of those things. They just said, We'll have to increase that medicine. Nobody ever talked to me about diet, exercise, anything that I could do except take medication, you know. And it wasn't just me. There were lots and lots of people lost in the medical system that just ... nobody ever talked to me about food supplements, you know, nothing. Nothing, nothing. Just take the medication. Just take the medication. And when I see what I saw over the years was, I saw so many women, not just get sick, but die. And I had lupus. And not just get sick, but die. I buried my friends ... from strokes, from heart attacks, from lupus, from high blood pressure, you know. It wasn't just about people being sick. The people died ... from battering, from domestic violence, from drug abuse, from poor decisions, you know. People died. People died. The women died. And we didn't know what was killing us. And we didn't have any place to talk together. Church wasn't helpful, because at church, they talk to you, you don't get to talk, you know. It's helpful because you learn some stuff, I guess, if you go or whatever, but the people didn't have an opportunity to express themselves.

Well yeah, you know, these African American men, it doesn't matter that they were poor young men in southeast Arkansas who were recruited to play basketball and are not given an education while they're there, and the second they have an injury are tossed out and back in poverty. We're not going to talk about race and class, we're going to talk about all of that. So that was our work.

In a war situation, just like Abu Ghraib and different things that have happened with American soldiers terrorizing and raping and doing things that soldiers feel they have a right to do when they're in another country. It's a man thinking that he has the right to rape a woman of another language. That happened in World War II. In the case of World War II, very often it was the Japanese soldiers going to China or the Philippines, and so you have people there who hate the Japanese, rightfully so, because of what they perceive to be such a dehumanizing situation. Those same people ... if, for example, I spoke Japanese or spoke English with a Japanese accent, and I went into a group and tried to give them AIDS 101, they would be thinking to themselves, What is that Japanese woman ... look what the Japanese did during World War II.

1218	Ports, Suki	SCVF	1934	1930	NY	Asian	Bachelor's degree	Married (except if separated)	3	2008.0	74	"And I think I clearly see that when I wanted to send my children to the school I'd gone to, and my husband and I believed in public education, and I went down to the local school, I saw that it was not going to be possible for me to send our children to that school. So I would either have to do something about it, or find a private school for them to go to. I think the saddest day was when I felt I had to take my children out of public school, and that was because a seven-year-old little girl was raped at the lunch hour, and she came into the school office and said, ""A man was playing with my pussy."" And she had blood streaming down her legs, and she was crying. And the school principal, who was a woman of color, told her to sit down on the bench, went into the office, shut the door, and talked to the Board of Education legal department to see what her legal liability was in the case of this child. Nobody hugged that child. Nobody cleaned that child up. Nobody called that child's mother. Nobody called the police. They left that child for one hour sitting on the bench crying, and letting the blood keep down her legs. It was not until the next morning, when I had brought my children to school, and my husband was home sick, and I was standing in front of the school chitchatting with a few of the other parents. Somebody ... who I promised I would never divulge who it was, somebody said to me, ""You don't know what happened in the school yesterday, but you'd better find out quick. Let me tell you, a child was raped,"" and proceeded to tell me, and said, ""You'd better do something about it because nothing is being done about it in the school."" So I said, ""Well, what are you doing about it?"" Well, of course he kept walking down the street when I said that. So I talked to the parents, and I said, ""We've got to do something. This is what happened."" And everybody was outraged. But I realized what this little girl must have gone through. Nobody hugged her and said, That man was wrong; you didn't do anything wrong. This school principal convinced the mother to take her out of the school. And I realized how young women are not treated in a respectful way for what their feelings are or what happens. Now this was only one case, but as we were standing out there talking, a car came cruising along, and it was the local community relations policeman, and he was this wonderful Irish guy. He got out of his car, and he said, ""Well, Suki, what are you doing standing out here?"" I said, ""You know damn well what I'm doing out here. I'm telling the other parents what I've just heard about wha
 was going on in the school yesterday."" So he said, ""Oh, you heard?"" I said, ""Yes, I heard."" He said, ""That bitch!"" And I said, ""Excuse me?"" He said, ""She could have called us. The kid gave such a description of that man, we could have picked him up in no time because the kid gave such a good description of what the man looked like and what the man had on and what he smelled like."" He said, ""We're furious."" I said, ""If you're so mad, would you, please ... you're in plain clothes ... would you please go walking around the school and see who stops you, and check all the doors, see if they're all locked."" So he said, ""Well, you know, they have to be able to open them from the inside out."" I said, ""Yeah, but I want to know if they're locked from the outside so the guy can't get in. He got in somehow."" So he went around, and he said, ""Nobody stopped me. Half the people don't know who I am. Some of the people know who I am."" Some of the administration knew him, but the average teacher didn't know him. He said, ""Nobody stopped me."" Now this was the day after a very serious issue. So the parents ... we got together, and we said, Well, we're going to have to stop everybody from going in the school. We discussed, What are we going to do? Finally we decided, Okay, we're going to have armbands on all the teachers, and we're going to tell the children they may not talk to anybody who doesn't have an armband on. And if somebody doesn't have an armband on, they should tell their teacher they saw somebody and give a description. And nobody can come in the building unless they agree to have an armband put on. Well, you know, you'd think this would be a perfectly reasonable solution. There were teachers who refused to put an armband on. ""I'm not going to wear something like that."" Well now, if it had been their child that was raped, wouldn't they want to do something? We couldn't think of anything to do without disrupting the educational program, but we thought this would be perfectly simple. Teach the kids somebody was hurt in the school and not everybody in the school should be in the school. So I learned about the stereotypes of ... A teacher doesn't necessarily care about the children she's teaching; a teacher doesn't necessarily care about the issue. And so we ended up having to go to court because a few teachers pushed, shoved, accused us of pushing, shoving ... you know, got into a thing. Well, eventually the hearing officer, the judge, chastised the teachers for not doing what they should have been doing, and thanked us as parents for taking an interest. And that even annoyed me, because I thought, Why do you have a stereotype that parents wouldn't have an interest in their children? But there are so many ingrown concerns that people have about other people and how they act or don't act. And so we ended up closing the street, we ended up doing all kinds of things to have demonstrations, and finally they agreed to having somebody on patrol. Now, this isn't now, where you have guns being looked at or security things going on with the children. This was a little seven-year-old girl, and nobody protected her and nobody said, We're sorry. And she was whisked away, and she was sent to another school."

I don't remember how it happened, but I do remember very clearly that I went down to Washington, D.C., and went to Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon's house to talk about her coming up to Philadelphia to work with Anna Crusis to learn some of her music. And so, how was that going to happen? Now, I mean, I actually read some of this the other day, that she gave me tapes to take up from that visit to give to the choir to try and learn, because it's all from the oral tradition, and not much of it had been written down. This was in '79. Oh my gosh, it's so different. And so she said she'd come up and work. There were three songs. And I guess we learned them from the tapes.

I don't remember how it happened, but I do remember very clearly that I went down to Washington, D.C., and went to Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon's house to talk about her coming up to Philadelphia to work with Anna Crusis to learn some of her music. And so, how was that going to happen? Now, I mean, I actually read some of this the other day, that she gave me tapes to take up from that visit to give to the choir to try and learn, because it's all from the oral tradition, and not much of it had been written down. This was in '79. Oh my gosh, it's so different. And so she said she'd come up and work. There were three songs. And I guess we learned them from the tapes.

She kept saying it, and I think she probably said it in Philadelphia, but I really heard it in Cincinnati: What are you singing? And what you sing absolutely is important in terms of people coming to your concert and if they see themselves. So in Philly, in those eight years, we were not in as many diverse communities as we could have been. I don't want to say we were just singing to the chorus, to the choir, but you know, there was a ground swell of people becoming feminists, becoming lesbian, becoming political in that time period. So, you know, in Philadelphia, whatever it was, there were two thousand people at the Take Back the Night rally. That's a fairly sizable number I think. And then concerts, I don't know, they said six hundred, and stuff like that. So that's a pretty good draw. So we performed for women's organizations. The same as in lots of cities, you perform in churches. Too bad they're not incredible musical performance halls that seat eight hundred or something like that. FOLLET: Right. ROMA: They're not, in most cities, that are available financially. FOLLET: Right. You've got two minutes. ROMA: Oh, OK. Well, I was aware that before I left, you know, we were going into more working-class areas and performing at settlement houses and things like that, people doing grassroots kind of work, and I think that was beginning to happen there when I was there. Otherwise I think it's progressive people, mainly, so in a sense singing to the choir. Maybe more women in the audiences then men, not necessarily so now in MUSE. Maybe more lesbians, feminist people in the audience, because it was that time. It was just, you know, so much was going on and our numbers seemed to be bigger, or people coming in to us are [from the] progressive community. So I don't think there was the diversity in terms of outreach and repertoire and venue, so that then that affects who the audience is.

He was in real estate, and I think he owned a brewery, and she made him sell the brewery, because she didn't approve of drinking, before she would marry him, even though she was only 17 or so. WHITE: Wow. There you go. STEINEM: She was a very interesting woman, who became, as I realize now ... I didn't realize at the time ... a suffragist in the era, and was the first woman in the state of Ohio to be elected, I think, to the school board, even before women had the vote nationally. WHITE: And her name was? STEINEM: Pauline Perlmutter Steinem. WHITE: Great. STEINEM: She got elected by organizing women to go to vote together. Women were kept away from the polls by gangs of men and boys who would harass them sexually, basically, if they came to vote. So she organized women to go in a group, and that was what allowed her to win. WHITE: Take your posse and go vote. STEINEM: Right. And she ran on a coalition ticket with the Socialists and the Anarchists. (laughter) WHITE: That's good, that's good. STEINEM: But I didn't know this about her until a feminist in Toledo, a historian, wrote a monograph about her. Because what survived as admirable in the family history was that she was a great cook, that she had four sons, that she kept a kosher table, that she was an educator. She was a pioneer of vocational education. Not the more rebellious parts. WHITE: The radical activism. STEINEM: Right. It wasn't that they concealed it. They just didn't talk about it.

1974 that I began working at the Rape Crisis Center. And at first, I was just sort of doing all kinds of things, you know, doing a little hotline stuff, a little community education stuff. It wasn't all ... and really, I think they were sort of preparing me for Nancy's job, the general administrator, because she was going to leave, and after she left, I became general administrator. ROSS: OK. What was going on in your thinking about black women and the women's movement at the time? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, child, a lot of things. First of all, I mean, I was very passionate about the issue of rape and sexual assault and women being helped. I was very disturbed by what seemed to me to be the lack of a presence of black women and women of color in the movement. But certainly many of our clients were black women. So what was going on in my mind was one, how to serve women and two, how to get more women of color involved in the Rape Crisis Center and get the Rape Crisis Center more connected with the community, beyond what it was. It was also, initially, in the beginning, it was a learning time for me, you know, to learn exactly what is feminism. You know, how do people define feminism? What is the scope of feminism under that definition? Learning more about pornography, because I'd never really thought about pornography ... you know, nasty men read pornography at night when nobody's looking, or something. I mean, in terms of thinking of it as an industry that disempowered women or, you know, devalued or objectified, all of that. Those were not really words in my vocabulary or concepts, you know. So my first months at the Rape Crisis Center, first year, was a learning process for me, too. Learning more about feminist thinking and what the issues and the politics of it was. And always trying to see how it fit and integrated in my community, because I certainly saw the urge to try to make people split and choose. If you're black, you can't be a feminist. If you're a feminist, you're not black. If you're for the women's struggle, then you can't be for the people's struggle. If you're for the people's struggle, then how can you isolate out just the women. All that craziness, you know, just trying to navigate my way through it, figure out what the heck was going on. ROSS: Name some of the black feminists who may have influenced your thinking, you may have encountered in the mid-70s. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh. I mean, certainly people who I was reading, that came more toward, I guess ... I'm trying to think. When did I first read something from bell hooks and something from Audre Lorde? I don't think that I knew a lot of black women, because I hadn't really ... in the rape crisis movement at that time, hadn't really come across, you know, hardly any other black women. I mean, I knew about New York Women Against Rape and so I knew some of them had to be something, somebody had to be black or Puerto Rican or something like that. But I didn't really know a whole lot about who the women were. Of course, I mean, I heard of like the star feminists at the time, you know, Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan and, um, Bella Abzug and Flo Kennedy, you know, I'd heard of, but I didn't really know a lot about that. ROSS: So at the time, we're talking about '74, '75, '76, what was the Rape Crisis Center doing vis-Ãƒ -vis black women in terms of outreach to or work with or ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Talking about it. Even though they always made a concerted effort to bring black women onto the staff, they really felt that going into the schools or education should be a black woman, because that's mainly who was going to be in those schools, that that was in the staff, there should be black women. There was really a problem recruiting. There seemed to be a problem to recruit black people onto the board of directors, you know, who came or who actually stayed. So for the most part, most of the time, for a really long time, the board was always ... basically, it was white, as was, now, in '76, when we went with CETA and VISTA, you know, and CETA was the concentrated employment program [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act], so that brought us quite a few women of color, and then VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, that brought us ... so that was the time when we had the largest women-of-color staff. We had Latino women, because we wanted to do work in Addams, which was a predominantly Latino community, to assess the attitudes about rape and what kind of services and what people did there, and the same in the black community. So, we had, like, three or four Latino sisters and about six black women that came on specifically through CETA and VISTA. I think the main way that the Rape Crisis Center at the time was reaching the black community was through the services provided for clients. They were just always aware that they were very lacking and very short in terms of the relationships and the networks et cetera to be a crisis center in the District of Columbia."

So I was very much centered in, staying in, things that had to do with women and children. At the same time, I was moving more into, within the social service realm, in terms of nonprofit but in terms of funding and ways that people looked at things that were much more systematized and much closer to where politics began to get more and more vacuumed out of the conversation, you know, out of the programs, really, in many ways, out of the expression of the staff.

Once I came back, I became the director for community education. That's the job that I held. That's the position that I held until I left. I brought Anti-Rape Week into the Rape Crisis Center, something I'm really proud of, because it exists today under a different name, but ... ROSS: What was Anti-Rape Week? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Anti-Rape Week was a massive education week where there were all kinds of workshops, seminars, film showings organized, and we advertised and people would come out to events. So it was to build education to raise prevention awareness, and to recruit people into an awareness of, and hopefully support for, the Crisis Center and to take a look at and become advocates for the issue of sexual assault, rape. So we did Anti-Rape Week, and then the women who were a part of FAAR, Feminists Against Pornography, if that was the right name, organized. The Rape Crisis Center had actually worked and organized the first Take Back the Night march in D.C., which I think was in 1978. I think it was in 1978. And then, the following year, I organized Anti-Rape Week. I don't think we had a march that year. Then the following year is like when Feminists Against Pornography picked up and decided that that was going to be one of their major things that they would do every year was organize a Take Back The Night march and the Crisis Center would work with them, so we coordinated so that the Take Back the Night march became a part of Anti-Rape Week, either the beginning or the end, you know, a major activity. [As a member of Feminists Against Pornography, Marty Langlen, a white woman, was central to this organizing effort. She also became a member of the Rape Crisis Center board of directors. Another woman with Feminists Against Pornography who did a lot of work was Clarisse.] And Anti-Rape Week evolved into Rape Awareness Week, and then as the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault took up rape awareness, and ultimately had Rape Awareness Month, which the rape crisis centers across the country pretty much observed and organized for that in their communities. The hassle-free zone. There was a lot of street harassment going on in D.C. There was a sister named Linda Leaks, not was, she is, who was in school at the time and she was making a film on street harassment, and she was so impassioned about it ... ROSS: She is a black woman. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Linda Leaks is a black woman who was making a film on sexual harass[ment] ... street harassment, and Linda was so impassioned about it that she also created a t-shirt to stop violence against women, you know, verbal abuse of women. Well, at the time that she was doing that, dealing with the street harassment and kind of strategizing around how to combat it and how to respond to it, white women were also doing some organizing and they had come to the idea that they wanted to make Dupont Circle ... in D.C., Dupont Circle was, is an area that is sort of a hub area for the commercial district downtown and people come there and they eat lunch and walk through, and then, it's part of the social life at night. So there's a lot going on in Dupont Circle and around Dupont Circle. So you can get harassed walking through there or sitting in there and trying to eat your lunch, and all of that. So a group of white women had decided they wanted to be able to not be hassled in Dupont Circle, so they wanted that to be, you know ... My idea was that they could not take Dupont Circle and single out Dupont Circle as a place not to be harassed, that if we were going to try to have a campaign, we needed to wage a campaign to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. So that you would have the right, wherever you were, not to be ""Hey, baby, hey, mama,"" all of that kind of nonsense ... ""What's your sign? What's your name?"" ... all of that, that you wouldn't have to deal with it. So, we [joined forces and] entered on a real struggle to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. We met with the police, you know, because we wanted to have penalties. We wanted to have it written in law somewhere, you know, penalties around this whole thing. And we worked on it for about two years, but we just couldn't really make it happen. It was too big. But in the process, there was a lot of education. We used to have what were called speak-outs, and we'd just be different places, at a Metro stop on a Friday, in Dupont Circle on a Wednesday, maybe down at the Federal Triangle on a Monday, Easter Market, various places, to do rallies, where people would speak out about street harassment, sexual harassment on the streets, and we would make the interconnections between street harassment and pornography and rape, you know. And we did a lot of consciousness-raising and a lot of great organizing as a result of that in those two years that we worked on that. Also, doing the organizing of the Take Back the Night marches and the Anti-Rape Weeks that we did for a number of years, that is one of the ways that I was able to bring a lot of women of color into the Rape Crisis Center, that came to work and organize around these different issues for Anti-Rape Week. More women of color than the Rape Crisis Center had ever seen collectively in all the years prior to that. Women came in and it was a very exciting process. They volunteered to be on the hotlines and as a result ... and that was all, that was really good stuff. ROSS: Describe, if you don't mind me backing up just a little bit, what was going on that caused the 1980 conference to happen, or am I going too far? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, no. You're speaking about the first conference on Third World Women and Violence. It came about because there was that need to pull women of color together, to acknowledge that violence existed in our communities, to talk about the forms that it took, the kinds of responses that we got to it, the attitudes that existed there, and what needed to be done. It also came about because women of color who were doing this work desperately needed to know each other. We needed to network. We needed to build and consolidate a network. And so, though that conference brought about 80 women, you know, in total, however, they came from a lot of different places, and we were able to find out about, like Fatima Cortez, with that little rape crisis center up there in New Bedford or someplace in Massachusetts. We had the New York Women Against Rape come down, that's when we had the great honor to meet and develop our first relationship with Sandra Comacho, Ch
rrÃƒÂ­e Moraga, and those women from New York. The women from Boston came, and so we first met ... not Barbara ... I'm trying to remember ... Barbara Bullette was there. It was the woman who was the therapist, Ruth something [Ruth Hall]. But a few women came from Boston. We all ... that was the start of the building and continuation of a network. Those were the first steps towards that. So that was really, that was really a great, a great conference. And it was really exciting. It was part of ... we made it a part of Anti-Rape Week and it was great, and it was where we got ... I believe it's where we got our famous logo. ROSS: Tell me about that logo. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Our famous logo which represented ... the Rape Crisis Center had this beautiful logo that ironically, it was done for us by a brother named Malik Edwards, who used to be one of the artists for the Black Panther Party, who drew the pictures for the Panther Speaks newspaper, and we asked Malik if he would develop ... wait, let me back up for one second. I'm running two thoughts together. I'm running this thought ... no, I know what it is. The Shanti Dolls. I was getting ready to run it in with ICAW [International Council of African Women] and the Dolls that Beverly did for us. OK. Put that on the side. Malik, who had been in the Black Panther Party, we asked him if he would develop a logo for us for our conference, the Third World Women and Violence Conference, and he drew for us ... he came back with four fertility dolls, one looking Asian, one African born in America, one First Nation, and one Latina, and it was the details on the fertility dolls that determined the ethnicity of each of them. And so these four together represented women of color, and made an extremely powerful statement. So it became the logo for the Third World Women and Violence conference. And then our very next edition of the Rape Crisis Center publication that dealt with myths and facts about rape, we used that logo on it. And it was just ... what can I say? It was a success. Anyone whoever looked at it loved it. Of course, there did come a time, somewhere down the road, where there was conflict when someone said, ""There's no white doll, you know, there's only four, there should be five dolls."" Why? ""There's no white woman."" Well, the logo didn't change. It didn't expand, you know, under the creator's vision. That was his vision of what we had asked him to do for that conference, so that was that. So that is how the Third World Women and Violence ... it's called the First National, because it actually was the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence, and we were honored to be the people to put out the call for that. [Deirdre Wright, who worked at the Rape Crisis Center at the time, was conference coordinator.]"	"TOURÃƒÂ‰: I did do a lot of things at the Rape Crisis Center, speaking with all humility and truth. Once I came back, I became the director for community education. That's the job that I held. That's the position that I held until I left. I brought Anti-Rape Week into the Rape Crisis Center, something I'm really proud of, because it exists today under a different name, but ... ROSS: What was Anti-Rape Week? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Anti-Rape Week was a massive education week where there were all kinds of workshops, seminars, film showings organized, and we advertised and people would come out to events. So it was to build education to raise prevention awareness, and to recruit people into an awareness of, and hopefully support for, the Crisis Center and to take a look at and become advocates for the issue of sexual assault, rape. So we did Anti-Rape Week, and then the women who were a part of FAAR, Feminists Against Pornography, if that was the right name, organized. The Rape Crisis Center had actually worked and organized the first Take Back the Night march in D.C., which I think was in 1978. I think it was in 1978. And then, the following year, I organized Anti-Rape Week. I don't think we had a march that year. Then the following year is like when Feminists Against Pornography picked up and decided that that was going to be one of their major things that they would do every year was organize a Take Back The Night march and the Crisis Center would work with them, so we coordinated so that the Take Back the Night march became a part of Anti-Rape Week, either the beginning or the end, you know, a major activity. [As a member of Feminists Against Pornography, Marty Langlen, a white woman, was central to this organizing effort. She also became a member of the Rape Crisis Center board of directors. Another woman with Feminists Against Pornography who did a lot of work was Clarisse.] And Anti-Rape Week evolved into Rape Awareness Week, and then as the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault took up rape awareness, and ultimately had Rape Awareness Month, which the rape crisis centers across the country pretty much observed and organized for that in their communities.

As I recall, there was, in 1970 or '71, there was this big women's speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the women's movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillen's apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My Sister's Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power. All the things that everyone criticized women for having as part of an analysis of violence against women ... who now, the mainstream themselves, embrace a large part of that ideology or that perspective, that politic, or that analysis, however you want to say it, about that, that they didn't do before, Post Traumatic Stress [Disorder], you know, rape trauma syndrome, just any number of things that the women were saying in '72, '73, '74 went on for so long, that the more traditional society, law enforcement, medical, social, was rejecting all of that, have now had to come around and embrace it. And not just embrace it, but kind of like take it over and claim it, like this was their thinking, their theory, all along and all the time, which was just so outrageous, such revisionist history. In that house, in that apartment on Q Street, and it stayed there in Jackie's apartment for some time. And from Jackie's apartment, the first place it went was to that small, two-room across the street from Lincoln Junior High School on 16th and Irvin Street. ROSS: OK. There were some feminist magazines, and wasn't there a group called the D.C. Area Feminists Alliance? TOURÃƒÂ‰: FAAR. ROSS: Feminist [Alliance] Against Rape. Tell me about FAAR and ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, FAAR was ... some of the women in FAAR were from the Rape Crisis Center who had left the Rape Crisis Center, wanted to do something else or do some things differently, and so there were people who were interested in publishing, and they got interested because there was also a quarterly scholarly magazine called Quest. Quest preceded FAAR, you know, because it was more scholarly, a quarterly and all that. So you had women who worked on Quest who were interested in putting some focus around rape and so forth, and you had women who had been at the Rape Crisis Center who had an interest in putting out written materials and educating in that way, so they got FAAR magazine. The thing I'm trying to remember, because it had two incarnations, as FAAR and as Aegis magazine. And actually, what I think is that they became FAAR the collective. The magazine was Aegis magazine, and it carried articles and information on sexual assault and theory around sexual assault, you know, all kinds of tips, this, that, the other, different stuff, stories, articles that had to do with empowering women and all of that. Later, Aegis joined with ... oh, yes, and of course, dealing with pornography as well. Later, Aegis joined with domestic violence and half the magazine would deal with issues related to sexual assault, pornography, and the other half would deal with issues dealing with battering and domestic violence. ROSS: Did you get the sense that in the early years, the people at the Rape Crisis Center worked on other forms of violence that women experienced, or was it just gender-based violence? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It was gender-based violence. However, definitely gender based, although the Center did recognize that it was possible for a man to be raped, it was obviously not the primary focus, but there was certainly the acknowledgment that men could be sexually assaulted. You had individuals who worked at the enter who may have had involvement and ties into other movements around other issues, but the Crisis Center was strictly dealing with rape and had its hands full to deal with that, because in '72 and '75, I mean, the police, everybody, I mean, it was a battle. You know, if we ... it still continues to be a struggle, you know, but it was a battle. It was a war, you know, in terms of they didn't want you to have companions. I mean, all rape crisis centers, now you can have a companion with the woman at the hospital that's from the center. So, Oh, no, you couldn't do that. They didn't want you there because you impeded the investigation by being there. So then it was, like, the only way you could be there was if the woman requested that you be there. I mean, it was all these things, you know. Women asked for it. It was just horrendous. So they weren't just dealing ... they were not really making connections to anything else. They were dealing with the dynamics of gender, you know, and as time moves forward, began to ... around different issues, make connections, broaden out ... ROSS: OK. Now, you're saying that your working at the Rape Crisis Center affected your marriage. In what way did your consciousness that you developed at the Center cause you to re-look at your marriage? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It wasn't working at the Rape Crisis Center that caused me to ... I didn't need Rape Crisis Center. I mean, in all honesty, I didn't need the Rape Crisis Center to help me with that at all. When I was saying, working, I meant working in terms of the finances of it. You know, where if the man doesn't have a regular job or steady job and you do even just part-time, full-time, whatever it is, the dynamics that that creates. No, it wasn't a consciousness from the Rape Crisis Center. It was just the consciousness of, you got to go, because somebody's going to get hurt, OK. And so, I ain't fit for it to be me, so, and you're not leaving my child no place else, so you got to go	TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. As I recall, there was, in 1970 or '71, there was this big women's speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things.

Rape Crisis Center	"TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, you know, we had the bookstore and I had Against Rape, and there was a book prior to Against Rape that was on the topic of rape. And in that area of Northeast, there had been a couple of assaults surrounding the neighborhood where we lived, or where the bookstore was, and we'd had a couple of meetings where women could come out and talk about it. ROSS: Who's the ""we""? TOURÃƒÂ‰: We, meaning myself and a couple of other women were Save the People. ROSS: All black women? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: What year was this? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Seventy-four, late '73, maybe early '74. And as a result, I was on the radio one day, on WHUR, doing an interview and talking about rape and sexual assault, and some women at the Rape Crisis Center were listening to WHUR. Now that in itself is an intriguing mystery. ROSS: Why were these white women at the Rape Crisis Center listening to this black radio station at Howard University called WHUR? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes, it must have been because Michelle was there. So, anyway, yeah, because Michelle said she heard it, so they had WHUR on and they heard this interview, and they wanted to find ... Oh, there's another black woman in D.C. talking about rape. We must find her. And I got a call from, I believe it was Deb Freidman at the bookstore, and asking me ... introducing herself, she was from the Rape Crisis Center, and asking if I would meet and talk with them about ... and I went and I admit, I was curious. I mean, the Rape Crisis Center. I was curious. I went. We talked. I met Michelle. Michelle asked me to go to American University with her and do a presentation. And that, sort of, was the genesis of the relationship with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. ROSS: So describe to me who Michelle Hudson was. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Michelle Hudson was the community education coordinator. She was black, she was the second ... the Rape Crisis Center started in 1972 and so, we are now up to '74, so it's only been, like, two years. It's very young. Nancy McDonald is the general administrator ... because we try not to be hierarchical, so we have don't have an executive director, no executive director at that point in time ... the general administrator, who generally administrates. OK, so we had a general administrator, and the community education coordinator. And because Nancy, had ... I'm trying ... there was a reason, OK, the point was that the community education coordinator made more than the general administrator, because they based it around need and not just around title or hierarchy. So it was kind of collective sense of in the beginning, it was very interesting. This little tiny, two-room, upstairs, across from a junior high school, Lincoln Junior High School, up on 16th and Irvin Street. They were in a house across the street, upstairs. So that is how ... that is who Michelle was. She was the community education coordinator. She did a lot of the work of creating the first materials that were used for education and her job was to go out in the D.C. public schools and do presentations on rape and prevention, and that is what she did.

1278	Toure, Nkenge	SCVF	1951	1950	MD	Black or African American	9th to 12th grade but no diploma	Divorced	2	2004.0	53	Wow. Well, first of all, I don't know if herstory can say it or history can say it or whatever. I know one thing is that in the 13 years that I worked at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, I served a lot of people and I helped a lot of people. And I still run into people sometimes who say, you know, I remember when you used to work at the Rape Crisis Center. You were my counselor. Or, You were the counselor for a friend of mine. Things like that. Because I counseled a lot of women when I worked at the Rape Crisis Center, and I feel good about that. Also doing the education in the schools, the program, I run into people who say, I remember when you came to my school. You came to Roosevelt. You came to Paul. You came to Hart. You came to Charles Drew. You came to my school. And that was really good. So I feel that I have touched a number of people's lives in a personal way that may not ever get broadcast, and sometimes I think about, What if I had not ever worked at the Rape Crisis Center? There would have been these people who wouldn't have got touched in that way that, you know, that you helped them to be able to heal theirselves and resolve their conflicts so their lives could be better. That's really good. Um, I think that the involvement of women of color at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, through the organizing for Anti-Rape Week and working with the people who organized the Take Back the Night marches and the very first Third World Women and Violence conference, national conference, held in this country, that though were only about 75 women or so that attended, it was a significant thing for the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence. I think that I played a significant role in helping to shape and develop a network and a movement of like-minded, feminist-minded, whatever, third world women and women of color in the metropolitan area in doing work in the area of violence against women, you know, kind of coming together to study and to expand around violence against women, because we were looking at sexual assault, domestic violence. We were looking at street harassment, you know, we actually tried to get D.C. declared a hassle-free zone, free of the hassle, sexual, verbal harassment and hassling of women. I worked on the interfamily bill to change the definition and way of dealing with domestic violence and battering, on the rape bill. Just the consciousness of women around being active in gender politics, helping to facilitate this idea that we had to end the silence in our communities, and I think that all of these third world women of color, African American women, women in the Latino community, and so forth and so on, but definitely in the black community, of pushing and making dialog happen in our communities around us when people didn't want to hear it, you know, and challenging people and their ideas about it. So I think, I believe I've made some contributions in that area, you know, maybe helping to extend how people look at violence against women, like [what] we did with the whole braid thing, when they were wanting to fire these women at the hotel because they were wearing their hair in cornrows, you know. And I said that that was a form of psychological violence against women, and even though I had to sort of struggle with the Rape Crisis Center, the Crisis Center was able to initiate and take the leadership to organize a major demonstration in front of the Marriott Hotel down on 14th Street, where we actually had the unions, a couple of the union locals involved, and had almost a thousand people out there in the streets, including Ras Michael out there in the streets to protest that.

It's not like he raped anybody, that sort of thing. And I can clearly remember one day, I was ... two particular occasions.

1281	Toure, Nkenge	SCVF	1951	1950	MD	Black or African American	9th to 12th grade but no diploma	Divorced	2	2004.0	53	That's where we get those sayings like, The hearts of people are not conquered until the hearts of its women are on the ground. That's where, you know, all these different ideas come from in terms of resistance to this, but you see and you know that it's true because, if not, why is it happening? When you talk about spoils of war, how is it that women, who are human beings, become a part of the spoils of war, do you know? That you demoralize a village by raping all the women in the village? That you have an idea that you can improve a race of people, lighten them up, make them more worthy, more acceptable by raping the women and having them rape ... like in the Sudan with the Geneina, where they're talking about, you know, You're too black and we need lighter people in the Sudan. You're black, you're ugly, you know. So you're systematically trying to genocide out a people and bring about a new people ... all of this through the wombs of women. I find this quite disturbing, quite terrifying, as a woman with a womb and a vagina. This kind of bothers me, you know. So you have all these places where these male-dominant attitudes prevail, not just on the level of conflict, but on the internal level within the society where these exist ... in places in Africa where people believe that if you rape a virgin, that it'll cure you of AIDS. It's like, whatever could you be saying? You know, it's this idea in India that if the woman does something she disgraces the whole family and she must be punished, so, you know, we can just set her on fire, because we have to avenge the honor of this family.	I had been thinking about this ... because I'm doing this work, because I'm organizing this program around rape as a weapon of war, it's got me thinking a number of things because of these places where these things intersect. We're talking about rape as a weapon of war, you're looking at all the various places where there is conflict in the world, on the globe, and what that means for women and children, and particularly, you know, what it means for women in these places of conflict and as it relates to globalization and imperialism and fascism, racism. It's very significant. We're in 2005, so we're at the beginning of the 21st century, and at the end of the 20th century, et cetera, so you've been looking at things like what happens with women in conflict, what happened with the women in Bosnia, Kosovo, what's happening in the Sudan, Congo, what happened with Rwanda, Haiti, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Nicaragua. Just sort of start naming places ... Korea, South Korea, Vietnam, the Civil War ... just start naming places, and see and look at the treatment of women and the treatment of children, you know. Why were they treated that way? They were treated that way because they were women. They were treated that way because, in society, all these societies where there's male chauvinism and gender male dominance exists, they're seen as property. So thus, they are used in that way as well to discourage a nation, to make men feel powerless because they were not able to protect part of their greatest treasures of things that they own, you know. That's where we get those sayings like, The hearts of people are not conquered until the hearts of its women are on the ground. That's where, you know, all these different ideas come from in terms of resistance to this, but you see and you know that it's true because, if not, why is it happening? When you talk about spoils of war, how is it that women, who are human beings, become a part of the spoils of war, do you know? That you demoralize a village by raping all the women in the village? That you have an idea that you can improve a race of people, lighten them up, make them more worthy, more acceptable by raping the women and having them rape ... like in the Sudan with the Geneina, where they're talking about, you know, You're too black and we need lighter people in the Sudan.

I find this quite disturbing, quite terrifying, as a woman with a womb and a vagina. This kind of bothers me, you know. So you have all these places where these male-dominant attitudes prevail, not just on the level of conflict, but on the internal level within the society where these exist ... in places in Africa where people believe that if you rape a virgin, that it'll cure you of AIDS. It's like, whatever could you be saying? You know, it's this idea in India that if the woman does something she disgraces the whole family and she must be punished, so, you know, we can just set her on fire, because we have to avenge the honor of this family. What are you talking about? These kinds of conflicts that exist even on an internal level within the country, within the tribe, within the society, whatever, you know, women are the ones who are abused, the ones who are traded off and traded for. In a situation where a woman, her husband dies, in some societies where the husband dies so now the woman must marry again, and her family must find her a mate or the husband's brother must step forward and marry her. And all the property now becomes his, you know ... because she can't function on her own without her husband? She might be glad to have the first time to be able to roll without him. But here she is now being passed on. So she doesn't even count. It's her and her property gets taken over to this next person. All these kinds of situations, you know. So in that kind of an atmosphere, you're not necessarily ... not very likely there're going to be a lot of women's centers or battered women's shelters, rape crisis centers, you know, or even kind of support groups that are organizable in an informal way or organized in a more clandestine way, like the Jane Collective used to exist, you know, in different ways. So the idea of being able to have these women ... and then of course in some places, there are centers and there are things, and I guess a lot ... maybe they come out of areas where there are universities, where women have resources at the university level and where the women maybe have more education or something like that. But to be able to kind of work to bring some of that together, so people can create their own, in the way that it's going to work where they are, where they live ... to be able to do that, I think that would be a really good thing, interesting and exciting, whatever, very helpful, for sure. ROSS: So you see your future work helping women in other countries deal with the consequences of rape being used as a weapon of war? Taking your experiences from building the movement to end violence against women here and globalizing it from the perspective of women of color? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I see it as something to think about. I mean, the way you just articulated it, you made it sound so good. I mean, the way you articulated it, it sounded really, really, really good and it sounded really organized ... ROSS: Well, I don't want to put words in your mouth. I'm just trying ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, I'm saying, the way you said it, that's what it is, but I mean, I didn't say it like that. So I'm saying, you know, the way you said it, it sounds really good, the way you said it. It even sounds fundable, the way you said it.
1282	Toure, Nkenge	SCVF	1951	1950	MD	Black or African American	9th to 12th grade but no diploma	Divorced	2	2004.0	53	We are a service-oriented organization. We do education in the schools and we provide counseling. That's what we do, you know. And we go out and speak at the functions in the community, and raise the consciousness at other institutions, and when I'm saying raise the consciousness, what I actually mean is being made aware of the issues around sexual assault and how to deal with them. And that was pretty much becoming it. So, between board micro-management, not continuing to forge out and make those connections, losing many of the women of color because the issues that would keep the connections were not there, so we were coming to a place of ideological differences and being totally burnt out, because I worked like a Mississippi slave in a cotton field in those years when I worked at the Rape Crisis Center, that I served my community. I was just nuked. I just couldn't ... it was time for me to go.	TOURÃƒÂ‰: I left the Rape Crisis Center in August of 1988. To say burnt out is not adequate. It does not begin to describe ... I like to say I was nuked. I was nuked. I just could not ... it had been 13 years, and the last five years of that time had really been ... the last four years of it had really been a lot of battling. A lot of things had changed in the Crisis Center, in the women's movement, in the movement against violence against women. As organizations were striving for the dollars, for the funds, then out came the cry of professionalism. We must be professional. So the whole look and feel of the various centers and shelters began to change. The collective ... the idea of collective running and sharing of responsibilities and those sorts of things, were falling to the side, that seeming need to conform without seeing that at the time, the more we conform, the more we were required to conform, and the more we conformed, the more we were required to conform. And so, you had situations in some places where people who had previously been the executive directors were asked to step down because they were lesbian, they were too radical, they didn't fit the image for a professional. The boards of directors became more professional, and please understand me, there's nothing wrong with being [professional] organizers. It's a matter of what you define professionalism as being. When it becomes such that you are not just dealing with policy, but you are taking the policy in a direction that's basically the opposite of where it has been, or when you begin to micromanage staff, you begin to have problems. You have a lot of problems. ROSS: Would you define as being more or less feminist, the professionalism? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Less feminist. To me, less feminist. ROSS: Why? What would you define that? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I would say, because it became less political and more social-service oriented. You know, provide the services. And of course, there's got to be services. I mean, what's the ... you need a hotline. You need companions to go to the clinic or the hospital and be able to be there. You need the hospital to agree to allow you have a room there in the hospital where you all can function out of. But when, OK, during that time when more people and more ideas came into the Center -- you had asked the question earlier about making connections with other issues and other movements. That was a period of blossoming, when all that was the kind of ... those kinds of things were going on very strongly, like between '80 and '85, '86 [connections between community organizing, the involvement and leadership of women of color, links with other groups and issues]. But around '85 and '86, the connections begin to be disconnected. Stay in your area, you know, this is rape, you know, this is to provide education for the children, talk to people about incest, have incest-survivor groups, have rape-support groups. What does that have to do with the rape of women in Haiti? We're in Washington, D.C. We're in the United States. What does that have to do with the worker rights of women employees who clean buildings? I mean, connections were no longer made. They were not being encouraged. In fact, they were basically discouraged. They may not have been discouraged totally by saying, like, we're just not dealing with that. But if it doesn't get dealt with, if no one wants to talk about it, no one wants to plan around it, no one supports it, it's not getting dealt with. The connections are not getting made. And that was very much happening, that kind of moving away from making the interconnections. We are a service-oriented organization. We do education in the schools and we provide counseling. That's what we do, you know. And we go out and speak at the functions in the community, and raise the consciousness at other institutions, and when I'm saying raise the consciousness, what I actually mean is being made aware of the issues around sexual assault and how to deal with them.

As I recall, there was, in 1970 or '71, there was this big women's speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the women's movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillen's apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My Sister's Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power. All the things that everyone criticized women for having as part of an analysis of violence against women ... who now, the mainstream themselves, embrace a large part of that ideology or that perspective, that politic, or that analysis, however you want to say it, about that, that they didn't do before, Post Traumatic Stress [Disorder], you know, rape trauma syndrome, just any number of things that the women were saying in '72, '73, '74 went on for so long, that the more traditional society, law enforcement, medical, social, was rejecting all of that, have now had to come around and embrace it. And not just embrace it, but kind of like take it over and claim it, like this was their thinking, their theory, all along and all the time, which was just so outrageous, such revisionist history. In that house, in that apartment on Q Street, and it stayed there in Jackie's apartment for some time. And from Jackie's apartment, the first place it went was to that small, two-room across the street from Lincoln Junior High School on 16th and Irvin Street. ROSS: OK. There were some feminist magazines, and wasn't there a group called the D.C. Area Feminists Alliance? TOURÃƒÂ‰: FAAR. ROSS: Feminist [Alliance] Against Rape. Tell me about FAAR and ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, FAAR was ... some of the women in FAAR were from the Rape Crisis Center who had left the Rape Crisis Center, wanted to do something else or do some things differently, and so there were people who were interested in publishing, and they got interested because there was also a quarterly scholarly magazine called Quest. Quest preceded FAAR, you know, because it was more scholarly, a quarterly and all that. So you had women who worked on Quest who were interested in putting some focus around rape and so forth, and you had women who had been at the Rape Crisis Center who had an interest in putting out written materials and educating in that way, so they got FAAR magazine. The thing I'm trying to remember, because it had two incarnations, as FAAR and as Aegis magazine. And actually, what I think is that they became FAAR the collective. The magazine was Aegis magazine, and it carried articles and information on sexual assault and theory around sexual assault, you know, all kinds of tips, this, that, the other, different stuff, stories, articles that had to do with empowering women and all of that. Later, Aegis joined with ... oh, yes, and of course, dealing with pornography as well. Later, Aegis joined with domestic violence and half the magazine would deal with issues related to sexual assault, pornography, and the other half would deal with issues dealing with battering and domestic violence. ROSS: Did you get the sense that in the early years, the people at the Rape Crisis Center worked on other forms of violence that women experienced, or was it just gender-based violence? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It was gender-based violence. However, definitely gender based, although the Center did recognize that it was possible for a man to be raped, it was obviously not the primary focus, but there was certainly the acknowledgment that men could be sexually assaulted. You had individuals who worked at the enter who may have had involvement and ties into other movements around other issues, but the Crisis Center was strictly dealing with rape and had its hands full to deal with that, because in '72 and '75, I mean, the police, everybody, I mean, it was a battle. You know, if we ... it still continues to be a struggle, you know, but it was a battle. It was a war, you know, in terms of they didn't want you to have companions. I mean, all rape crisis centers, now you can have a companion with the woman at the hospital that's from the center. So, Oh, no, you couldn't do that. They didn't want you there because you impeded the investigation by being there. So then it was, like, the only way you could be there was if the woman requested that you be there. I mean, it was all these things, you know. Women asked for it. It was just horrendous. So they weren't just dealing ... they were not really making connections to anything else. They were dealing with the dynamics of gender, you know, and as time moves forward, began to ... around different issues, make connections, broaden out ... ROSS: OK. Now, you're saying that your working at the Rape Crisis Center affected your marriage. In what way did your consciousness that you developed at the Center cause you to re-look at your marriage? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It wasn't working at the Rape Crisis Center that caused me to ... I didn't need Rape Crisis Center. I mean, in all honesty, I didn't need the Rape Crisis Center to help me with that at all. When I was saying, working, I meant working in terms of the finances of it. You know, where if the man doesn't have a regular job or steady job and you do even just part-time, full-time, whatever it is, the dynamics that that creates. No, it wasn't a consciousness from the Rape Crisis Center. It was just the consciousness of, you got to go, because somebody's going to get hurt, OK. And so, I ain't fit for it to be me, so, and you're not leaving my child no place else, so you got to go.	OK. As I recall, there was, in 1970 or '71, there was this big women's speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the women's movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillen's apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My Sister's Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power.

ROSS: And Joanne Little killed a prison guard, did she not? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, I said Dessie Woods. ROSS: But I'm saying ... Joanne's case. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes, yes, who tried to rape her when she was in prison, yes. So these four cases ... Dessie Woods, Joanne Little, Inez Garcia, Yvonne Wanrow, were cases that raised national attention and brought out a lot of the contradictions, the conflict, you know, was played out and so, it was a very educational process for people who were paying attention.	"TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, there were some exciting things, because I always looked at it that there was the overall women's movement and within the overall women's movement, there was the women-of-color movement, because over time, many of the women of color had found ways to network and get to know each other and meet each other and do things. One of the things that we were involved in before we were even really very much involved in NCASA [National Committee Against Sexual Assault] was NCADV, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which was much more radical in its thinking and its approach than was the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault. And within NCADV, they had those women of color caucuses, which was so very strong. All of the women, they had the black caucus, the Latina, the Asian, the First Nation, they had all of the ... women of color had caucuses. Well, you know, NCADV was a national organization, so most of the shelters of the country were members of it, and you could see that there were many women of color working in all these shelters, and in crisis centers, which was like something that people just didn't seem to know and didn't seem to get, that there was all this strength here, and [NCADV], they produced a newsletter, as well as doing a women's newsletter. Some of the shelters did their newsletters, and the women-of-color caucus had a newsletter, and it was very powerful. And what I always appreciated about them was how they could meet as individual groupings and then come back together strong as a women-of-color caucus. So women of color were involved in the shelters, in the rape crisis centers, in the health movement ... because they were also working in the health centers, working with women's health care ... there were a number of cases going on from the 70s into the early 80s that raised a lot of consciousness about violence against women, and those cases were raised and that consciousness was raised through women of color. You had Inez Garcia, who was the Latino woman who was imprisoned for killing a man who was trying to assault her. You had Yvonne Wanrow, who was a Native American sister who, her batterer ... she killed her batterer. You had Joanne Little. You had Dessie Woods, who was a case out of the South of a white insurance salesman who had picked her up to give her a ride who raped her and she killed him. These cases ... ROSS: And Joanne Little killed a prison guard, did she not? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, I said Dessie Woods. ROSS: But I'm saying ... Joanne's case.

And it was signi
icant that these cases, which did so much to further the movement, because it certainly increased ten-fold the dialogue around self-defense, you know, and the right of a woman to self-defense, all of these things. Women of color cases, bringing this to the attention of the nation and of the movement."

(long hearty laugh). Really, I think I did. I thought, God, no wonder. No wonder this and no wonder that, after what I grew up in, you know. And you began to filter that through. This is an example. I remember Harold, all the time we were working I worked in Hanover and he worked in White River, and he would come over, and I would walk down from Hanover and sit on the New Hampshire side of the Ledyard Bridge at the Connecticut River and he would have to come over and pick me up because I wouldn't walk across that bridge. I was deathly scared of walking across bridges with water underneath them. It was all right if they didn't have water underneath it. And I never knew why, never could figure out why, and one time, I remember I came in and he had dropped me off in Vermont. And Harold said, Well, how are you going to get across? I said, Oh, I can do it now. Because I had remembered a time when my father tried to drown me when I was like a year and a half or so old. He was giving me a bath and he was fondling me and I was protesting it and so, he'd stick me under the water, stick my head under the water, and I almost ... I couldn't breathe. And once I remembered that and dealt with that happening and dealt with that fear, I can walk across bridges with water under them all the time now. And I said that to Andy. I said, You know, I wanted to just stand there, walk back and forth, back and forth across that bridge. And he says, Well, that probably would've been all right. They'd have just brought you here anyways. (laugh) And that's the different things that you learn that have stuck with you from what happened to you when you were a child, have come up and you deal with them, and then those fears go away. I could never figure out why I didn't want to stay home alone, and there were times when I would not. I would have someone come stay with me or I'd go stay with someone, and it was all because of the fear of what went on in the nighttime, which is when my father usually abused us. And now, you work through that and I can stay in fine by myself. FOLLET: Uh, huh. WARD: You know, you just work through those things. What it did at that time was [phone rings, voice in background], it allowed me to have respect for myself, to have empathy that I didn't have before, so that was good. FOLLET: Yeah. Um, - WARD: It was about that time, too, that we left from New England and started going cross-country on the trucks and it was after we had dealt with my father. No, let me think. No, that was '93. Oh, and see, we were on the road again, and that was when my niece revealed that she had been abused by my brother. And so during those years I had been doing all this research and so on and learning about child abuse and learning about families, incestuous families and so on (phone rings in background) and so again, the family all turned to me.

So we were each operating a truck, and we had done that some, because we had three trucks at the time, so we took on a lot. We had a little trucking business of our own. And so, there were times when I would operate the truck by myself, and it allowed me to think, I think. You know, you're by yourself then and so on. And of course in '89, that was two years, I think, after my niece had revealed that my father had sexually abused her. And at that point in time, I still wouldn't admit even to myself that we had ... that I had been abused. I just said, it didn't happen in my family. Yeah, it happened to other people, but it didn't happen to me. It might have even happened to my older sister or whatever. It happened to some of the others, but I'm sure it didn't happen to me. And I just ... it was one of those things where if you don't allow yourself to think about it, you just say, I'm not going to think about it. I'm not going to think about, that it goes back further enough in your brain so that you don't think about it and you just ... it's like it's a cutoff there. And I say a cutoff, it was almost like there was a curtain drawn there, and yo
 don't draw that curtain back. Because if you do, God forbid. And that's what it was like. And then, it was almost like when I started to look at what was behind that curtain, there was just like a flood of stuff that came out. And that was all the stuff that I had just stored back there, and had chosen not to talk about it or not even think about for years, since I had left home as a child, really since the time I had been 13 or so. I just, you just don't think about it. It was very easy to do all those years, I think, because there was so much else going on. Harold and I were married and we had his family to think about because his father died. And then my family expected me to solve all of their problems. Whenever anything went wrong, they came to Wynona to solve the problems, and the same with Harold's family. They came to him. So it was just ... you know, it was ... there was so much other going on. Then we had the trucks and we were on road and I ran the business, essentially. And I ran the business side of it and Harold did the mechanical side and ran that part of it. And then we shared the driving. So our lives were really, really hectic and busy. And at that point in time, I think I felt safe enough and secure enough, and was with Harold enough at that point in time so that I could be comfortable and talk about it, and really re-live some of the stuff that went on. And it was a hard time. But it brought Harold and I really close. FOLLET: It did? WARD: Oh, yeah. Because he was there. He was like my everyday shrink, someone that could ... was further enough away from it so it was like he could be almost an objective person about it. Not really, because in some ways, but in other ways he could be. In other ways, he could confirm things for me, too, because he'd known me since I was 13. FOLLET: Right. WARD: I remember when I went to the doctor about whether I had a learning disability or not and I came home and said she wanted me to think about back when I was kid, you know, where there some things I was behind in developing. And I said, You've known me since I was 13. What do you think? And he has this dry sense of humor, so he said, Well, you've always been a klutz. (laugh). And it's true. And it's more than likely because of the learning disability that I have, which was caused from domestic violence. My balance isn't good. It's never been good. And I have a hard time with that. And so it's things like that that he has seen and realized about me, that others wouldn't have known, because he's known me for so long. But at that time, yeah, that's when I really started thinking about it and studying about it and reading about it and realizing that this is what happened in our family. And of course, when my niece revealed that she'd been abused by my father and we went through that whole ordeal, then it was like my sisters and I were really close for a while, a period there, and then we just all pulled apart and went our own separate ways because it was so hard to deal with, so hard to deal with. And they had their families and I was on the road and all of that, and it was very, very difficult to deal with. And they didn't want to deal with it. Nobody wanted to deal with it anymore. Just the same thing as always had happened in the past -- put in on the back burner, it'll go away and it won't happen again. But I didn't let that happen. Instead, I delved into it, and I really wanted to find out what it was all about, and so I did a lot of research on my own. And this was before I was at Vermont College. Whether it was in a bookstore, because when we were hauling different loads, we were in the cities and so on and I could go to a bookstore or wherever and research a lot like that, or could buy books from on the road, and had time to read on the road, where they didn't and they didn't want to deal with it, and so I could pick up these books and read different books about it. I read Judith Lewis Herman's book Father-Daughter Incest. I read Carol Gilligan. I read her book and different books like that I was reading. That's when, I think, how I got my first look at feminism and women and that type of thing was through those books, through Carol Gilligan and Judith Lewis Herman, really. And they were on my own, when I was on the road at that point in time. And I wasn't doing it for school, I was just doing it for myself. The Courage to Heal book, I read that then. Other books about child abuse, and feminist books then, too -- Gloria Steinem and some of those things. I was picking them up and reading them on my own. FOLLET: You were. WARD: Yeah, while we were on the road. FOLLET: Do you remember any ah-hah moments of particular books or particular ideas that really hit home? WARD: Well, of course, Judith Lewis Herman's book Father-Daughter Incest was oh, my God, this is our family. You know, I really think I was at Vermont College before I really started talking about a lot of it. FOLLET: Hm. You talked to Howard, I mean Harold. Sorry. You talked to Harold and you did reading on your own. Did you seek any assistance or- WARD: When things got difficult and I was going through some of the childhood stuff, I saw a psychiatrist for about eight months or so, whenever I could. It was kind of once a week but not really. And just around the psychological stuff of what's going on and how do I handle this and I don't want to see my mother and father anymore and confronting them about what went on and so on, and saw him for about that length of time. And the rest of it was really on my own. I had a friend in California who had ... she had gotten a lot into feminism and that type of thing and so different articles and so on she would refer to me and I would read them, and really started researching on my own on it. FOLLET: At that point, as you started to come"	"drive for us, and he couldn't drive for some reason, he was sick or something. So we were each operating a truck, and we had done that some, because we had three trucks at the time, so we took on a lot. We had a little trucking business of our own. And so, there were times when I would operate the truck by myself, and it allowed me to think, I think. You know, you're by yourself then and so on. And of course in '89, that was two years, I think, after my niece had revealed that my father had sexually abused her. And at that point in time, I still wouldn't admit even to myself that we had ... that I had been abused. I just said, it didn't happen in my family. Yeah, it happened to other people, but it didn't happen to me. It might have even happened to my older sister or whatever. It happened to some of the others, but I'm sure it didn't happen to me. And I just ... it was one of those things where if you don't allow yourself to think about it, you just say, I'm not going to think about it. I'm not going to think about, that it goes back further enough in your brain so that you don't think about it and you just ... it's like it's a cutoff there. And I say a cutoff, it was almost like there was a curtain drawn there, and yo
 don't draw that curtain back. Because if you do, God forbid. And that's what it was like. And then, it was almost like when I started to look at what was behind that curtain, there was just like a flood of stuff that came out. And that was all the stuff that I had just stored back there, and had chosen not to talk about it or not even think about for years, since I had left home as a child, really since the time I had been 13 or so. I just, you just don't think about it. It was very easy to do all those years, I think, because there was so much else going on. Harold and I were married and we had his family to think about because his father died. And then my family expected me to solve all of their problems. Whenever anything went wrong, they came to Wynona to solve the problems, and the same with Harold's family. They came to him. So it was just ... you know, it was ... there was so much other going on. Then we had the trucks and we were on road and I ran the business, essentially. And I ran the business side of it and Harold did the mechanical side and ran that part of it. And then we shared the driving. So our lives were really, really hectic and busy. And at that point in time, I think I felt safe enough and secure enough, and was with Harold enough at that point in time so that I could be comfortable and talk about it, and really re-live some of the stuff that went on. And it was a hard time. But it brought Harold and I really close. FOLLET: It did? WARD: Oh, yeah. Because he was there. He was like my everyday shrink, someone that could ... was further enough away from it so it was like he could be almost an objective person about it. Not really, because in some ways, but in other ways he could be. In other ways, he could confirm things for me, too, because he'd known me since I was 13. FOLLET: Right. WARD: I remember when I went to the doctor about whether I had a learning disability or not and I came home and said she wanted me to think about back when I was kid, you know, where there some things I was behind in developing. And I said, You've known me since I was 13. What do you think? And he has this dry sense of humor, so he said, Well, you've always been a klutz. (laugh). And it's true. And it's more than likely because of the learning disability that I have, which was caused from domestic violence. My balance isn't good. It's never been good. And I have a hard time with that. And so it's things like that that he has seen and realized about me, that others wouldn't have known, because he's known me for so long. But at that time, yeah, that's when I really started thinking about it and studying about it and reading about it and realizing that this is what happened in our family. And of course, when my niece revealed that she'd been abused by my father and we went through that whole ordeal, then it was like my sisters and I were really close for a while, a period there, and then we just all pulled apart and went our own separate ways because it was so hard to deal with, so hard to deal with. And they had their families and I was on the road and all of that, and it was very, very difficult to deal with. And they didn't want to deal with it. Nobody wanted to deal with it anymore. Just the same thing as always had happened in the past -- put in on the back burner, it'll go away and it won't happen again. But I didn't let that happen. Instead, I delved into it, and I really wanted to find out what it was all about, and so I did a lot of research on my own. And this was before I was at Vermont College. Whether it was in a bookstore, because when we were hauling different loads, we were in the cities and so on and I could go to a bookstore or wherever and research a lot like that, or could buy books from on the road, and had time to read on the road, where they didn't and they didn't want to deal with it, and so I could pick up these books and read different books about it. I read Judith Lewis Herman's book Father-Daughter Incest. I read Carol Gilligan. I read her book and different books like that I was reading. That's when, I think, how I got my first look at feminism and women and that type of thing was through those books, through Carol Gilligan and Judith Lewis Herman, really. And they were on my own, when I was on the road at that point in time. And I wasn't doing it for school, I was just doing it for myself. The Courage to Heal book, I read that then. Other books about child abuse, and feminist books then, too -- Gloria Steinem and some of those things. I was picking them up and reading them on my own. FOLLET: You were. WARD: Yeah, while we were on the road. FOLLET: Do you remember any ah-hah moments of particular books or particular ideas that really hit home? WARD: Well, of course, Judith Lewis Herman's book Father-Daughter Incest was oh, my God, this is our family. You know, I really think I was at Vermont College before I really started talking about a lot of it. FOLLET: Hm. You talked to Howard, I mean Harold. Sorry. You talked to Harold and you did reading on your own. Did you seek any assistance or- WARD: When things got difficult and I was going through some of the childhood stuff, I saw a psychiatrist for about eight months or so, whenever I could. It was kind of once a week but not really. And just around the psychological stuff of what's going on and how do I handle this and I don't want to see my mother and father anymore and confronting them about what went on and so on, and saw him for about that length of time. And the rest of it was really on my own. I had a friend in California who had ... she had gotten a lot into feminism and that type of thing and so different articles and so on she would refer to me and I would read them, and really started researching on my own on it.

1315	Ward, Wynona	SCVF	1951	1950	VT	Two or More Races	Graduate or professional degree	Married (except if separated)		2004.0	53	WARD: When I was ... summer between my second and third year in law school, I worked at the attorney general's office and worked in their child protection agency team there. W had a conference and it was on internet child pornography and how they were prosecuting that. I think that was in 1997, the summer of '97, how we were beginning to be able to prosecute child porn and so on. And I think that it's really important that we realize that that's out there and that it can affect our children, and that it can be devastating for them, especially when you hear of -- whether it's older men or older women who will get on the internet with these young people and pretend that they're a young person and come meet me and then you hear of children being killed or raped or the circumstance that happens from that type of connection to pornography. In the same voice, -- and this stems from my law school education, I think, too -- in one of my last cases, it was brought up because he had porn in his house and he was an abuser, and we mentioned it, and that he was showing it to his 6year-old son as if this was an accepted way of life, and we brought it up as a fact that it was not an acceptable parenting skill, that that showed that he did not have any parenting skills. So I've used it that way as such, but I also realize that the Constitution gives adults the right to observe and look at porn as part of the Constitution. Do you see what I mean? And so you get that battle going back and forth. Personally, I feel that if women are looked at as sexual, their bodies are just looked at as sexual bodies, then you're not thinking about their mind, you're not thinking about their worth, you're not thinking about what they can give to society or a relationship, or, you know, that type of thing. So I think we could do without it without any problem. I wouldn't hesitate at all to use it in my cases if this was ... and I have already done it, that this shows an inappropriate parenting skill, if that's what was happening, if they were being shown to children. And I think as far as bringing children into that, and that type of thing, it's terrible and it needs to be stopped, just the same as child abuse needs to be stopped. Child porn is part of child abuse.

1317	Ward, Wynona	SCVF	1951	1950	VT	Two or More Races	Graduate or professional degree	Married (except if separated)		2004.0	53	WARD: And it did. I remember when Stop It Now! first came to Vermont, it was not respected because they felt that, oh, here we have someone on the abuser's side, the batterer's side, and the whole idea of the domestic violence movement then was you get the victims out, including the mothers and the children, and you send the perpetrators to jail. And that's the solution. And when someone had a solution besides that, then it was wrong. But I think what a lot of that stemmed from was the fact that at that time it was still very common in the legal system and in society to blame the victim, and that it was the victim's fault. And so many times, even today, when I speak, a hand will raise and they'll say, Well, why doesn't she leave? or, Why does she go back? or, Why does she stay? SO I will logically go through all of the ... there is an actual chart that I have with a circle, like the power-and-control wheel, but it's why she stays, and around it will be the psychological reasons, the children, the economic reasons that we've already talked about it, the legal reasons ... he gets a pat on the hand and that's it and don't do that again, and the family reasons and the religious reasons and all of that, the logical reasons, and then I will say, and I'll flash on the screen with my Power Point and I'll say, But isn't the real question why does he beat her? Because when you're asking why does he beat her, you're asking for the batterer to take accountability for what he does, instead of putting the onus on her, that it's her responsibility to leave, it's her responsibility to get out, it's her responsibility to stop the violence. And so because that went on for so many years, and still goes on, I think, like in rape cases, where they blame the victim, they put the victim on the stand and abuse her all over again, which can happen in domestic violence cases, too, domestic assault cases. And because of that, there was that staunch feminist movement that said, What the solution to this problem is, is get them out and put the abuser in jail. But I think at the same time, as that was a solution at the time. That was one of the solutions at the time. But as society has looked at the whole problem and realized that, yes, that's part of the solution, but if you look at it from a family systems theory point of view, or from just a logical point of view, you take them away from that but then he's going to seek out others to do the same because you haven't done anything to change him. And so, I think the pendulum has swung now and that a lot of the domestic violence movement as such is to help the batterer, to get him treatment and so on.	WARD: And it did.

My mother and my grandmother both -- my maternal grandmother. When I speak of my grandmother, for the most part, it's my maternal grandmother. We had very little to do with my paternal grandmother because she lived at that time what we felt was a long distance away. It was about 40 miles away, so. Of course, that was a long way away then. But my maternal grandmother lived just two miles away. And they made it very clear to all of us that you do not talk about this, that this is shameful, that it's bad, that it only happens to you. We didn't talk about it to one another within the household, what went on, because it was supposed to be kept a secret and it was the divide-and-conquer, which is very common with incestuous families, what happens. So we never talked about it. We didn't discuss it. It was just understood that you don't bring friends home, and mothers in the neighborhood knew that, they wouldn't allow their children in our house. They knew what went on. I was welcome to go to other girls' houses and stay overnight but we were never allowed to bring friends home. And not because my mother wouldn't allow it, it was because other mothers wouldn't allow it. FOLLET: Because they knew. WARD: They knew. You just didn't discuss it. FOLLET: Did you have-? WARD: It was understood. It was almost like it was an understood, unspoken way of life. FOLLET: So you had exposure to other families or to other messages that made you think of your own family situation as having something wrong going on? WARD: Oh, yeah. Wrong or something that wasn't ... yes, it would have been wrong, not accepted by others, not OK with others, shameful, very shameful. So you hid it and you didn't discuss it. And it was like black and white. I've often said with children, what children learn, if a child grows up in a home and is told all their life that black is white and then they go to school and they're told, no, white is black, they're going to adjust and know that at school that they have to say white is black. But when they go home at night, they know that black is white and you just adjust. You go back and forth. It's no different than children that go back and forth between divorced families. You learn the rules at each place, and you learn, in a divorced family, you learn that at dad's house you eat at 6 o'clock, and at mom's house you eat at 8:30. And this is no different.

I recently said, and this is an example, to an opposing client who has finally admitted that he abused his wife and is going into a batterer's intervention program, and we were dealing with supervised visitation for this child, and I said to him, When you get into your batterer's group, you talk with your facilitator. I will be happy to come. Because he was trying to say that the child was only 2 when the battering went on and she didn't really see any of it. So I said, I remember back, vividly, when I was 2 years old and there was abuse going on in my family. And when you get into your group, you ask your facilitator if I can come and talk to you in your group so that you will know what it feels like to be a child and have your parents abusing one another, I said, or to have your father beating your mother. I said, I will be happy to come and talk to you about that and read to yo
 some of my writings about what that experience is like. I said, Then you will know what it's like to be a child and know what it feels like to be abused and how traumatic and how frightening it is. Because I think that is the way, if I can reach people with that message, that they will realize that it has to stop, that it can't continue on, because if it does, then that's what we're doing to our future generations that we expect to take care of us and expect to take care of the world. So I think it's very important. I often say we will not stop street violence and we will not stop school violence until we stop violence in the home. Because as I said to you yesterday, even though things go on at school that you know are not acceptable at school and they're acceptable at home, deep down inside you learn that it's acceptable anywhere, and you can bring it from the home into the school and onto the streets and so if you can stop it in the home, I think that's the key to where it all starts. And, you know, if - the whole idea that women need to be equal with men and can be equal with men. One of the things that has always turned me against the Bible and against religion is that my father would quote from the Bible while he was, you know, the next minute abusing my mother or abusing one of his daughters, as if he were supported by the Bible for doing this, and would turn it all around. So for a long time I was against the teachings of the Bible, but now, I can look at it more objectively and realize that yes, it's very patriarchal, especially the Old Testament, which is what he would quote from, but now I can look at it and realize that that was the way he interpreted it. FOLLET: Did he quote actual passage to justify actual abuse? WARD: He would ... well, you read the Bible. Nowhere in the Bible does it prohibit father-daughter incest.

1323	Ward, Wynona	SCVF	1951	1950	VT	Two or More Races	Graduate or professional degree	Married (except if separated)		2004.0	53	WARD: By that time I had read about it and I knew what it was about, and when this happened, I said, This has to stop. I said this to myself. I said this to my niece, to my sisters, to Harold, to my sister's husbands, to anybody that I could talk to. This has to stop. It cannot keep going on. It happened to me, it happened to you, it happened to you, it happened to you. This has to stop now. [speaks with emphasis, points finger] And that's what propelled me into helping that case. The only way this is going to stop, I had researched that. I looked up a lot of stuff. How do I get help for Richie, my brother? He has to stop this. He has to get help. You know, I didn't see him as being a culprit or being a criminal. I know he was, there's no question he was, and there's no question my father was, but I saw it as a sickness. And everybody in the family did. And so I said, The only way he's going to get help, from what I've read -- I had read Salter, Anna Salter's book Treating Child Sex Offenders and Victims -- and the only way he's going to get help is to go to prison. That's where he's going to get help, and he's going to get in-house treatment that way. Otherwise, he's never going to get help. So I said, We have to put him in jail. And my sister wanted him punished, because he had abused her and then he had abused her daughter, and, you know, she really ... she wanted him to get help but at the same time, this is wrong, he needs to be punished. So that really propelled me after that to want to do something else. And we had this friend. Her daughter had been sexually abused. She had gone through SRS [Social Rehabilitative Services] and gotten a divorce, and she'd been sexually abused by her father and so through a mutual friend, we were talking, and she said she was working ... and she had gotten her BA and she said, You know, there's this is Vermont College. You can go there weekends if you want, but I think they've got something where you don't have to go but a couple of times a year, and you could finish then. So I said, Oh, all right. So I called and got information on it. She wrote me a recommendation. Another friend wrote me a recommendation, and I got in. And that's when ... when I went to Vermont College, I think that's when I really got exposed to feminism as such. I got exposed to more of Judith Lewis Herman, to more of Carol Gilligan. I did child development and started with some of the women's, the way women look at -- Mary Belensky, Women's Ways of Knowing. All of those books like that were written. Alice Eichholz, who was my professor and was about my age, a little bit younger, had me read all these books, (Harold's voice in background) and that's, I think, when my eyes opened up as to how unequal things are between men and women and how unequal they've been. That's when it really opened my eyes to that. And, I realized when my niece's case was going on, that if we hadn't had a woman judge, and specifically the woman judge that we had, it might not have turned out the way it did.

My sisters speak openly, my younger sisters, about what happened to them and how wrong it was and how traumatic it was. And they talk amongst their friends or with me or other professionals or whatever. But they're not a public spokesman for it like I am. But they support me. They've heard me speak and listened and have participated in some of the efforts that I have made, whether it's interviewing with reporters or, you know, just giving information and so on. And so they've been helpful. But their lives focus around their children's lives.

I don't know if it's because they have children and that has to be their everyday focus. But, in the same instance, I'll tell you that one of my nieces -- she will be here tomorrow, she's meeting a client here, a mutual client, and asking that I represent the children in the case where there has been child sexual abuse. And so that niece is out there working. She works in a child psychology type position, a case manager position for one of the local mental health centers in the area, so she is actively out there and she has three children, but she's actively out there in this area. I have another niece who, in New Jersey, works with the elderly now in nursing homes and so on and does a lot to make sure that the elderly aren't abused. Now that's a niece that my nephew married. It's not a direct blood relation, but ... so there are people in my family that go into the social service area and I think a lot of that is because they see the need and realize ... as the generations come down, even though that generation was not abused, they're still affected by it. You know, just like you talk about the Holocaust. One of my best friends, she's a doctor in Ann Arbor ... her mother was a victim of the Holocaust. So she wasn't, but it affects her still.

When I was a senior resident at Harvard, I spent half of my time at Harvard Student Health Services. I'd only seen very, very, very mentally ill patients [in my residency education at the state hospital]. I was interested in working with healthy lesbian and gay people and helping them with their [internalized] homophobia. Having a lot of expertise in how to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder and so on really wasn't going to be helpful to me in terms of dealing with healthier people with run-of-the-mill problems. I wanted to work with healthier people. I applied for and was accepted for doing part of my senior residency at Harvard Student Health Services. My supervisor there was Paul Walters. It became clear to me that he was doing something that wasn't okay while I was there. This was 1979. He was an analyst. He had a sofa in his office. It was a dark blue sofa. It had stains all over it. For supervision I met in there. I sat in the chair and when all the residents met in there, we sat all around. I always was trying to get the chair rather than the sofa. [I noticed that when he saw] patients, they seemed to stay for a very long period of time. It just felt creepy. Those were my observations. I started doing the research on sex abuse by psychiatrists. We had two people from Harvard School of Public Health whom we were working with, and through other people at the Harvard School of Public Health and my networking around Harvard, I met some people who worked at the Harvard Risk Management Foundation. I don't know if that's a concept that is familiar to people, in general, so I'll just say something about it. Basically, they managed the malpractice claims that came 111 in against Harvard doctors, which meant they shoved them under the rug as much as possible or did payoffs that were private or confidential because nobody wanted bad publicity against Harvard doctors. [00:39:23] I heard from somebody I really trusted, who was a really straight arrow person who worked with the Risk Management Foundation, that a claim had come in against Paul Walters for sexually abusing a Harvard student, having her pay him thirty-five dollars a session, I think it was, for oral sex three times a week as therapy, [and it had somehow been ""taken care of"" by the Risk Management Foundation]. I was already working on sex abuse. That individual said to me, ""If this comes to your attention in any other way""--because this was a breaking of a confidence as a person working with the Risk Management Foundation--""you need to pursue it."" Before I left Harvard, I still had some friends who were on the staff at [Harvard Student] Mental Health Services where he still was. I said to them, ""If you hear anything about Paul Walters behaving sexually inappropriately with students, you need to let me know."" Before I left Harvard to move to California in 1987, he called me. Paul Walters, out of the blue. I had had no contact with him since 1979. Oh, [actually] I had. [Colleagues and I] had done a presentation at the American Psychiatric Association on sexual abuse of patients after we had published the first paper. He was there sitting in the front row. There were a whole collection of people [in that row]. I recognized him, but there were others that none of us recognized sitting in the first row of this huge auditorium. He called me after that and he said he wanted to let me know that he was leaving 112 his position at Harvard, and he was moving to California. Where? To Stanford to become the director of Cowell Student Health Services. I said, ""Oh, well, why are you telling me?"" He said, ""Well, when I was out there, I mentioned that I knew you and that you were one of my supervisees and that you went to Stanford."" Now my work had already been publicized in a big way. I mean, front page stories in the Boston Globe, the sex abuse stuff--the results of the findings. It was clear he had used me in some kind of deceitful way to help get a position at Cowell Student Health Services. I left Harvard. Moved out here. The first year I was here, I got a call from one of the social workers who was still on the faculty at Harvard [Student Health] saying they got an anonymous letter from a woman who made the same claims--$35 an hour, da da da da da. I said, ""Thank you very much. I'm filing a complaint with the Massachusetts Licensing Board and the California Licensing Board. I'm going to inform them."" So I did. Both began a major investigation. The story became front page news out here and in Massachusetts. He left his position at Cowell Student Health Services. He claimed that he had a substance abuse problem, and he tried to get into a diversion program which, if you get in a diversion program, they drop all charges against you--it's a nifty, sneaky loophole for perpetrators. Somehow there was enough publicity around it that they didn't allow him into it. He went underground and was never found again. Every few years I got a call from a San Jose Mercury news reporter who was trying to find him; [the reporter] was pretty convinced that [Walters, who] was from North 113 Carolina, had gone back [there] and changed his name and was working [there]. I actually was very fearful that my name would come out as the person who reported him to the licensing board. All I had done [was to say], ""This has come to my attention. Please investigate and please contact the Harvard Risk Management Foundation and make sure you start your investigation there."" [00:44:40] When they did, the risk management people I guess were obligated to contact Patient A who then said, ""I'm willing to be named,"" which was amazing. So I was never publicly [named] on any of the press about it, which I was very grateful about because I was afraid he was going to come [after me and] kill me--literally. I was afraid because we already knew that psychiatrists who took care of patients who'd been abused--women psychiatrists who took care of patients who had been abused--these were colleagues and friends of mine--had their offices broken into, their offices vandalized, and their records stolen because they were encouraging and supporting these women in filing complaints. The perpetrators were trying to stop the complaints from happening by attacking the subsequent treating women psychiatrists. These were scary times. I was afraid that this guy whose misdeeds I had reported, [resulting in a huge] impact on his career, was going to come after me. Fortunately, I was not [named] by the media but the Patient A contacted me and said, ""I don't know how you found out but it's [been] life-changing for me that you did--in a positive way--and I want to thank you so much for [having done] this."" When it was publicized in Boston, [she was] Patient A, [and subsequently] 114 Patient B, [and] Patient C [and] I don't know how many [others] came forward and were willing to be named on the complaint. That's one horror story. Another is the psychiatrist that my mother saw from the time she was psychiatrically hospitalized and for the next twenty-some years. He was a really creepy guy in Santa Barbara. He too became very prominent in psychiatry. He was president of the [World Association of Social Psychiatry]. His name was John Carleton. I sat outside the waiting room when she had appointments sometimes. As a teenager when I met him, he took my hand. He wanted to show me around the offices, and he kind of fondled my hand in a way that felt totally, totally cr
epy. I was a teenager who was already afraid of inappropriate behavior by men. I wanted to get my hand away, and he was fondling my hand so I was completely creeped out by this guy. I ran into him at some APA meetings, one of which when I was a resident. He got into an elevator and I was standing there with my residency training director at Harvard, and [Carleton] turned to me and he said, ""Well, hi, Nanette. How nice to see you. Your mother told me to say hello."" My mother was his patient. That is the most inappropriate thing in the world to say. That is a total breach of confidentiality. I walk out of the elevator, and my residency training director said, ""Who is he?"" I said, ""My mother's psychiatrist."" I mean, totally embarrassing to me that that had happened. I'd been doing [sex abuse] research. I was already out here. My mother called me a few years after I [moved to San Francisco]. It actually was in the early 1990s. I was working on a big fundraiser for our lesbian health services here 115 in San Francisco, and I had created an idea of a fundraiser that was really successful. I was driving back across the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a time when we had a car phone, and she called me. I said, ""I really can't talk right now. I'm on the bridge."" She said, ""I have something I have to tell you. I know you've been doing all this work all this time [meaning, on sexual abuse] and I know that you never liked Dr. Carleton."" She wanted to tell me--she felt like she had to tell me--that she had been sexually involved with him and when she told him that the relationship needed to stop, he had raped her. She also said, ""He also encouraged me to kill your father."" I was just horrified at all this. ""He encouraged me when we went out sailing to push him overboard. That was before he raped me, before I told him I can't keep seeing him."" [00:49:42] I contacted the California Licensing Board. He had meanwhile married a patient. I don't know how many patients he--I think there were stories of multiple patients--I don't know how many he married, but he married at least one. The only thing I could think of to do was to contact, again, the California Licensing Board, and I sent them this complaint. I asked my mother if she'd be willing to be named on the complaint. I don't remember the circumstances exactly. She had gone through this complicated decision-making process but I said to them, ""You've got to open a file on him. If you get any other complaints, you really need to do something about it."" 116 The third story led to my resignation publicly from the American Psychiatric Association in 1989, during the time that all these women psychiatrists and mental health professionals were providing reparative, supportive therapy to victims of abuse by male typically psychiatrists and other physicians. The APA's malpractice carrier was beginning to realize that they were going to be losing tons of money on these claims. This is before we started our work in this area. They were paying claims based on sexual abuse. Now you can't get any kind of insurance--malpractice coverage--that would cover your sexually abusing a patient. Then they were paying. One of the things that was really a problem for them is that subsequent treating psychiatrists were helping these patients file complaints, which means that the claims were continuing to rise and they were continuing to lose money. They started going after these subsequent treating psychiatrists with character assassination. One of those cases involved this phenomenally strong woman psychiatrist in Colorado whose name is Martha Gay. She was treating a patient who had been sexually abused by a psychiatrist. The establishment came after Martha Gay to character assassinate her and further character assassinate the patient who had filed a claim against her abusing [male] psychiatrist. It was an appalling situation. I went all in in support of Dr. Gay, and I publicly resigned from the APA over the [attempt to malign her character]. That story ended up being a FRONTLINE documentary. I talked about that resignation in the FRONTLINE documentary. Those are just some examples, [and that episode illustrated how one] moved 117 into very dangerous territory [when] working with individuals who were seeking restitution from abuse."	"share regarding this physician abuse? 110 Gartrell: [00:36:25] Yes. When I was a senior resident at Harvard, I spent half of my time at Harvard Student Health Services. I'd only seen very, very, very mentally ill patients [in my residency education at the state hospital]. I was interested in working with healthy lesbian and gay people and helping them with their [internalized] homophobia. Having a lot of expertise in how to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder and so on really wasn't going to be helpful to me in terms of dealing with healthier people with run-of-the-mill problems. I wanted to work with healthier people. I applied for and was accepted for doing part of my senior residency at Harvard Student Health Services. My supervisor there was Paul Walters. It became clear to me that he was doing something that wasn't okay while I was there. This was 1979. He was an analyst. He had a sofa in his office. It was a dark blue sofa. It had stains all over it. For supervision I met in there. I sat in the chair and when all the residents met in there, we sat all around. I always was trying to get the chair rather than the sofa.

1345	Gartrell, Nanette	SHSA	1949	1940	CA	White	Graduate or professional degree	Never married	0	2018.0	69	In fact, when I was at Stanford, for classmates who got involved with faculty members, that was a badge of honor for them because what did they get out of it? They had a ticket to opportunity, for a time. Marine-Street: Was that frequent when you were at Stanford? Gartrell: [00:34:35] I know of circumstances. Frequency--I would not be surprised if it were frequent	"Can we talk a little bit about that now? Gartrell: [00:16:41] Yes, when I became chair of the Committee on Women, my understanding of the responsibility was--this was 1982--to advocate for women's mental health on a national basis. So that if there was a problem related to women's mental health, it was the responsibility of the Committee on Women to figure it out and do something about it. Very soon after I assumed the position, I heard that the number of malpractice claims filed against psychiatrists through the American Psychiatric Association's insurance carrier --they had an insurance carrier at that time--based on allegations of sexual abuse of the patient, were skyrocketing. At that time, we were coming off the 1960s and 1970s, the free love era, [aka] anything goes. There were no ethics codes. There were no licensing board regulations. There were no laws about this. For me and for those on 102 my committee, it was a no-brainer. Your patients are not there for you to have sex with. Your patients come to you because they have psychological difficulties for which they need help. We started looking into this, and we were getting more and more information about this as a potential problem but by then, I was already quite wise to the fact that the APA was [laughter] an institution in which there was a tremendous amount of resistance to change and that it seemed unlikely that we could do anything about the problem that we were hearing about until we had evidence documenting it. I proposed that we put together a questionnaire, and get the APA to agree to send it out to all the psychiatrists in the country and do it in a neutral fashion because, again, there were no ethics codes, there were no laws, there were no licensing board regulations. With nothing in place saying it's not a bad thing, you could just ask the questions in a neutral way and maybe people would answer the questions. Have you been sexually involved with a patient? If you have, how long did the relationship last? Is it still ongoing? Questions like that and then we got a little further into it. Have you been involved with more than one patient? How many patients have you been with and can you tell us how many patients you've been involved with? We put together this questionnaire. We submitted it through the channels, and we were stonewalled by committee after committee after committee that was responsible for approving projects like this. [We were] starting to get accusations like, ""What [are you] trying to do? [You are] going to destroy the credibility of the psychiatric profession."" We were going to destroy the credibility of the 103 psychiatric profession? To us, it seemed as though psychiatrists who were sexually abusing their patients were destroying the credibility of the psychiatric profession. We continued to push forward and said we didn't agree and we wanted to do this survey and we wanted the APA to sponsor it. At a certain point, it became clear that it was re-cycling back through the same committees that had already rejected it. I had brought onto the Committee on Women, Judith Herman, who's my really good friend and colleague, and Silvia Olarte, another psychiatrist. There were other members of the committee who were very much in support of this project. [00:20:54] We decided we would give the APA a deadline. If they didn't approve the project by this deadline, we would do the study ourselves independently. They actually didn't imagine that I could get the mailing labels in order to send out the questionnaire to psychiatrists in the country because this was--again--before everyone had computers in their homes, and they owned the mailing labels for the Psychiatric Association. I don't know how they printed them out when they needed them--I don't remember whether they printed envelopes or labels or what they had. They just figured they'd let the deadline pass and that it was a false statement on my part that I could actually do it independently. But what they didn't know is while we were waiting for the deadline, first of all, I'd contacted two individuals at the Harvard School of Public Health about doing the statistics. And that continuing medical education was beginning to be a booming and profitable industry. So we were starting to get mailings about continuing medical 104 education courses. They were coming through the AMA. I was never a member of the AMA because--talk about organizations that were never progressive enough for me--that was certainly one of them! The AMA was located in Chicago. I contacted the Harvard Continuing Medical Education Office, and I said, ""When you're sending out CME courses, how do you get your mailing labels? Do you have your own?"" They said, ""No, no, we get them through a clearinghouse through the AMA in Chicago."" And they gave me the number. I already had plans to conduct a course on ethics in medicine and in psychiatry and so I had already been kind of thinking along these lines. I contacted this clearinghouse, and I said, ""I'm a Harvard faculty member and I'm planning to do this course and how would I obtain mailing labels?"" I [also asked], ""How many do you have for psychiatrists?"" I think they had 25,000 or something. I said, ""And how much would that cost?"" It was very expensive. Every study that I've done, I've essentially funded myself out of my own earnings. I said, ""Well, could you randomly select every fifth psychiatrist in the country, and how much would that cost?"" And they said, ""Oh yes, it's not a problem."" That was several thousand dollars, but I was willing to pay for it. They said, ""We'll give them to you zip code sequenced, which, as it turned out, is a very big deal because when you're taking things in bulk to the post office, which I did not know previously, you have to put them in bags [that are] zip code sequenced. I got all those arrangements made. The deadline came and passed. I contacted the clearinghouse. I got the labels 105 shipped to me; again, sitting on the floor--always I was seemingly [sitting] on hardwood floors stuffing envelopes after printing out questionnaires. [00:24:16] We had thankfully moved away from mimeograph into being able to have Xerox copies back then. [I spent days] stuffing these envelopes, putting stamps on them, getting them to the post office. We sent them out to every fifth psychiatrist in the country. Officials at the APA went ballistic when some of them received this questionnaire. They thought I had broken into the APA and stolen the labels, gotten into the office and stolen the labels! They had no idea that I could possibly do this without breaking in. I assured them that I had a plan to conduct a course based on the results of the study. They were just apoplectic about this. We got the questionnaires back. We also got some that said things like, ""We believe you have secretly coded these questionnaires, and there is no circumstance in which I would fill it out because I believe you can identify us."" We received back a lot of obscenities and very hostile comments. Leaving aside the obscenities and the blank questionnaires that they sent back that we had to pay the postage on, of course, because they often stuffed them with heavy things so we had to pay more postage, we tabulated our results. Seven percent of psychiatrists acknowledged being sexually involved with their patients and a number of those had been involved with more than one patient. All our publications are available to be read so I'm not going to go into details of numbers. They can be downloaded also--many of them--on our study websites. We then had the issue of publishing the article. The preeminent journal of psychiatry is the American Psychiatric 106 Association's journal, the American Journal of Psychiatry. The editor of that journal was none other than my department chair who wanted me not to use my hospital affiliation and my Harvard affiliation on any of my publications. They did not have anonymous review, of course. One of the things I'd worked on for years was to get medical journals to have anonymous review because all the data that we had showed that if even a single woman was a co-author, the chance of an article being accepted was reduced. We wrote up the first paper and submitted it to the American Journal of Psychiatry. It's standard to send out a manuscript to two reviewers, sometimes three reviewers. He sent it out to seven simultaneous reviewers. We got seven pages-long criticisms of us--not of the study--nothing about the analysis or anything about the legitimacy of the actual research itself. We sat down and typed up [our responses], dutifully responding to every criticism. The one that was most entertaining to us--""These data could not possibly be accurate. There's no way that they could be accurate."" To that one, we responded, ""We completely agree with you. These data are not accurate. They can't even begin to be accurate because they inevitably underrepresent the prevalence of this abuse."" They weren't prepared for that [laughter]. My final statement in our very long, many-page response to these criticisms [that was sent] back to the editor of the journal who happened to be my department chair was, ""We understand if the reviewers and you make a decision that you do not want to publish it, but it's important to let you know that the American Psychological Association's journal has expressed an interest in publishing this article."" Which [would] essentially [be] letting the 107 competitor put out the information about psychiatry. I mean, I didn't say that but that was obvious. Very reluctantly it was published [in the American Journal of Psychiatry]. [00:28:57] We then did a number of follow-up studies including studying senior residents--all senior residents--in terms of their sexual involvement with patients and already there were some who were sexually involved with patients. I heard endlessly from psychiatrists, ""Why don't you survey the other specialties? OB/GYNs, surgeons, family practitioners, internists? Surely they're sexually involved with patients too,"" as if that justified a
ything. When I [joined the UCSF faculty], I gathered colleagues in other fields and, in fact, we did that study too. And, in fact, found [that], yes, indeed, [physicians in other specialties were abusing patients too]. Also from their own assessment of the impact on patients who had been sexually involved with non-psychiatric physicians whom they knew of, that the consequences were always damaging to the patients. We knew from data we had been gathering over the [prior] decade that most patients who were abused by psychiatrists [or other mental health professionals] ended up severely depressed when the relationships terminated, which they did inevitably. Ten percent were psychiatrically hospitalized and one percent committed suicide. We even had people write in things on their questionnaires like, ""You know, I'm not really sure that this involvement is worth the effort. This patient was terribly dysfunctional to begin with and things just got worse after the sexual involvement so I'm not really sure that this is something that I'm going to continue."" This is what we 108 were dealing with. The point of all of this was we had a mission, a mission to establish ethics codes, to have licensing board regulations that made it very clear that sexual involvement with any patient was unacceptable. Our mission [encompassed] any current or former patient. We don't have that in all the regulations, but it has also become a felony in many states. And there are reporting regulations in some states that if you, as a medical professional, hear of another colleague who is involved with a patient, however you hear about it, you're required to report it to the licensing board. We have had a great impact in terms of change. It was a hard-fought battle and a really important one from my perspective, in thinking about the vast number of patients who were severely damaged--[creating] what we call an iatrogenic problem--caused by a medical intervention, which [in this case] was an abuse. Marine-Street: That's just incredible to me that it wasn't part of the code of ethics. When did it finally get into the code of ethics? Do you know? Gartrell: [00:32:00] There were a lot of different changes to the ethics codes, and it's now in the AMA Codes of Ethics. It wasn't part of academic codes of ethics-faculty/students--either. This is all the result of the work that we did in this area [first in] psychiatry and then [in] medicine that it became something that was then [considered] in academia [concerning] faculty and students. I mean, you know, the whole concept of ""they're both adults, it's freedom of choice, it's a consensual relationship""--in medicine, we know what informed consent means and I have said this very clearly since I began this work. Informed consent means you explain the risks and benefits of any [proposed treatment 109 or intervention]. I can assure you there's never been an abusing physician who has explained that ""you have a fifty percent chance of a severe depression, ten percent chance of psychiatric hospitalization, one percent chance of committing suicide as a result of this--your imminent sexual involvement with me. [So] let's go meet at the Holiday Inn."" I mean, does that sound likely? No. Faculty/student involvement, I mean, [it's important to think about] who [holds the power]. We've talked about the all-male or predominately male academic institutions in which I grew up. Many of those individuals themselves likely were either aware of or themselves participating in the abuse of power that we [now] know was rampant. Marine-Street: Just the fact that someone would actually be truthful on the questionnaire and return it to you would seem to indicate that there was some degree of acceptance. Gartrell: [00:34:07] Acceptance because we were just coming off the free love movement when it was [considered] okay. In fact, when I was at Stanford, for classmates who got involved with faculty members, that was a badge of honor for them because what did they get out of it? They had a ticket to opportunity, for a time. Marine-Street: Was that frequent when you were at Stanford? Gartrell: [00:34:35] I know of circumstances. Frequency--I would not be surprised if it were frequent, but my mission was to get us out of the DSM back then."

So two women who were seniors lived there, and they allowed us to use their apartment. It was clear from the very beginning that the conversations were going in the direction of sex and talking about sexual feelings and that was something that seemed to be thrilling to the men to be able to do and felt creepy to me. Early into these meetings, we were told to pair off and there were all those kinds of touchy-feely things that were done back then in group dynamics where you close your eyes and, you know, see what you can communicate to another person through holding their hands like this and things like that. That kind of pairing off, we were given some instructions about that. I found out later that the woman who became my lover, my RA, and the man she was paired off with--what he did was he reached around, undid her bra, and was feeling her breasts during that encounter. That made me feel incredibly freaked out. She didn't complain. She just went along with it. She was sexually involved with men before she became involved with me. I guess, I don't know, some number of sessions later, we arrived and the group leader was on the couch holding the hands and stroking one of the women 33 who lived in the apartment. He said, ""Well, let's resume later."" She went into the bedroom, and we started our meeting and he stopped it after, I don't know, five or ten minutes. And he said, ""You know, I have some unfinished business to do with what's-her-name and so why don't you carry on without me."" We kind of, I don't know, carried on somehow without him. I had to go to the bathroom, and I got up to go to the bathroom, and the door to the room was open and they were having sex. And I, from other women classmates, heard similar stories of power and sex abuse by these people who supposedly represented mental health professionals affiliated with Stanford, which was just appalling. Marine-Street: Was he a student? Gartrell: [00:41:43] No, he was a member of the Counseling and Testing Center staff in the Dean of Students Office at the Old Union. Marine-Street: The girl that he was having sex with was an older student? Gartrell: [00:41:55] Student, yes. She was a senior. Marine-Street: But an undergraduate? Gartrell: [00:41:57] Yes."	"Gartrell: [00:37:33] I'll say something about encounter groups. The summer before we entered Stanford, to my knowledge, every one of us received a letter offering the opportunity to participate in an encounter group when we arrived. It was described as an opportunity to have a member of the Counseling and Testing Center meet with a small group of us to talk about our experiences and to get to know one another well and share things that we might not feel comfortable sharing just in general. But, you know, in a safe environment. I read it. My parents read it. At first I thought, ""Why not, it sounds good."" My parents read it and thought, ""Oh, wow, free therapy. Great. So do it."" I signed up to do it and we met. In my group, for some strange reason, my RA who happened to become my lover was in my group but there were no other women. There were about five other men and then we had a male who was a member of the 32 Counseling and Testing Center staff running the group. We met in Escondido--in one of the Escondido apartments--I don't know if they're still called Escondido Apartments. Are they still called that? The tall buildings that are across from the firehouse. Marine-Street: I think they are--Escondido, yes. They're doing a lot of reconstruction up there right now. Gartrell: [00:39:00] I know. Everything's changing. There were apartments that senior students could live in. So two women who were seniors lived there, and they allowed us to use their apartment. It was clear from the very beginning that the conversations were going in the direction of sex and talking about sexual feelings and that was something that seemed to be thrilling to the men to be able to do and felt creepy to me.

Marine-Street: Well that's an encounter group I guess. Gartrell: [00:42:01] Yes, that's an encounter of a sort. Marine-Street: Yes, of a sort. Anything else on that topic? You wrote somewhere that it was ""an environment of daily sexual harassment"" during that time. Gartrell: [00:42:14] Yes. It was. Another illustration of the kind of commentary that was just routine and so irritating when it happened was initially when I got there, I guess miniskirts weren't in fashion yet, but they kind of became in 34 fashion. I wore skirts and shorts. I wore a lot of shorts while it was hot and then I wore skirts some of the time. Actually, they were culotte skirts so that they were kind of like shorts. And my skirts got somewhat shorter as time went on because that was the fashion. I happened to generally make my own clothes because we didn't have the money to buy them. As I came out and became involved in--or had much more awareness of--feminism and got really excited about the beginning of the second wave of feminism, I started changing my clothing style and wearing clothes that were comfortable, not clothes that attracted attention from men. Because my short skirts--well, I mean, I figured all women attracted attention from men--but I felt that the way I dressed attracted attention and it was unwanted attention. I started wearing comfortable clothes that felt so good and so safe. That included overalls and turtlenecks when it was cold. One of my classmates said to me, after I had started wearing these clothes, turned over to me before our class started and said, ""You know I liked you a lot better when you were wearing miniskirts. You really look terrible in overalls."" Marine-Street: This is a male classmate? Gartrell: [00:44:26] A male classmate. Marine-Street: How did you respond? Do you remember? Gartrell: [00:44:29] I just looked kind of horrified and I felt just invaded, and I felt it was an indication of this kind of entitlement to dictate the clothing of a classmate and very aware of the difference in my feeling of safety wearing overalls and a turtleneck versus a short skirt."

The majority were male physician/male therapist-female patient. Going way, way, way, way down in the percentages but the next highest category--thirteen percent of cases--were female-female. I knew of cases. They had come to my attention. They were just as abusive and just as damaging to the patient as any other case of abuse.

Gartrell: [00:04:30] When I was six years old, we lived next door to a physician who had three sons. One of them was a teenager. He and a friend of his lured me and my brother over to their treehouse and said, ""Wouldn't you like to come see our treehouse?"" He said, ""You go up first"" to me and I started climbing, and I said, ""Come on, Greg"" [to my brother]. And he [the neighbor] said, ""No, no, you wait down there."" They wouldn't let him up. They got me up there, and they had a .22 rifle and they pointed the rifle at me and demanded that I engage in sexual activity with them, which I don't think there's a point in describing, but it was phenomenally traumatic. I thought that they were going to kill me, and they threatened to come get me if I told anyone. What happened afterwards was I got down, and I burst into tears and ran to my home. My mother and father were both home at the time. My father examined me physically, which was further embarrassing, and then went over and screamed at the neighbors and told them he was calling the police. Then they consulted--I don't know whom--who said that it would be very traumatic for me to go to court to testify against these boys, and it was better just to leave [it as it was, with] whatever threat my father made against them. We lived in that house for another year and a half. I was terrified every single day. I was terrified every single night. I was afraid they were going to crawl into my window. I actually was terrified throughout the rest of my childhood about the prospect of being raped or assaulted after that incident. Marine-Street: Were there any ramifications for the assaulters? Gartrell: [00:06:35] None whatsoever. When we moved to a new home far across town from where they lived, there was an unfortunate response on my mothers part to a question I asked in a veiled way, hoping that it wouldn't be obvious why I was asking the question. I said to her, ""Do you think there's any chance those neighbors know where we live now?"" She said, ""Oh, of course, I'm sure they know,"" which just took away any feeling of safety that I could have had at this new home. Marine-Street: Did you get any kind of counseling or help? Gartrell: [00:07:13] No. 18 Marine-Street: What did they call what happened to you in those days? Gartrell: [00:07:22] Teenage boys acting badly. Marine-Street: Has your understanding of that changed over time? Gartrell: [00:07:32] It was sexual violence at gunpoint and very, very, very traumatic. Marine-Street: You also mentioned to me that you almost were kidnapped. Was that about that same time? Gartrell: [00:07:48] It was a few years later. We lived next to a lemon orchard. Our house backed up against the lemon orchard. We were not a family of means. We lived in a small track house in Santa Barbara. Our school bus dropped us off about, I would say, a fifteen-minute walk from my home. I had seen a car that followed the school bus frequently, and it was an old man driving an old car. On most days when we were dropped off, there were many of us children. On this particular day, I was the only one. I got off the bus, and I was walking in a fairly leisurely way next to the lemon orchard to my home. This car pulled up next to me, and he rolled down his window, and he said, ""You need to get in. You need to get in."" He looked very frightening to me, and I started running, and he started following me. There was enough room where he could follow me off the road. I started screaming and running, and I ran through the lemon orchard [so] he couldn't take his car through the lemon orchard. I got into my house the back way and went into my room and looked out the window, and I saw that he was cruising by trying to find me. I told my parents. They then called the police and they allegedly looked for this person, but I [often] saw the car [parked] within a mile of our home and no one ever apprehended 19 the person. It was another instance in which, again, there was a complete lack of feeling safe. Marine-Street: What did you do as a child after those instances to kind of make yourself feel safe? Gartrell: [00:09:57] I didn't feel safe. I felt frightened all the time. I felt frightened in my home, outside of my home. I was always afraid of being raped. I was always afraid of being assaulted. Marine-Street: How can you function if you're always afraid? Gartrell: [00:10:12] There are a lot of things that contributed to fear in my life and my parents unfortunately were not psychologically healthy. There was major mental illness in my family so I had that factor contributing to my state of not feeling safe. My father had severe panic disorder, and he was pretty much afraid of the world and afraid of going anywhere. When you have a role model of one parent who is afraid of the world and another parent who was quite mentally ill in a different way, it's not an environment in which a child grows up being given an opportunity to feel safe. On top of that, I then had teachers who hit on me before I left for college. For instance, when I was a tenth grade student, I had a Latin teacher who said to me he wanted to start driving me home. I thought that I needed to comply with that, [but when I] told my father and mother, they said, ""Well, he can come here and meet us, but he's not driving you home."" He touched me in ways that were very creepy. Touched my body and his hands were not where they should be. I mean, here I was doing well academically and having somebody trying to paw me and trying to drive me home."	"wonder if you'd be willing to just talk a little bit about those.

Gartrell: [00:23:53] I guess I would say that my entire career has been one in which the personal is the political.

[My sex abuse work became a parallel track]--also more than a decade's worth of work--because I just happened to fall into some knowledge about [physician] abuse of patients and power abuse.

Gartrell: [00:49:00] Yes, we were told periodically about rapes that happened and women being assaulted outside our dorm. This was starting our first year at Stanford. The lighting was very poor. Our bikes were parked in really dim lighting. I already came to Stanford as a frightened person--worrying about assault and violence. This was not helpful to me at all. We did, as our peer group of women, talk about our fears of going to the library at night. I was petrified of going to the library at night because it involved going out to get my bike where it was dimly lit, where anyone could be grabbed, riding my bike through dark streets to the library, and at both of those places locking the 37 bike. All of these things, if there's nobody else around, made me quite vulnerable and then being in the library, studying until whatever hour, and then making my way back. I was petrified. I mean, from the moment I left the dorm I was petrified. The whole process of thinking about going to the library made me petrified, which meant that I didn't go as often as I wanted to or needed to, which meant that I felt that my [education suffered]. Well, I mean, it was my choice about safety or my fears about safety that prevented me from making adequate uses of the library. At that time, there were no [alarm boxes]. I know now that it seems like every twenty feet, there's an alarm box and I also know that there is [00:50:53] a lot of attention to safety. I'm not talking about the kind of safety that involves drinking alcohol and saying no. I'm talking about just trying to go to the library or trying to go to a night class. I mean, there were things that were happening at night that unless I was going as a member of a group, it didn't feel safe attending. Marine-Street: Did you and any of the other women students do anything to try to feel more safe? Gartrell: [00:51:25] No, we just didn't feel safe and--I mean, it didn't occur to us that we had an opportunity to do anything. Marine-Street: Was there any kind of like self-defense courses or anything? Gartrell: [00:51:37] I don't remember what year it was, but I think it was probably my senior year that a self-defense course was offered, not as an elective but just as a campus activity, and I took it. I found out about it however--going to school at a time when there was no internet, any information you received 38 was word-of-mouth, you happened to have the time to read a flyer in White Plaza, or you happened to have time to read the Stanford Daily, or you had access to the Daily regularly, which I didn't always, especially if I was living off-campus. It was really a matter of luck if you found out about something that you really wanted to do and needed to do. But somehow I found out about it. I attended this class and I loved it. I loved the concept of being taught that I was entitled to pay attention to my fears and that whenever I did feel afraid--whenever something happened that made me feel more afraid--I should pay attention to my feelings because they were a good indicator of my potential risk. My lover who had sex with men before she met me, [and] had sex with men throughout the time she was with me--she was not comfortable being lesbian, didn't want to identify as lesbian, wanted to get married, [and] spent the whole time that I was at Stanford looking for a man to marry at the same time she was involved with me--always said, ""Oh, you're just a wimp, you know, stop being so afraid. What are you so afraid of? You're so afraid of sex with men? Why are you so uptight? You're just incredibly uptight?"" Always the message, ""You are really, really uptight."" To have this validation in this self-defense class that paying attention to [my feeling of fear]--granted, I came from a background of more fear that I carried within me than I wish I ever did--but that if something kicked it up to a higher level, that my feelings were valid and I needed to pay attention to them and I needed to do something about them immediately. Then to learn self-defense techniques to fight or to fight back or to release myself was 39 fabulous. It was such an incredible opportunity to have--to create a sense of empowerment. Marine-Street: Was it a male instructor, do you remember? Gartrell: [00:54:27] Absolutely not. It was all women. Marine-Street: All women? Gartrell: [00:54:29] Yes, I wouldn't have taken a course from a man because how could a man possibly have come from our experience and seen the world in the way we saw the world? Marine-Street: It was another student that was doing it? Do you recall? Gartrell: [00:54:45] Yes, I believe it was another student or somebody from offcampus who came. Marine-Street: Do you remember where they taught the classes? Gartrell: [00:54:52] They were taught in the Roble Gym. Marine-Street: Does anything stick with you about what they taught you like specific techniques? Gartrell: [00:55:03] They were techniques about releasing yourself if someone grabs you and there were techniques about the most vulnerable [ways] to fight back if you were assaulted. I go from that, fast forward to many years later when I got to know Pauline Bart who was a very eloquent writer about rape and women fighting back. She did studies about women who were trained to or learned to fight back versus women who were trained to lie down and take it. I had heard always growing up that if you're assaulted; you're going to be killed if you fight back--until I took this class. 40 When I got to Pauline Bart's readings and then got to know her as a colleague and heard that there were actual data that the women who fought back, very often, got away and were not raped versus those who submitted were a hundred percent raped. There was no guarantee they weren't going to be killed. It was an incredibly eye-opening experience. Marine-Street: I'll say. Let's take a quick break. Gartrell: [00:56:29] Okay. [End of Part 1 of 5 - Interview with Nanette Gartrell - August 29, 2018] 41 42 STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROJECT: STANFORD PIONEERING WOMEN ALUMNAE ORAL HISTORY PROJECT INTERVIEWEE: NANETTE GARTRELL INTERVIEWER: NATALIE MARINE-STREET DATE OF INTERVIEW: AUGUST 29, 2018 PART: 2 OF 5 Marine-Street: Before we move on, is there anything else you'd like to say about the selfdefense course? Gartrell: [00:00:06] One other thing that just came to mind is in Pauline Bart's research about lying down and taking it versus fighting back--and fighting back included using strategies to extract yourself. There were accounts that she provided of women who actually talked men who had weapons out of their weapons and then managed to escape without being assaulted. It's really quite phenomenal but not only did she find that if you do fight back or use a strategy to escape that you have a chance of not being sexually violated. But even if you were raped and you fought back, that the psychological sequelae for those who resisted versus those who didn't was dramatically different. That is fascinating. That was always fascinating to me. The fighters ultimately did better than those who thought that they had to comply and didn't try any strategies. Not that they're to be blamed-those who are to be blamed are the police and the men who told us, ""Don't 43 resist, don't resist."" They are to be blamed, and I have strong feelings about that."	"something that happened then? Gartrell: [00:49:00] Yes, we were told periodically about rapes that happened and women being assaulted outside our dorm. This was starting our first year at Stanford. The lighting was very poor. Our bikes were parked in really dim lighting. I already came to Stanford as a frightened person--worrying about assault and violence. This was not helpful to me at all. We did, as our peer group of women, talk about our fears of going to the library at night. I was petrified of going to the library at night because it involved going out to get my bike where it was dimly lit, where anyone could be grabbed, riding my bike through dark streets to the library, and at both of those places locking the 37 bike. All of these things, if there's nobody else around, made me quite vulnerable and then being in the library, studying until whatever hour, and then making my way back. I was petrified. I mean, from the moment I left the dorm I was petrified. The whole process of thinking about going to the library made me petrified, which meant that I didn't go as often as I wanted to or needed to, which meant that I felt that my [education suffered]. Well, I mean, it was my choice about safety or my fears about safety that prevented me from making adequate uses of the library. At that time, there were no [alarm boxes]. I know now that it seems like every twenty feet, there's an alarm box and I also know that there is [00:50:53] a lot of attention to safety. I'm not talking about the kind of safety that involves drinking alcohol and saying no. I'm talking about just trying to go to the library or trying to go to a night class. I mean, there were things that were happening at night that unless I was going as a member of a group, it didn't feel safe attending. Marine-Street: Did you and any of the other women students do anything to try to feel more safe? Gartrell: [00:51:25] No, we just didn't feel safe and--I mean, it didn't occur to us that we had an opportunity to do anything. Marine-Street: Was there any kind of like self-defense courses or anything? Gartrell: [00:51:37] I don't remember what year it was, but I think it was probably my senior year that a self-defense course was offered, not as an elective but just as a campus activity, and I took it.

The summer before we entered Stanford, to my knowledge, every one of us received a letter offering the opportunity to participate in an encounter group when we arrived. It was described as an opportunity to have a member of the Counseling and Testing Center meet with a small group of us to talk about our experiences and to get to know one another well and share things that we might not feel comfortable sharing just in general. But, you know, in a safe environment. I read it. My parents read it. At first I thought, ""Why not, it sounds good."" My parents read it and thought, ""Oh, wow, free therapy. Great. So do it."" I signed up to do it and we met. In my group, for some strange reason, my RA who happened to become my lover was in my group but there were no other women. There were about five other men and then we had a male who was a member of the 32 Counseling and Testing Center staff running the group. We met in Escondido--in one of the Escondido apartments--I don't know if they're still called Escondido Apartments. Are they still called that? The tall buildings that are across from the firehouse. Marine-Street: I think they are--Escondido, yes. They're doing a lot of reconstruction up there right now. Gartrell: [00:39:00] I know. Everything's changing. There were apartments that senior students could live in. So two women who were seniors lived there, and they allowed us to use their apartment. It was clear from the very beginning that the conversations were going in the direction of sex and talking about sexual feelings and that was something that seemed to be thrilling to the men to be able to do and felt creepy to me. Early into these meetings, we were told to pair off and there were all those kinds of touchy-feely things that were done back then in group dynamics where you close your eyes and, you know, see what you can communicate to another person through holding their hands like this and things like that. That kind of pairing off, we were given some instructions about that. I found out later that the woman who became my lover, my RA, and the man she was paired off with--what he did was he reached around, undid her bra, and was feeling her breasts during that encounter. That made me feel incredibly freaked out. She didn't complain. She just went along with it. She was sexually involved with men before she became involved with me. I guess, I don't know, some number of sessions later, we arrived and the group leader was on the couch holding the hands and stroking one of the women 33 who lived in the apartment. He said, ""Well, let's resume later."" She went into the bedroom, and we started our meeting and he stopped it after, I don't know, five or ten minutes. And he said, ""You know, I have some unfinished business to do with what's-her-name and so why don't you carry on without me."" We kind of, I don't know, carried on somehow without him. I had to go to the bathroom, and I got up to go to the bathroom, and the door to the room was open and they were having sex. And I, from other women classmates, heard similar stories of power and sex abuse by these people who supposedly represented mental health professionals affiliated with Stanford, which was just appalling. Marine-Street: Was he a student? Gartrell: [00:41:43] No, he was a member of the Counseling and Testing Center staff in the Dean of Students Office at the Old Union. Marine-Street: The girl that he was having sex with was an older student? Gartrell: [00:41:55] Student, yes. She was a senior. Marine-Street: But an undergraduate? Gartrell: [00:41:57] Yes.

Well, what can I tell you about Wonder Girls? As far as I can tell, there are no other books that document the work of groups of activist girls. There are books about individual activists like Malala. But I was seeing, as early as 2007, girls in Zimbabwe who began a girls movement in their country.

I was thinking about this book for a while, both in relationship to Women Who Light the Dark and Grandmother Power. It was a natural next step to explore the topic of groups of activist girls, partly because I think these intractable problems will take a long time to solve. [00:48:16] I was interested in groups because once there is [an organizational] structure, the current participants can go on to the rest of their 98 lives--and younger girls can grow into that structure and continue the work. So I wanted to focus on groups from the beginning. [For Wonder Girls], I went to thirteen countries, one of which was the US, and interviewed fifteen groups of activist girls working on all kinds of initiatives from the environment to social justice to exploitation to child marriage and so forth

And the way he showed it was, and this was before the days when sexual harassment was a word, and he used to do it by telling the girls very, very dirty jokes. And of course, we were, like I said, both the girls in medical school, we had become desks and books, you know, we had no life experience much at all. And so all we could do was blush and had absolutely no idea what, if anything, we could or should do. We were speechless.

And of course, we were, like I said, both the girls in medical school, we had become desks and books, you know, we had no life experience much at all. And so all we could do was blush and had absolutely no idea what, if anything, we could or should do. We were speechless.

She said, ""Yes we did, and they took them down."" [laughter] So there probably was an environment of what today we'd call harassment or not a very nice way to act, but I don't remember it bothering me."	"So I never have considered gender to be a handicap. In fact, I think that I got many, many, many opportunities. Many doors opened to me because the pool of women was small. It was easier for me because I wasn't a wife, I wasn't a mother, I didn't have to multitask. All of the things that make it very, very, very difficult for the youth today, I get it because I spend time mentoring them. I understand the problem of multitasking and trying to be all things for all people. [00:25:29] It was easier for me because I didn't have to do all those things. In a way, I could be very selfish. I didn't have to take care of anybody else but myself and then do what I wanted to do. What I wanted to do was succeed at Stanford. I didn't want to disappoint Henry Kaplan or Malcolm Bagshaw or Rich Hoppe or Dean Pizzo or whoever happened to be the person in leadership. So I never really saw gender as an issue. My friend Karen Fu, who was a trainee at the same time I was, reminded me of the day we came to Stanford. The room where the residents sat had lots of posters of Playboy pinups, posters of these braless calendar girls all over the walls. [00:26:26] I didn't remember, but Karen told me we walked into the residents' room said, ""Take those down or we're going to put male nudes up on the wall."" I said, ""Karen, did we say that?""

[laughter] So there probably was an environment of what today we'd call harassment or not a very nice way to act, but I don't remember it bothering me. [00:27:01] But my colleagues at Dartmouth, my friends, the girls in my class, talked about it all the time and still do, and they're asked to speak about it and write book chapters on it and speak to women's groups, etcetera. And they do. And I do, but I don't remember it being negative. Maybe I just don't put those things on my main menu. Maybe I just don't let them bother me. If they bothered me, I didn't put them in long-term memory. Gender has always been a card that's worked very, very well for me. I'm sure I've had opportunities I wouldn't have had otherwise because the pool of available women was very small."

But we also came in 1968. We had never really been in positions of responsibility in the way that we were in our previous experience. We were 31 now responsible in a world in which there were really drugs as well as alcohol, but maybe drugs [were] a more serious problem, including LSD. It was the big time of LSD and lots of experimenting in drugs. And it was also part of the period of sexual experimentation for young people, but both of us were very Victorian Catholic people. I keep saying this and telling you this. We had no personal background that would make it easy for us to even figure out how to operate. We did have assistant R.A.'s, who we needed and were very helpful, but they, too, were graduate students and were really not into the undergraduate scene. We communicated with them well, and they would mostly say to us, ""Leave it to us. It's better that we try to deal with this LSD overdose that's happening in the dorm. You have to know about it, but it won't help for you to come in. Let us talk to them."" [00:52:09] So we were constantly aware through our R.A.'s, but we were also horrified and distressed, but I don't think that we knew exactly what to do.

The reason for this goes back to the time when I was working with David Hamburg at the outdoor primate facility. There were several research assistants there who were, they reported, molested by one of the psychiatry department members--not David, obviously. I won't mention this person's name, (he's long gone by now). Anyway, it was a legitimate complaint. What 49 they were reporting was real molestation. This was not simply harassment or ""he says, she says"" kinds of things -- unless they were lying, which it turned out they weren't. Because there were so few women faculty members, the reported incidents landed on my desk. [01:03:18] I was assistant professor at the time, which meant that this shouldn't have landed on my desk at all. I went to the chairman of the department once I ascertained that this was really a true report. These three girls were extremely upset and all they wanted to have happen was for the molestation to stop. They didn't want the psychiatry department member punished, they didn't want anything else. They wanted the molestation to stop. I reported to the chairman of the department, Tom Gonda, who fundamentally said, ""Boys will be boys."" [01:03:53] Those are actually his words. I then took the matter to Herant Katchadourian, then the ombudsman of the university. He took it to the dean, Miller at the time. I thought they handled it wonderfully well. They asked this faculty member to write an undated letter of resignation and sign it and told him that if this ever happened again, even one more incident of this type, they would simply accept his resignation at that point in time. Things cooled off for the next few years. [01:04:31] The problem was that when an incident of this sort happened again, some fifteen or twenty years later, there was no record of the earlier incident. The woman involved decided to sue Stanford. Tobey: Was this the same man? 50 Kraemer: [01:04:46] Same man. She was his research assistant. She decided to sue, and her lawyer made it clear that unless there had been some knowledge by the university that this was going on, Stanford could not be sued. She could sue him, but she couldn't sue Stanford. The question then was: Had Stanford any knowledge of any untoward activities by this man? By this time, there was a different president of the university, a different provost, a different dean, a different chairman. Everything was different. [01:05:20] Nobody officially remembered the previous incidents at all. The lawyer went to Frances Conley and said. ""Do you know of anything?"" Frances said, ""If anybody knows, it's going to be Helen."" I had all the documentation and gave it to the lawyer. I thought that was only fair. But the letter of resignation was gone, so the wonderful solution all those years before had just disappeared. The suit was finally settled.

And, some years later, I established and directed the House Staff Well-Being Committee, and again, being a woman was advantageous. And I mentored a lot of women residents and faculty because I think there is more of an affinity for a woman in those roles.

But those were important things, more important from the point of view of things that I did than harassment. Now, my very last days at Stanford involved me in a sexual harassment policy issue, or sexual harassment charge, which Fran Conley mentions in her book. It was alleged by somebody in radiology which was known as a place where there were issues. Tracy: An aggressive atmosphere? Mahoney: [sentences deleted] There was some complaint made to the dean of medicine, say, in the middle of the week. That same complaint in all its detail appeared in the San Jose Mercury in the Sunday edition on Saturday, arguing, complaining about the harassment of women in radiology. This man [the department chair who was the focus of the allegation] was asked about it the next Friday night when he went to temple, and his kid was asked about it at school. It was terrible. So the dean put together a committee. The committee did an investigation. I was part of the committee. Alberta was part of the committee. There was a group of us. We had a court reporter in the room at all times. We interviewed every tech in the hospital that worked with the department. We worked with everybody in the department. We had something like sixty-three interviews. 99 I came away from that process absolutely convinced that everybody in the department was harassed and that it was an equal opportunity harassment. It wasn't sexual. Women felt harassed especially when you combined their professional work with their family work, but men felt harassed. PhD men in the department felt harassed. It was a place of harassment. But we found no reason to think that this poor new chair of the department was the harasser. We did find reason to believe that there was somebody who didn't like his coming who might have been the source of this, but we didn't get into that, as our charge was merely to find what the story was. So that was my most exciting harassment story. I mean, sixty-three people and a court reporter whose salary just from us must have been in the six figures. They talked with medical terminology that I certainly didn't understand. She would stop them and ask them if they meant this or that. She had a bachelor's and a master's degree in some medical sciences field. But it was taken very seriously. So, no, I think sexual harassment claims have been seriously taken at Stanford.

Martin: [01:48:33] We had the female faculty caucus. As a result of first presenting the pay data, a lot of women called me to help them think through what they should do. I met a lot of women all over campus through that. Then I co-led the faculty caucus, and that brought other issues to the fore other than pay. Cecilia and I in particular took on Condi Rice (provost) on a number of those issues. We played the role of loyal to Stanford, but still in opposition on some issues. Then in the faculty senate, I was out there doing a lot of different things, not all to do with women. I got known. Then that got me elected. [01:49:32] I started getting elected to things like the Faculty Advisory Board. It just progressed. It wasn't solely, but it was heavily driven by getting to know women all over campus on the faculty. That was nice because I didn't know too many here in the Business School. We were so busy. [laughter] 64 There wasn't a lot of just social stuff. We did get together over dinner two or three times a year and it was mainly the Clayman Institute group. We'd get together for dinner and drinks and talk and stuff. We had a lot of one-on-one meetings. On an average week, I'd probably have lunch with other women two times, three times. [01:50:32] Sometimes a woman I didn't know needed advice on something, sometimes a woman who had been raped or harassed sexually, a faculty woman, and sometimes just a friend or a friend of a friend.

Did you see a change in that over the years?	"Martin: [01:51:25] When I was the only woman faculty in the GSB--. If you were raped in the Business School -- student, faculty - -who would you come to on the faculty? So I did a lot of that kind of counseling then. The university ombudsman put complaints about certain faculty ""in the drawer."" There were complaints about some people over the years that were never acted on. The actual policy arguments were something I spoke up about in the faculty senate, but I wasn't a primary person on that. Tracy: Considering your position and being one of the only women, what was your sense of how prevalent sexual assault and sexual harassment were? Did you see a change in that over the years? 65 Martin: [01:52:34] When I came I was really visible because I was the only one in the Business School. People came to me from all over campus, freshmen even, in tears, ""I was a virgin. I got raped."" Over time, the university began to respond on the undergraduate level by having a widespread network of people who did that kind of counseling. I was very glad to get out of that business. At the doctoral and postdoctoral and the faculty level, the retaliation and repercussions of complaining are really career-sensitive, particularly if you came to Stanford to work with one person in a very narrow field, and that person's going to be writing your recommendations until the day he dies. Saying no to some of those people, they immediately would withdraw support from you. An offer to talk on a panel at a conference or contribute a chapter to a book suddenly disappears. It's a hint that you better find someone else to write your letter of recommendation. Whether you're going to actually take that complaint up through the university hierarchy when that person's been doing this for years and has always gotten away with it, that's a very tough decision for a victim, and I found it awkward. I don't want to talk about this much more because every time someone comes to you, you're supposed to report it to the administration. Some
of those cases, they would never have talked to me if they thought I would report it. They really needed to talk to somebody. I didn't have pat answers because those people are damned if they do and damned if they don't. We could talk more about what if this, and what if that, but like any good counselor, I wouldn't tell someone what to do in a situation like that. I've been actively involved in that. By the time the policy 66 came through I spoke up, and I spoke up in the senate, and I think it had an effect on some issues. Over time, the most important aspects of that policy did get revised, sometimes better, sometimes worse. I was just one of many at that point."

Whatever my loving family did, they instilled in me a confidence that I rarely see in the young women I train now. 44 I have never been without confidence. I've never doubted what I could do. If you have that confidence, whatever is going on around you is their problem, not yours. I know that sounds odd, but it made a huge difference, having faith in myself. I didn't need someone else to tell me what I could do--I knew. Did I face discrimination because I was a woman? Of course I did. We all did. But to me it was their problem, not mine. I had a job to do, and it just never stopped me. [01:08:17] There were difficult experiences. Of course there were. I remember once giving a talk. I was quite young. It was just after I graduated. I gave a talk at a Gordon Research Conference. Gordon Conferences are meetings held up in New Hampshire and Vermont on specific areas of science. They go on for a week, and you meet in the morning and you meet at night. It's scientists, all the hotshot scientists in your area. So it was a big honor that I was giving a twenty-minute talk at this thing, and I remember it was at night. It was in the days of miniskirts. This is late 1960s, early 1970s. It was rare to have women around, and there I was. I got up on the stage to start my talk, and my mic didn't work. I said, ""Should I take it off?"" [01:09:12] And some guy--I'll never forget this--in the audience said, ""Take it off. Take it all off."" And there I am, standing there alone on this stage, at night, in a dark room, with the light on me, and all these men. I burst into tears. I had never done that before. The tears were just streaming down my face. Suddenly it got quiet in the room, and these guys had realized that they had crossed some terrible barrier. 45 I sniffed and wiped my tears away, and I said, ""Are you done, and are you ready to hear some science?"" I took a deep breath, and I gave my goddamn talk.

I didn't need someone else to tell me what I could do--I knew. Did I face discrimination because I was a woman? Of course I did. We all did. But to me it was their problem, not mine. I had a job to do, and it just never stopped me. [01:08:17] There were difficult experiences. Of course there were. I remember once giving a talk. I was quite young. It was just after I graduated. I gave a talk at a Gordon Research Conference. Gordon Conferences are meetings held up in New Hampshire and Vermont on specific areas of science. They go on for a week, and you meet in the morning and you meet at night. It's scientists, all the hotshot scientists in your area. So it was a big honor that I was giving a twenty-minute talk at this thing, and I remember it was at night. It was in the days of miniskirts. This is late 1960s, early 1970s. It was rare to have women around, and there I was. I got up on the stage to start my talk, and my mic didn't work. I said, ""Should I take it off?"" [01:09:12] And some guy--I'll never forget this--in the audience said, ""Take it off. Take it all off."" And there I am, standing there alone on this stage, at night, in a dark room, with the light on me, and all these men. I burst into tears. I had never done that before. The tears were just streaming down my face. Suddenly it got quiet in the room, and these guys had realized that they had crossed some terrible barrier. 45 I sniffed and wiped my tears away, and I said, ""Are you done, and are you ready to hear some science?"" I took a deep breath, and I gave my goddamn talk. And that was the worst experience I had ever experienced. I figured if I could get through that, hey."

And there were problems with sexual harassment, particularly in the Medical School. We recommended that Stanford pay attention to this culture of nonsupport and try to create a new culture of support, and that the university look pretty carefully at the salary system to figure out what to do about these grave disparities in salaries between women and men.	Strober: [00:09:02] We were able to get statistical data on other peer universities. We looked at universities in the Ivy League, and also at universities in the Pac-10 that we played football against, and we added MIT and Caltech to the mix. That was the group that we compared ourselves to. We were able to get those data in terms of percentage of women in the various ranks. But to try to get a handle on what women were thinking and feeling, we did interviews of Stanford faculty, and each of the committee members participated in conducting interviews with focus groups. We decided to concentrate on junior women, and we decided to interview men as well as women, because we wanted to know which problems were problems for all junior faculty and which were women's problems in particular. So we were able to sort that out pretty well. One of our major findings was that there was not a culture of support at Stanford, that departments went to great trouble to bring the best and the brightest junior faculty to Stanford and then proceeded to ignore them. There were faculty who told us they couldn't even get senior people in their department to read their work, and they didn't feel supported. This was men and women. Then a lot of women told us they felt underpaid. And there were problems with sexual harassment, particularly in the Medical School. We recommended that Stanford pay attention to this culture of nonsupport and try to create a new culture of support, and that the university look pretty carefully at the salary system to figure out what to do about these grave disparities in salaries between women and men.
1407	Strober, Myra	SHSF	1940	1940	NY	White	Graduate or professional degree	Married (except if separated)	2	2014.0	74	"university actually tried to make those changes? Strober: [00:15:40] I think that the biggest change that was made was by Gerhard Casper, who was, after all, a law professor and very concerned about sexual harassment and the university's obligations and liabilities. So he created a sexual harassment reporting system that I think was very good and continues to be very good. Particularly he created a group of people--and I was one of them--who were called sexual harassment advisors. I always used to joke that 49 if anybody wanted to sexually harass somebody, they had to come to me first for my advice. [laughter] But we were called advisors, and the good thing was that our names were publicized, and anybody from any place in the university could come and talk to any of the advisors. So if you were a woman in Chemistry and you didn't want to talk to an advisor in the sciences because you wanted more anonymity than that, you could come and talk to me, and many women from the sciences did come and talk to me. Gerhard was very concerned about due process for the person who was being accused, and he was also concerned about the rights of the person who was doing the accusing, and I think he set up a system that was fair. It's not perfect. Many women suffer sexual harassment and don't report it because they fear for their future, particularly graduate students, where it might get around in their discipline that they have complained in this way, and they're fearful that they won't get an assistant professor position. So it isn't perfect. But the other thing Casper did was to hire Laraine Zappert to run this program, and she is a therapist and very sensitive to all these issues of rights and responsibilities. She trained all the advisors, and she often worked behind the scenes, so if someone, for instance, would come to me with a complaint, I would go to her. Let me backtrack a minute. As an advisor, I had to be very careful to tell the person who was coming to talk to me that if she told me the name of the person who was being accused, that it was my responsibility to report that to Laraine. But the woman didn't have to tell me the name of the 50 person. She could come to me and tell her story and get advice without telling me the name, in which case I would tell Laraine that a complaint had been made. But I wouldn't tell her by whom, and I wouldn't tell her, obviously, who was being accused because I didn't know myself. But if the woman complaining told me who she was accusing, even if she didn't want to file a complaint, Laraine might talk to her and kind of work behind the scenes. So, for example, one time there was a complaint, and Laraine suggested tha
 I go to the faculty member who was being accused, with that faculty member's department chair, and just sort of tell that person that there had been somebody who had talked to me and maybe this faculty member wanted to be a little more circumspect in the future. And you would be surprised, this works well. Faculty members, when they are confronted by their peers who tell them, ""This is not acceptable behavior at this university,"" may well reform.

1420												Yes, this is a triptych about addiction. This first one is really about everything that goes with it as far as living in an alcoholic family, the consequences of it, and some of the things that because children end up raising other children. You could even say, maybe teen pregnancy, but a lot of it has to do with how we treat each other even when you re in that. The consequences of it, like I said. The acting out, and the high risk, and the rage. Then, of course, broken promises, good intentions, but broken promises. This COA stands for Children of Alcoholics, and on the can it says DUI. It s a multigenerational thing. That s why planting seeds is on there because if people grow up in this environment they re more likely to, unfortunately, become the same way. They hear all this stuff growing up, I hate you. You can t do anything right. You re stupid. You re not good enough. Those are just, don t cry, standard things, so it s a lot of feelings in there. (Laughs) Little Thunder Okay. This is the second part of the triptych. 29 Henderson This is the second part of the triptych. You can see that they go together as far as flowing into, one to another. Like I was saying a while ago, as a result of all of this, a lot of times this is what you get from it. This represents the internalizing all of these things and the consequences of that. All of these things that are written into the figure is what s internalized and what people think about themselves if they grew up in this environment. A lot of times children of alcoholics, they have shame, they feel like they re no good. Even if they ve been told, You re a great person, or whatever and, You re doing wonderful things, nothing s ever good enough. They re very angry. Some of this other stuff is what people say, I m worried about you. They re just kind of standard things that come with it. Resentment. Why did this happen to me? Sometimes there will be sexual assault. They ll grow up with all sorts of emotional issues from that kind of trauma. The black part is very important because people that are in that depression, that s what they say, all of them say it, All I could see was black. That s all I can see. This part right here represents, the little white and yellow, is kind of like a light at the end of the tunnel. They ll describe that, too. They ll say, I can see a little bit of a light, but they don t really want to believe it, and they can t believe it because it has to do with the fear, and the anger, and not thinking they can 30 do anything about it. So a lot of them do suicide. They disintegrate, they develop depression, and they isolate, so that s why we ve got this person sitting up here, isolated. Little Thunder I can see why students would relate so strongly to this, too. All right, and this is the last one of the triptych. Henderson Yes, so you can see how it also flows into the other one, the last one. What the last one represents is recovery basically surviving. If a person makes it through all of this, and they live and they don t commit suicide and they actually get some help, and work through those things this is what can happen. These are some of the promises and some of the support and things that happen. That you re not alone because you really feel like you are. What you realize when you get that support is that you re not alone. They teach you how to be grateful, that s part of the changing in the thinking. Because you know you can think of the glass half empty, or half full. So they teach you about and part of that is about gratitude. The easiest way to get to a positive thought is through gratitude and you got to think about it because sometimes we like to dwell in our feeling sorry for ourselves. That s also where the healing starts, and being able to celebrate, and feeling blessed where the miracles start to happen. The hand goes through from the person and it s holding like a little lamp, so that s like the symbol of hope, and the butterfly for renewal.	Yes, this is a triptych about addiction.

Even if they ve been told, You re a great person, or whatever and, You re doing wonderful things, nothing s ever good enough. They re very angry. Some of this other stuff is what people say, I m worried about you. They re just kind of standard things that come with it. Resentment. Why did this happen to me? Sometimes there will be sexual assault. They ll grow up with all sorts of emotional issues from that kind of trauma. The black part is very important because people that are in that depression, that s what they say, all of them say it, All I could see was black. That s all I can see. This part right here represents, the little white and yellow, is kind of like a light at the end of the tunnel. They ll describe that, too. They ll say, I can see a little bit of a light, but they don t really want to believe it, and they can t believe it because it has to do with the fear, and the anger, and not thinking they can 30 do anything about it. So a lot of them do suicide. They disintegrate, they develop depression, and they isolate, so that s why we ve got this person sitting up here, isolated. Little Thunder I can see why students would relate so strongly to this, too. All right, and this is the last one of the triptych. Henderson Yes, so you can see how it also flows into the other one, the last one. What the last one represents is recovery basically surviving. If a person makes it through all of this, and they live and they don t commit suicide and they actually get some help, and work through those things this is what can happen. These are some of the promises and some of the support and things that happen. That you re not alone because you really feel like you are. What you realize when you get that support is that you re not alone. They teach you how to be grateful, that s part of the changing in the thinking. Because you know you can think of the glass half empty, or half full. So they teach you about and part of that is about gratitude. The easiest way to get to a positive thought is through gratitude and you got to think about it because sometimes we like to dwell in our feeling sorry for ourselves. That s also where the healing starts, and being able to celebrate, and feeling blessed where the miracles start to happen. The hand goes through from the person and it s holding like a little lamp, so that s like the symbol of hope, and the butterfly for renewal.

She said, “Okla, you need to get out of this house and enjoy yourself.” So there for a year I wouldn’t go nowhere but to work and to church and Sunday school with my kids, you know. So we went to this club, drove up, backed my car in. I remember I had a green and white Cutlass Supreme Oldsmobile, and backed in. Just so happened the owner of the club was standing in the door. When he, my husband, almost husband, almost to be a divorced husband, he pulled up in front of my car and blocked me in and came around to my side. I had the windows rolled up, just cracked a little bit. The first thing that popped in my mind was that he had a gun. So the owner of the club was standing in the door and ordered him to get off of his property. So he still was trying to figure out some way to get to me through my rolled up window. So the owner of the club told him, says, “I’m going to tell you one more time or else I’m going to leave you laying right where you standing,” because most of those club owners and stuff carries a gun for protection and safety. So he got in his car and left. I told Dorothy, I said, “Well we’re not going in the club because he’ll probably come back.” She said, “I don’t know the owner.” I said, “I know him. He’s not going to let him in this club after he done ordered him off his property.” 

The club was on Virgin. We went way out north part of town to a friend of my friend and her friend to use the telephone. So we got out and I went in and asked if I could use a phone, so I called the police. I figured he had gone back over to the house, which when the police came he asked me where I was. I said, “I’m out here with a friend of mine off of Thirty-sixth Street North.” He said, “How long will it take you to get to your home?” I said, “Oh, about five minutes.” So when me and my friend drove up there, there was three police cars with two policemen. He done run off in the ditch on the side of our house. So the police ordered him to get that car out of that ditch and leave and he said he didn’t want to get another call from me that he’s back over there harassing me or bothering me anywhere I was. I didn’t be bothered with him for a long time, but he would come while I was at work to see the kids, which is fine. I said, “He just better not harm any of them.” So that’s the end of that."

And these were southern gentlemen protecting southern womanhood. These poor little girls were prostitutes, you know, and they hadn't had any chance. They were textile workers. They lived in the Negro section of town. They had the most miserable kind of lives. They were harmless, as I was in a different kind of way. It wasn't their fault that they had to try to make money. And they were caught on this train, you know, with these Negro boys and they all came from the same class. They didn't have any particular antagonism except when the law enforcement officers got into it. That's all you need to have lynched all of them right on the spot was to say two white girls were riding on a train with nine Negroes. Negroes. Why of course they were raped. That just stood to be. . . there was no question about it. It was just a matter of fact. That's what those niggers did. That's all they were interested in in life. Natural thing they started out with. Well, here I come down in my innocent way and asking them all these questions about the legality of this and so on.	"But when I was on my own after I got up to Scottsboro, then I knew what I was doing. Inquiring, going around asking the people who should know. I interviewed the judge and the sheriff and the page 12 mayor of the town. So finally they all got together and in this meeting there was the judge of the trial, the doctor who examined the girlyou know what the case was about. So they invited me into this room to, presumably, to answer any questions that I had. And they shut the door and two policemen stood on each side of the door and the policemen came and guarded the room all around. I sat in the chair. . . M.F.: You were alone? Ransdall: Yes, I was alone. I wasn't afraid. I'm not afraid of things like that. It never occured to me. I was just startled. I was surprised. After all, I knew they weren't going to shoot me on the spot. They couldn't get away with that! But it never occurred to me to be afraid. I was very sincere about this. I took this awfully seriously. One of these boys was thirteen years old and this seemed to me a terrible thing and there must be some reason. And these were southern gentlemen. They said ""We're very surprised. We'd like to know what organization sent you down here. No respectable organization would send a white woman down to ask about a lot of niggers."" That was their attitude, you see. That I wasn't respectable. There was something wrong. I must be straight from Moscow or something like that. And they were puzzled because I didn't look like somebody from Moscow. I didn't act like I had a bomb in my pocket. I looked like a perfectly scaredno, I wasn't scared. I looked like a harmless little school teacher. They used to think I was a school teacher. So this inconsistency and this treating me as though I was a dangerous criminal and at the same time. . . this conflict. This was a very interesting wanted to write a book about it.

JACQUELYN HALL: And that came up in the meetings? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Yes, that was understood. That's one of the things, if you look back into the establishment of the old interracial movement here in Atlanta and some white women in other places &#8230; you see, white men always said that they were protecting white womanhood and they wanted to keep them pure. And they cloistered their women. Even in slavery, they would cloister their women, but they would go out and have babies by the slaves. And then, often these men in these prominent white families had their black paramours that their families knew about, because they didn't want to violate these young white women that were in those families. And even during slavery, some of the most beautiful black slaves, mulattos, were sold into the slave markets of New Orleans where they were bought to be mistresses of a number of sons of these masters. And of the masters themselves. And Thomas Jefferson had two or three daughters sold down there as slaves. JACQUELYN HALL: In the meetings of the Interracial Commission, did the white women talk about this situation? MODJESKA SIMKINS: No, it was known. They didn't talk about that. I don't remember that coming up, but I do know that when you look back into the history of it, that's what started it. They became incensed because the men were always talking about them just like they were helpless, you know, snivelings. And they knew that a lot of times, they were lying. And then, some of them felt that it was a reflection on their intelligence. And then, a number of them knew that their men were lying. Many times, when they did this and were going on like that, they realized that &#8230; although I never heard this said in a meeting, I've had it expressed to me otherwise, that a lot of this thing that men were talking about protecting them from black men was because they knew how they were violating black women and they just thought that the shoe would turn the other way. JACQUELYN HALL: Did you have that expressed to you in private conversations? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Just talking like we are now, or maybe two or three people together. And very often, as in the case that I told you about my grandfather, it was known by the whites around there that he was going with these black women. And at the same time, they wanted to kill a black man that went with a white woman. And although prior to, I think it was 1895, when Ben Tillman started &#8230; with Ben Tillman's regime in South Carolina, there was no Jim Crow on the trains. Blacks and whites went to dances together. I've had an old white woman tell me that she had been to dances many nights where Negroes were with whites. They would visit each other's homes out on the plantation like that during Reconstruction and after Reconstruction. And then, they brought in these Black Codes. They took back the government and then they put in all these laws and that created this particular thing that we have had to fight all these hundred years.

I could just say that I don't think the South would be the same without what they did, because they opened the eyes of a number of people. The thing that the political power structure had against the organizations of that kind was the fear that they would bring the black and white mass together. And the power structure has always feared the combining of the forces of black and white masses. I can remember the first meeting of the Southern Negro Youth Congress I went to in Knoxville where there were miners, people in brogan shoes, overalls, just like they wear jeans around here now. The average person didn't think of wearing them then unless they were going to the field or going to the mines. And those fellows came out there with brogans, and overalls, and sunhats, and all of them were working and planning together. Well, the first thing they did when they got a chance was to red smear and disrupt the movement. Now, I think if the Southern Negro Youth Congress, for instance, could have gone on, there would have been a very great change in the South because the younger people would have worked together better. But the power structure doesn't want that. They don't want poor whites and Negroes getting along together. There's always been the effort, either obvious or subtle, on the part of the reigning element to keep the forces of blacks and whites apart. But they built it on the sex angle. They always say, ""They'll rape your women. They want to marry your daughter."" But they weren't thinking about that. They didn't care any more about a poor white than they did about a Negro. And they still don't. They just give them a little more deference because he's white like they are, but they don't give a damn about a poor white. They'll exploit him just like they will a Negro. I've seen it. I know what I'm talking about. So that was their affair. Why do they have to worry about Negro men and their women? If they hadn't power enough to hold their women, if somebody could take their women from 'em,, why, they ought to take 'em. You see? Just like I hear people say sometimes if a woman can't hold her husband why would she want to get mad with somebody else for taking him? She ought to be able to hold him, treat him right, give him good food, take care of him. You never find, for instance, as I heard an old preacher say once, you'll never find a dog leaving home and going to stay at somebody else's house if you're treating that dog all right at your house. He's not going anywhere else. Well, when you find the dog trotting over there every time you turn around, somebody's throwing him a bone over there. He never gets a bone over here, just gets some dry bread and maybe a kick in the fanny, you know? [laughter] So, they use that sex thing. And they have used it as a social equality angle. They wanted to keep those forces apart, and they wanted to see that Negroes wouldn't take your job. When the unions come in, they try to tell whites if you get a union, the Negroes will take your jobs. They'll be making much as you make, or they'll bring your salary down to theirs, and all that kind of stuff. It's to divide the forces."	"MODJESKA SIMKINS: I can't fully assess it.

You never find, for instance, as I heard an old preacher say once, you'll never find a dog leaving home and going to stay at somebody else's house if you're treating that dog all right at your house. He's not going anywhere else. Well, when you find the dog trotting over there every time you turn around, somebody's throwing him a bone over there. He never gets a bone over here, just gets some dry bread and maybe a kick in the fanny, you know? [laughter] So, they use that sex thing. And they have used it as a social equality angle. They wanted to keep those forces apart, and they wanted to see that Negroes wouldn't take your job. When the unions come in, they try to tell whites if you get a union, the Negroes will take your jobs. They'll be making much as you make, or they'll bring your salary down to theirs, and all that kind of stuff. It's to divide the forces."

And they called him out and said a little girl, that was maybe going home from school that afternoon, went on a trail through the woods. And when she got home she told her father that a black man, or surely a black ""boy"", you know, a black ""boy"" had followed her on the trail. That is, he had walked behind her, some distance behind her. He might not have been following her. After all, he didn't molest her, didn't touch her, and didn't say anything to her. Well, the father got all upset. That's what happened. I found that out later. But this was the tale that was going the night before. So what happened was that the father alerted all the men in the community, so they got a big posse out in the woods, and they finally found the so-called follower, the ""boy"", who had followed this little girl. And they just took him out the next morning, out on the hillside by the woods, hanged him to a limb and shot him to death. I mean, it was just as simple as that.

So, in one way, we broke the ice. It was something unheard of, you see, that we would bring our Negro friends to our home!	"THELMA STEVENS: In that same old house, yes. And we stayed there a year, until we had . . . became acquainted a little bit with the community and knew more about the population spread and where the needs were greatest. So then we thought they ought to buy a certain piece of property in a different location, nearer the heart of the community. And so they did, and built the buildings, one big two story building and a big gymnasium. And we had a small playground, and a little worker's cottage where the white workers lived. And the Negro workers lived in the upstairs of the big building. My white co-worker, Dorothy Weber (from Lake Charles, Louisiana) and I were told that we could not live in the big building. Negroes and whites living together in those days would not be wise in the minds of people in the city and would destroy our chance to develop a community center. We moved into the little four-room cottage at the corner of the playground, but had our meals with our co-workers in the big building. We faced acres of cotton warehouses! Police patrolled the street in front of the cottage and banged on our door at all hours of the night ""to use the phone."" We were far more frightened of the police than we were of the drunks who wandered around at night on the playground. In 1930 - 31 ""bootleg liquor"" was flowing freely "" the kind that drove people crazy. We were both very young and the strain of constant anxiety was too great. Finally, when a drunk tried to get in our bedroom window, we knew we had to move. The Negro community advised Dorothy and me to move for the community's safety as well as our own. If we had been molested in any way, mob violence against Negroes would have broken loose. So we moved into an apartment upstairs in the residence of Mrs. Verdery, one of our Bethleham Center Board members. We had our Negro friends and some of the activity groupd come to our apartment as often as busy schedules permitted. We would (Portions of pages 46 and 47 have been omitted by Thelma Stevens.

And part of my job there was going to be training student leaders around how to handle hearings, disciplinary hearings and those kinds of things. Part of it was sexual assault issues and helping to do compassionate appropriate response to students who were survivors of sexual violence and also helping to draft and administer policies around sexual violence. So there had been a lot of controversy on campus around sexual violence at that time or soon before I started. So the issues for the Committee on Student Conduct and some other initiatives that I was involved in really did focus a lot on sexual violence, and in that role within my first year I had been to the Orange County Rape Crisis Center several times because I really wanted to build that relationship with the university. So I would go to the Rape Crisis Center and participate in the volunteer trainings and talk about the university's response, help prepare the rape crisis companions, how, what they might expect if they were helping a survivor through the university discipline processes or other ways the university could support survivors. And that was a really important part of my job. I also was one of the people at UNC that would greet survivors of sexual assault and help them determine what their options were and--. So then seven years into that I was Associate Dean of Students and Judicial Officer. And I had a chance, the Dean of Students had retired, and I had a chance to partially fill in that role for about a year, a year and a half, and I reached a point where I thought I was ready to transition into something different. I had been on one or two non-profit boards and I decided that I was going to consider non-profit management, and I started telling my friends, ""Oh I would really like to work somewhere in non-profit management, maybe somewhere like the Orange County Rape Crisis Center."" So I started quietly telling friends that, just for more of a long-term plan. I wasn't thinking of it as short term. I remember telling one of my best friends, ""oh and I'm going to talk to Margaret Henderson who's the director of Rape Crisis Center and see if I could ever maybe shadow her sometime and see what she does or maybe do even an internship there or something."" And lo and behold, about a week after I start saying all this Margaret Henderson announced she was leaving. And I saw it literally in the paper, which was really strange. And I thought, ""Oh no, now this is something I have to think about and consider a little bit more quickly because obviously I had been very drawn to the work and to the organization and to non-profit work."" And then all of a sudden there's that opportunity there that I really was not--, not necessarily prepared for all aspects of it. I had not had a lot of fundraising or development experience. I had not had huge amounts of financial management experience. But I had been immersed in the issues around sexual violence, and I had done a lot of volunteer training and a lot of work with clients and survivors of sexual violence, and I knew the community and I was part of the system that cared for sexual violence survivors. So there was a big piece of it that I felt real confident about and then there was a big piece of it that I was less certain. And I remember they had a really intense interview process. I had to come and meet with three different groups during that summer, and I remember how supportive Margaret Henderson was when I told her that I was applying, and I'm sure she was probably supportive to everyone who was involved in it if there were other candidates. So after the intensive interview process where I had to write an essay or something--I think the essay was to tell people why I was interested in the job--I ended up getting the job.

It might have been called Women Against Rape. WAR"" SB: WAR, yeah. MB: But I can't remember. As [it] happens now a few student groups changed their names so it would be one acronym.

There were other people in our office, mainly Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and later Don Appiairus because I was the Judicial Officer. So I tended to do a lot of sexual assault to help train about what it was like to go through the student judicial system.

But I wasn't always that direct person and so that was always something that stayed with me that that was an interest I was, I wanted to do more on, which was a big part of what led me to the Rape Crisis Center, bringing it back to OCRCC. And actually when I got to the Rape Crisis Center I do think it was good that I had those university relationships but probably for a good while I needed to focus more on building those community relationships. I look back and it's hard to remember exactly, but I probably did less with the university but more encouraged other staff to partner with the university so that I could focus on building relationships with the County, with the Town of Chapel Hill, Hillsborough, Carrboro, and with other donors like the United Way. I remember spending a lot of time my first couple years with United Way because they were restructuring and you had to be part of several committees with United Way. We got some funding through a children and youth committee and some funding through what I think was a self-sufficiency committee for our client work. So it was interesting.

1512	Barrett, Margaret Bowers	UNCTWMS	1964	1960	NC	White	Graduate or professional degree	Married (except if separated)	RBNF1	2013.0	49	"One of the things that brought me to Rape Crisis was the desire to be more of an advocate. When you're a Judicial Officer, you can't be an advocate. You have to be really balanced and you can support students who are in front of you and you can help them know what their resources are and where they can go, but you have to really balance that, if you're the Judicial Officer, you have to see the whole picture and make sure everybody's getting fair judgment. Honestly, wanting to be more overtly, do more overt advocacy was part of what drew me to the Rape Crisis Center. Because you're always in different roles. SB: Interesting. It's knowing the whole picture, coming to the Rape Crisis Center but you had to know what it was like to be a respond
ng party within the system. That sounds like a really valuable set of experiences. MB: Yeah, I mean it was different. For me it was nice to have more focus on one issue. Sexual violence is obviously broader than one issue. So it's very broad. But coming from UNC I was dealing with academic dishonesty; I was dealing with substance abuse issues, alcohol, sexual violence, student crises, suicide prevention, all of this wide range of issues. And so it was freeing to come and focus more directly on one issue that's really important and that intersects with so many other issues in a lot of ways. And that's one of the things I love about the Rape Crisis Center is that it stayed true to its mission and a really focused mission, and sometimes there's temptations to bring issues together which you do to solve problems, but I think sexual violence especially lends itself to getting submerged if you don't have something that focuses directly on it. So I've been really proud that the Rape Crisis Center has continued to have rape in the name for example. And that was a debate that every once in a while would come up in my years. I think it always does. ""Oh, should we consider changing the name? Should we make it broader?"" And ultimately folks would always go back to the sign on Estes Drive."	"MB: I don't think so. I mean I came in to--, because I was committed to being the Judicial Officer. That was my primary scope of work. I definitely came in to be -- neutral is the wrong word--, but objective.

We were the little house on Estes Drive my whole time there, which is exciting to be here in this nice space on Franklin Street. I still am just amazed when I come in here. And I thought the space on Estes Drive was really nice because the Center had been, I don't know if Margaret Henderson talked to you about that. But they had been in this little old rickety house on Rosemary Street. And so getting the space on Estes Drive was a big deal when Margaret Henderson was there. I had visited there and gone to training. So keeps moving into cleaner, nicer spaces that is good, giving people more of a feeling of self-care, protection, whatever."

And I'll say sometimes well, I went to court before to protect confidentiality. You can trust me. I'm not going to spill your secrets.

And the Rape Crisis Center had been pushing for us to do a better job. By the time I got to UNC they were already pushing for that. That would be interesting research to look back at some of the cases, some of the around 1992, [19]93 you'd find some interesting news articles. SB: Yeah. Right when the student governments started adjudicating cases under the honor system of sexual assault. MB: Yeah, I don't know how far that went back, but yeah it probably went back to the late [19]80s, early [19]90s	MB: I don't stay up on it as much. There used to be more communication, public communication with the folks who were handling the policies directly than I perceive that there is now. But that's just a perception in terms of talking to media and things like that. It seems like over the last few years that's been concentrated at higher levels, and so there's not always as much as much direct communication about what really happens at the student level. So I think that's just a different way of running things than the leadership was running things when I was there. I don't mean the leadership, at the Dean of Students' level--. But seems like the higher levels, that there's less which is ironic because there's also so much social media and that kind of conversation. SB: Like you can follow someone who is head of undergraduate research on Twitter but not--. MB: But maybe not, maybe that person is not going to be empowered to talk to a reporter, which is a different thing. It's like, is social media causing institutions to control their communication more by not having it be a dialogue? I don't know. But we definitely were engaging a lot.

Then there were always other Assistant Deans of Students. There was Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and Ron Binder did Greek Affairs and Judy Barter before Ron Binder, so there were a lot of people in the Dean of Students office. There was also a Sexual Harassment officer who did more of that Title IX because that was more the staff and faculty. So we networked a lot with that office. So yeah, I wasn't doing everything they are doing. I mean they've expanded. Thankfully they have expanded the Dean of Students' office staff, and they have more staff than they had when we were there. But it wasn't easy. It was always twenty-four-seven because there were so many students and so many different expectations. But we didn't have, it sounds so funny but we barely had the internet when I first started. We didn't have email. There was no Facebook. So there were certain things that take a lot of time nowadays that you didn't have then. You had, we were doing paper letters, those kinds of things. It was very, very different. That brings me to the thought when I started at the rape crisis center. Two people on the staff had email, Christina and the Orange County office. Christina in the northern Orange office had it because they had set up her office fairly recently,
in the last year and they wanted her to have email so that she could communicate easily with the staff in Chapel Hill, and Matt may have been the one that had it because he would copy messages for Margaret Henderson."

We didn't have email. There was no Facebook. So there were certain things that take a lot of time nowadays that you didn't have then. You had, we were doing paper letters, those kinds of things. It was very, very different. That brings me to the thought when I started at the rape crisis center. Two people on the staff had email, Christina and the Orange County office. Christina in the northern Orange office had it because they had set up her office fairly recently,
in the last year and they wanted her to have email so that she could communicate easily with the staff in Chapel Hill, and Matt may have been the one that had it because he would copy messages for Margaret Henderson."

There's going to be crisis. They go into homes that aren't adequate. They're exposed to things that most people aren't exposed to at those ages because of the confinement of where they live. They can't escape it, that's the trouble. They can't escape to a place of safety. They're trapped in a four hundred square foot trailer with thin walls so they're exposed to sexual acts, they're exposed to pornography, they're exposed to all kinds of junk that normal children can get away from, they can escape from. These children can't and if you see an abusive situation you'll find that they're trapped even more so because the care givers won't let them out of the environment, so they trap them in a trailer, say. They won't go to daycares, they won't go to preschool, they don't go to Head Start and people never know they're there, so by the time they get into the school system and they've been abused they don't make it, and there's a lot of them.

HC: Oh, yeah, you see a lot of it, and you want to try to get back at the children at an early age, and we focus on two to five, really younger, two to three, to try to give them some self esteem and try to prepare them for crisis as much as possible in a school environment, because that's what their lives are. There's going to be crisis. They go into homes that aren't adequate. They're exposed to things that most people aren't exposed to at those ages because of the confinement of where they live. They can't escape it, that's the trouble. They can't escape to a place of safety. They're trapped in a four hundred square foot trailer with thin walls so they're exposed to sexual acts, they're exposed to pornography, they're exposed to all kinds of junk that normal children can get away from, they can escape from. These children can't and if you see an abusive situation you'll find that they're trapped even more so because the care givers won't let them out of the environment, so they trap them in a trailer, say. They won't go to daycares, they won't go to preschool, they don't go to Head Start and people never know they're there, so by the time they get into the school system and they've been abused they don't make it, and there's a lot of them.

1566	Cravey, Altha J	UNCTWMS	1952	1950	IL	White	Graduate or professional degree	RBNF 1	RBNF1	2013.0	61	So the two things at once have really been important to me this year, about the kinds of issues that especially young women are facing&#8211;young people, but especially young women are facing&#8211;on college campuses. I just thought that was old history. [Laughs] SCB: To give the listeners some context, this spring, and last fall as well, several students have filed complaints against the university and now the university is in the process of revising its sexual assault policies to comply with Title IX and the Clery Act and other nondiscrimination policies, which leads me to another question. You've spent your adult life in a time when Title IX has been implemented, and you spoke just now about how it's interesting to see how we're still struggling with things that should have been over and done. Was Title IX a big event for you, having that in place? AC: Yeah, I was aware of it, but it didn't seem like such a big event. It seemed like part of a larger flow of things, a larger, huge change that I felt was so obvious. So clearly I was aware of that but less aware of the kind of backlash that was happening, less aware of the way things were sliding in a different direction, because in particular I felt like we had won these battles. That is, women had won these battles in the '60s about not re-victimizing survivors of sexual assault. It seemed like we had taught judges and lawyers not to re-victimize survivors in the courtroom and we'd taught even newspapers and mass media these important lessons, and all of a sudden&#8211;. That's why I was so shocked last spring to realize all around me, on a public college campus, these things that I thought were history were very current in terms of re-victimization, and re-victimization by the people I least expected, the university staff. So back to this question, Title IX's forty years old, right, and the Clery Act is twenty years old, so it seemed like those broader kinds of shifts and broader kinds of education that had happened around sexual violence and about re-victimization, it seemed so sad and shocking to me that&#8211;. And apparently on lots and lots of public campuses and private campuses this is happening, this epidemic of rape culture is happening, and being permitted by administrators who'd rather sell their brand and keep things quiet rather than actually protect all students. I don't know, it just kind of&#8211;. [Laughs] I'm still shocked about it. I still don't have a way to make sense of all that, other than that I need to be more historical. [Laughs] I need to develop a better sense of how history changes and how&#8211;. I mean I know it's this dialectical process and you have to keep pushing, I know that, but in another way I obviously don't know that. I obviously can lose sight of that sometimes.	I've got to say, it wasn't just that I was inspired this past spring. I was also shocked that some of the things that I thought were over and done in the '60s were still happening on college campuses. I was really shocked. So the two things at once have really been important to me this year, about the kinds of issues that especially young women are facing&#8211;young people, but especially young women are facing&#8211;on college campuses.

At the same time that I began saying that in the spring of 2009 a videographer by the name of Chad Bonham had asked me would I be a part of this video that he was doing, and I'm like, sure. So I invited him here and he came and we did a video and while he was here he said, ""Do you know Ryan Bomberger?"" I said, ""No, never heard of him. Who's Ryan Bomberger?"" So he told me a little bit of Ryan's story, that Ryan's mother had been raped and she chose adoption rather than abortion, even though abortion was legal at the time she had been raped. So Chad kept urging me, call Ryan, call Ryan, call Ryan, and so he bugged me so much I said, ""Okay, Lord, you must be telling me to call Ryan."" So I did and he and I had a lunch. That was in like April, May of 2009. In October of 2009 I had said to Ryan, ""If our children were animals they'd be on the endangered species list,"" and he said, ""I say that all the time,"" and I'm like, yeah, because it's true.

We talk a lot, but we don't always take action. But it was incredible. It was an incredible part of the foundation of women's awakening, if you will. And I think that some of the women's work that I did in the [19]80s and '90s was that way, too. It was kind of, women opening up to each other and being able to say things they couldn't say anywhere else. It was pretty important stuff."	"GE: Yeah. I started one in California, in San Francisco. There was one group of us, a small group there. A couple of women were flight attendants. Actually, almost all the women I knew either were, or had been, flight attendants. And in fact, I have two friends now who I've known since we were flight attendants together, who I'm still friends with. They both live on the west coast, they both live in the Seattle area. It's funny. And one of them who had been my roommate, her daughters are my godchildren. So we still have that connection. So all the women either were, or had been, flight attendants, who were in this consciousness-raising group. And some of that was also from the union, because some of the women in the union, some of the women I flew with who were in the union, and who were active in the union were more political. And truthfully, it was San Francisco, and so probably as a group we were more feisty and political than some of the other places. So anyway, yeah, we had a consciousness-raising group there. And then when I came back here, I started one here. I think those were really big. I think those were really--. It's hard. This probably sounds inflated and pompous to say that they we were really revolutionary, but in a way they really were. Because it was the only time, for all of us, it was the only time we ever really got to talk about those, or had a chance to even explore with each other, ""Gee, have you ever been to the doctor and they did this to you?"" Or talking about people who had been sexually abused, or raped--. I mean, that was never, ever talked about. So it truly was a liberating experience for people to be able to talk about that with each other, and find out that we had so many things in common, as far as those experiences as women. And the sad part of it was that often it didn't go anywhere. You just shared all that, and then you felt personally empowered, but it didn't necessarily lead to any action, which is always the case with us, with ""lefties,"" right?

1584	Garcia, Serena	UNCTWMS	1971	1970	GA	Two or More Races	Graduate or professional degree	RBNF 1	RBNF1	2011.0	40	"Right after that is when I decided that I wanted to start having consensual sex, and so again the early feminist in me decided to choose my own partner. I chose my own partner. It wasn't someone I was in love with, it wasn't someone that I felt very intimately about or was in love with or had any kind of romantic relationship [with]. There was someone that I thought would be the best fit for me, no pun intended. So I went up to my male friend and said, ""I'm ready to have sex tomorrow, and if you're ready, let's get condoms and let's go."" He looked at me and said, ""Well don't you want the sweet romantic stuff and the candles and the soft music and the Keith Sweat playing in the background?"" I said, ""Keith Sweat is not needed. I'm ready to have consensual sex and either you're going to be my partner or I'm going to find somebody else,"" and he said, ""Okay, well I guess I'll go ahead [Laughs] and get myself together."" So that was yet again another instance of being sexually liberated, even outside of being a survivor of child sexual molestation. I was able to yet again find a way to empower myself and take control of my sexuality, and my health also by going to my dad and announcing to him very strongly and boldly, ""I need to be on the pill and I need for you to take me. You haven't done anything else for me. I need you to do this."	"I had a godmother, a black woman, who was very much in her senior years. At that time seniors would be more than willing to take care of neighborhood kids. At the same time there were certain things that, if they felt like they had trust of other people who were around them, they just did. This person that's in their family, they just know they can trust them. They would think that the perpetrators would be living down the street or homeless or someone who may have a mental illness or someone who is a substance abuser. So I was very much protected by the outside community, but as we know, in 2011, oftentimes the perpetrator is not going to be that same stranger from down the street or somebody that you just come in contact with. Sometimes and oftentimes it's going to be someone that you know and someone who's been brought into the family. When you look at some of the stories that Anne Rice [author of the novel, Interview with the Vampire] created for the New Orleans area and you look at the entr&#233;e of the vampire, [for] the vampire to come into a person's home, that person has to open the door. The person has to open the door, and the same thing happened with me. By virtue of me not having the protective systems in place, the door was open for the vampire to come in. When the vampire comes in then, they prey. That's what they do. So that's exactly what happened. I was eight years old and it went on continuously, with this one person who was a relative of my godmother, for the next two years. So I suffered in silence, and to be very honest, at that age, the way that I rationalized what was happening""I knew it was wrong""but when I looked at the situation at eight years old and saw how me and my grandmother were living, which was not extreme poverty but still very low income to where we couldn't afford certain services or health care or a car or air conditioning or things like that. Because she had to work so much to try to take care of our rent and she was often gone, [I was] in the care of the landlord sometimes, and the landlord was the relative of my godmother, and they had a son that was considerably older than me. He was already a young man when I was only eight years old. So by my godmother thinking that this family member was going to be someone that she could trust and that we could trust, oftentimes when she turned her back she put me in the care of him and delivered me right into the hands of the vampire. So that meant complete and full access. But because his father was our landlord, I felt the responsibility for maintaining our house was bent on me taking the responsibility for providing for the needs that he had in mind. Even though they were wrong needs, I still felt like it was my responsibility to keep a roof over our head, and so that's why I didn't say anything. That's why I didn't tell. CGD: So what happened to stop the abuse at ten? SG: He finally moved away. It wasn't going to stop on its own. I didn't have the wherewithal to stop it and I was too fearful to tell the family. For one, for fear of us losing our home, and number two, for fear of them not believing me. I'm this little biracial child who has extremely low value in the community as it is, so what value do I have? This is my thinking at eight years old, obviously, and so the only reason why it stopped was because he went to college. That was the only reason why it stopped. That was the only reason why it stopped, and I didn't disclose it to my family on my mother's side until I was getting ready to graduate from high school. There was a mental blockage of it for some number of years. Sometimes when children go through extreme psycholog[ical] trauma they block things out. They block out memories in their mind, and they're blocked out for so long. As I began my teenage years, becoming a young woman, I think the way that began to manifest itself was in substance abuse. That's how it began to manifest itself. It didn't manifest itself in terms of sexual promiscuity by any means. I was extremely selective and very protective about that. In fact after the first time that I had sex with someone I went to my dad immediately and told him that he needed to get me on the birth control pill like tomorrow, because I'd just started having sex last night. After my dad passed out"". [Laughs] CGD: How old were you? SG: I was sixteen. I was sixteen years old and I gained strength sometime during that time frame, as I mentioned to you before, to confront my perpetrator. I found the strength to do that after I had enlisted into the military and I knew what I was going to do with my life and I felt empowered somehow. I saw him on the street one day. He came back and I saw him and stopped him, and I very boldly announced to him, ""You're not going to do this again. You had the opportunity to do it without any consent from me whatsoever, but I'm sixteen years old now. It's been eight years; I dare you to try now. I dare you to try it now. I'm taking everything back and I'm not going to be silent anymore. I'm going to start telling people about it, and you can call me a liar if you want to but it's the truth. I'm not going to allow you or any other man or any other person to silence me again and take my liberties from me. I'm going to always put that in the forefront of my agenda from now on, so thank you for that."" Right after that is when I decided that I wanted to start having consensual sex, and so again the early feminist in me decided to choose my own partner. I chose my own partner. It wasn't someone I was in love with, it wasn't someone that I felt very intimately about or was in love with or had any kind of romantic relationship [with]. There was someone that I thought would be the best fit for me, no pun intended. So I went up to my male friend and said, ""I'm ready to have sex tomorrow, and if you're ready, let's get condoms and let's go."" He looked at me and said, ""Well don't you want the sweet romantic stuff and the candles and the soft music and the Keith Sweat playing in the background?"" I said, ""Keith Sweat is not needed. I'm ready to have consensual sex and either you're going to be my partner or I'm going to find somebody else,"" and he said, ""Okay, well I guess I'll go ahead [Laughs] and get myself together."" So that was yet again another instance of being sexually liberated, even outside of being a survivor of child sexual molestation. I was able to yet again find a way to empower myself and take control of my sexuality, and my health also by going to my dad and announcing to him very strongly and boldly, ""I need to be on the pill and I need for you to take me. You haven't done anything else for me. I need you to do this. At least protect me from having children that I know I can't take care of."" My grandmother was completely against the idea of me being on the pill because she was Catholic and so she was very much a conservative[ly] minded woman from the standpoint of family planning and pregnancy prevention. So I went to somebody who I knew would say yes. I cornered him [Laughs] into saying yes. So that was my upbringing, coming up as a young woman."

So either you adopt one or the other or you try to blend them together and it's very difficult and complicated in a sense. But we have a lot of our women that get sexually abused. We have a lot of domestic violence. When you look at the statistics it is two and three times higher than the national average. We can't even get the protection until President Obama signed the Tribal Law and Order Act, and that is so that more and more protection will be provided to the Native Americans. I don't know the exact statistics but I think when they did the ceremony, when he signed it, the woman that spoke and told a bit of her story there at the press conference, it's three out of five women will be sexually assaulted and raped throughout her lifetime and a high percentage will experience domestic violence. It's horrendous.	When the Europeans came here and the women showed up with the men to talk the Europeans were indignant and just appalled that the women were viewed as equals, and of course in the European mindset that meant that we were weak instead of balanced. So adopting this dominant way of life and thinking, this patriarchal mindset, and of course with Western values we don't think any different than the non-natives in a sense; therefore our women have experienced a great deal of abuse, being viewed as second class. You have to remember that even though we are a tribe and of a sovereign nation we live the same way as everybody else does under the same dominant Western values, and that to me I think is what is really difficult, because when you try to apply tribal ways and values and beliefs it's conflictual with Western values and beliefs.

Instead of social problems being fixed, prisons have become a solution to fix social ills when the fact is that when you have poverty and these systems of oppression of place and not the willingness to really deconstruct and smash them prisons will only be places to hold people, and it doesn't work. I think it's hard because it's ingrained that prisons are for bad people. It do
s make it a hard story to have people understand, that no matter what people's situations, no matter what they've done, people don't deserve inhumane treatment. That we have to agree that a pregnant woman having a belly chain at nine months around her belly and around her ankles and wrists is too much. Women, when we're telling our stories, you need to believe us, that, ""It hurts, it's inhumane, it shouldn't happen,"" should be enough. We are in the fifth year of this campaign to pass our bill.

"The other, I talked a little bit when I was in class the other night about this chasm between women's studies at that point. This was late 80s into the early 90s and the activist feminist community. The activist feminists were working on nitty gritties like battered women's shelters and rape crises and the needs of incest survivors and survivors of child sexual abuse were just being known. The Courage to Heal had just come out. This was huge. The recovery movement was just getting going and was huge. And the university was off doing very very intellectual very very removed deconstruction, post-feminist theory. SR: Right. MI: Several of my friends said, ""I'll be a post-feminist in a post-patriarchy."" There were people with a foot in both worlds.

I'm telling you this out of chronological order because it matters in the scheme of things.

She just needed to tell somebody because she walked into the dorm crying, distraught, what have you. So I said, ""Oh we can do something."" She said ""Well, I don't want to do anything.""

So every county is served by a rape crisis center but there are about sixty-three court agencies that have offices in about ninety-two counties. But then they have staff covering the other eight counties that there are not a physical of...ce for sexual assault. So they provide direct services which is what I did in Scotland County for many years. But we do the training for those advocates. We also do law 
nforcement training on sexual assault specifically so impact of sexual Violence, prevalence and how to interview sexual assault survivors. We also train sexual assault nurse examiners forensic nurses on evidence collection and the importance of the survivor because what they do is scientific and what we do is let them know that that is a human being that is the evidence. And so we provide training there. We also provide training for anybody who needs it. We have a campus consortium which now we have probably over forty campuses who are a part of our campus consortium so they have their own advisory committee of campuses and we provide prevention training to them and with them because a lot of them now have federal grants that they have at their school universities to do sexual Violence or domestic Violence preventions; but we do the sexual assault side ofthings. And we also work with all of the state agencies on writing model policies. So we just wrote a policy on new research because I wrote one in 99. There wasn't a lot of research but now there's lots of research. And we also have an administration, our presidential administration who has this as a priority issue. So of course it helps to have the Vice 24 Monika Iohnson-Hostler president that has a, ""One is too many,"" website on sexual assault that happens on college campuses. So that's a huge initiative for us, which we want to work on with the department of public health. You all interviewed the council for women so you all know they're a funder and we are, statutorily the coalition provides training to the agencies that they fund which are the rape crisis centers. So they fund direct services and we train direct service providers. So there is a lot ofturnover because now that I'm older I know that they really don't make a lot of money to do work that is stressful and that absolutely has a high turnover and burnout rate. I just did my ...rst career fair at my daughter's elementary school and I realized this is not a career that anyone will ever tell you that you can ever have. So I'm looking in her yearbook and it actually has where I work, but they asked me to come talk about being a non-pro...t director and I said, ""Well that is really great of them to put where I work,"" because now somebody knows that is a career. Because even in college this isn't a career choice you'd think that you would do. Even women's studies majors, a lot of them think about policy which is now where I now spend the bulk of my time. So that's what we do our work revolves around training and education for direct service providers whether they are rape crisis centers or we call them allied professionals or first responders who would be involved in a sexual assault case, and then campuses. But we also do prevention work, which is also training people how to do prevention so society systematically understands that it is our job to change to prevent children from being sexually abused, not children and not just singularly parents but systems are also a part of that. So we do systems work as 25 Monika Iohnson-Hostler well which is mostly translated into policy. So we do both state and federal policy and so, which there will be a trend here. So in that I'm also the chair of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, which I have been for, my daughter's six so almost six years. I know that's a long time to be a chair [all laugh]. But it is a policy making body so all of our work and there's no staff so we're all volunteer so I tell people my 6-10 job which is when I leave here is to work with federal policy. That is in both writing and advocating for it, and that advocacy isn't just to Congress on the importance of passing legislation but it's also to agencies so that they understand why it's important that the policy governs their work. So that's my current focus, as a public policy in legislation."	"So at NC CASA we're a statewide organization that is a membership organization for the ninety plus rape crisis centers in North Carolina. So every county is served by a rape crisis center but there are about sixty-three court agencies that have offices in about ninety-two counties. But then they have staff covering the other eight counties that there are not a physical of...ce for sexual assault. So they provide direct services which is what I did in Scotland County for many years. But we do the training for those advocates. We also do law 
nforcement training on sexual assault specifically so impact of sexual Violence, prevalence and how to interview sexual assault survivors. We also train sexual assault nurse examiners forensic nurses on evidence collection and the importance of the survivor because what they do is scientific and what we do is let them know that that is a human being that is the evidence. And so we provide training there. We also provide training for anybody who needs it. We have a campus consortium which now we have probably over forty campuses who are a part of our campus consortium so they have their own advisory committee of campuses and we provide prevention training to them and with them because a lot of them now have federal grants that they have at their school universities to do sexual Violence or domestic Violence preventions; but we do the sexual assault side ofthings. And we also work with all of the state agencies on writing model policies. So we just wrote a policy on new research because I wrote one in 99. There wasn't a lot of research but now there's lots of research. And we also have an administration, our presidential administration who has this as a priority issue. So of course it helps to have the Vice 24 Monika Iohnson-Hostler president that has a, ""One is too many,"" website on sexual assault that happens on college campuses. So that's a huge initiative for us, which we want to work on with the department of public health. You all interviewed the council for women so you all know they're a funder and we are, statutorily the coalition provides training to the agencies that they fund which are the rape crisis centers. So they fund direct services and we train direct service providers. So there is a lot ofturnover because now that I'm older I know that they really don't make a lot of money to do work that is stressful and that absolutely has a high turnover and burnout rate. I just did my ...rst career fair at my daughter's elementary school and I realized this is not a career that anyone will ever tell you that you can ever have. So I'm looking in her yearbook and it actually has where I work, but they asked me to come talk about being a non-pro...t director and I said, ""Well that is really great of them to put where I work,"" because now somebody knows that is a career. Because even in college this isn't a career choice you'd think that you would do. Even women's studies majors, a lot of them think about policy which is now where I now spend the bulk of my time. So that's what we do our work revolves around training and education for direct service providers whether they are rape crisis centers or we call them allied professionals or first responders who would be involved in a sexual assault case, and then campuses.

1651	Judy, Rebecca Ann	UNCTWMS	1940	1940	TN	White	Graduate or professional degree	Married (except if separated)	2	2011.0	71	"I was not as active on the local level, but I joined NOW and all those good old great ones and became a real advocate for not just social workers, but women in those positions, women in the field. So that's been my focus all these years. I'm a very verbal person, and so I made lots of speeches when I was with-the next program that I worked in in Child and Family was the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. So that included, as I shared with you on the phone, I think, that agency had sort of a research project that started with setting up a helpline in 1979. The helpline was for women and children to call in and report just to the helpline or just to talk about their abuse, primarily sexual abuse was the target. And that meant any women that had been sexually abused as a child or were still or had been raped or a child that had been molested or somehow been offended sexually. So that sort of experiment or, in research terms, sort of out there to gather data, that following next year, the referrals to the Department of Human Services went up four hundred percent. So that data was used to support getting the funding for a regional research and service delivery system for abuse victims and so that's where the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. It's an unwieldy name, but PASAAC, and I was clinical supervisor there for six years. So I did a lot of speaking at that time throughout the southeast. And what we did was try to get the various parts of the systems that deal with abuse to talk to each other. Police-if a rape was reported, how do they talk to the victim? What kind of services were available at the emergency center, the emergency rooms? Of course, the Department of Human Services that gave services to children, often they weren't communicating with anybody. The sheriff's department, the police, all of those people needed to coordinate services and learn how to not do further damage because the interrogation, particularly around rape, man, it was almost as bad as the rape sometimes for women. So we advocated strongly for that to change and for a more humane, more private inquiry, and did a lot of training throughout the southeast all the way from Texas to South Carolina, Florida. JW: Was there openness to that kind of change or what was that process like? RJ: What was that process? (laughs) Well, the big resistance, you can imagine, was from [males].We wanted to include doctors and many physicians would not, were the most resistant group. And I'm not sure why that was. I think a lot of that was because there weren't very many women physicians at that point. And I think that, number one, a lot of men had not been trained to really see rape as [a crime]. They saw it as, well, did she have any injuries, was she pregnant, and that's it, and not any of the psychological impact of being assaulted that way. JW: Were you trying to get them to report cases? RJ: Yes, definitely trying to get, well, trying to help them help the victim, to take charge, and to talk about it. A lot of women still won't talk about being raped because back then, of course, there was very anti-female [attitude]. First of all, rape didn't exist. Number two, if you were raped, you asked for it, you wanted it, because you wore that skirt too short or you were being seductive or you didn't say ""no"" loud enough. Why did you finally give in? Nobody can [be raped]. It was a lot of old boy things: ""Well, nobody gets raped. If you don't want to have sex then you just say no."" But the fact that the man was two hundred and fifty pounds and the woman was a hundred had nothing to do with it. So there was a lot of denial of inequities, physical strength and intimidation, and then the women often felt so guilty and so dirty. All she wanted to do was forget it, and so there was not much follow-up for the mental health [treatment]. So as the next project that I worked on, as clinic supervisor at the Sexual Assault Center, which was an agency designed specifically to work with women and children. [The] women that had been sexually assaulted or had been sexually abused as children and were still dealing with the trauma. So I ran a group for nine years for women that had been sexually assaulted or had reoccurring memories. The whole memory thing got really to be an issue. And then, of course, I had staff that worked with children that had been abused, a lot of play therapy and those kinds of things. JW: And what year did you start that? RJ: Oh gosh. I left Child and Family in '86-no, I started in private practice in '86. I left Child and Family in '84. I went with Overlook Mental Health Center for a couple years and then I went in private practice. And when I went in private practice in '86, then that's when I associated also with the Sexual Assault Center. There was three of us on staff, four on staff at the time and so I was the clinical supervisor and then we started adding staff. I was there for fifteen years on some level. JW: So how were you learning to counsel people through this when, like you said, rape didn't exist? You were part of that movement to say, ""Wait a second. It does."" RJ: It does exist and it has more than physical impact on the victim. Well, how were we learning that? Well, learning how to be a counselor, quote, therapist. Counseling usually is around solving problems, defining problems and solving problems in a real sort of one, two, three way. That's my definition. Now therapy is a much longer and more in-depth look at how you reacted to the problem on an emotional level and what that did to your mental health. What has it done? Do you find yourself depressed, staying in bed all day long, or continuing to get into self-destructive, abusive relationships? That takes a long time to figure out how to break those patterns and we're now learning a whole lot more about the brain. If I had time to go, I'd be a neurologist. I would study that and how to educate people to train their brain differently. We know that can happen now. We have the technology, and we have the expertise. But anyway, back to how do you learn how to deal with somebody about a behavior or an event that supposedly doesn't happen. (laughs) Well, the first thing you do is say, ""It does happen."" And again, since we're products of our culture, you have to do a lot of work on yourself, or at least I did, in saying, ""Yeah, that happens and yes, it's not good and yes, most of the victims are women, but also little boys get raped and vulnerable males also get raped."" So you have to sort of retrain your own thinking about that and disconnect yourself from the common belief system. It has some service in the community to deny certain things and so you have to figure out, okay, if I rock the boat, what happens? What role do I play? It's like the whole thing with women, the women's movement. There was this thought that women, you can have it all. You can't have it all. You have to make choices. You can't be the CEO of a multimillion-dollar corporation and be there every time your kid has a fever. You can't do it. So you make choices."

Has this mostly been a positive story of success? RJ: Well, in some ways for some people it has. I think there's still a lot of, and I'm thinking of just a great influence on people's attitudes on sex generally and then, concomitant of that, the misuse of sex to control somebody, which is essentially [abuse]. Rape is not about sex. It's about violence and control, because if you want to have good sex, you don't rape. And sexual overtures to a child essentially, those people, in my humble opinion, do not have power any place else or they don't feel powerful in any place else. So it's not about the use of your sexual self for pleasure or for connection. It's about violence, psychological violence if not physical violence, on another person. So how have we changed? I'm not so sure that television and popular media doesn't sometimes glorify non-consensual sex and it certainly, I don't think, creates enough distaste for prostitution and those areas that females get entrapped maybe. I know that some of your audience would probably say, ""Well, there's choice there too."" Anyway, so we've both been changing toward appreciation for the individual and individual choice and for women, but we've also degraded, to some degree, the whole process of sexuality and made it entertainment and/or a power play.

That's really sad. So maybe it's the power in the human family that's the culprit, not necessarily discrimination based on male-female, but it's on the power group versus the un-empowered. It's possible for us to destroy ourselves as a species. So have we made progress? I don't know, but the human community is very slow. Again, I think our brain is slow to change.

I'm coming to sexual harassment, but actually what you might think would be harder, we got that first that way. On the sexual harassment thing, I was on a committee of the AEP [Affirmative Employment Program] and we looked at policies at various schools and drafted one, and that's probably dated in the 1980s, and again that's all we've got and that's become an issue. Okay, so at least we got something done, and it was that we were not successful, let's say, in getting the administration to put one in but we could come in the back way and say we're proposing this, so it's coming from the side, if you will. Then you'd encounter all these people saying things like, ""But that's how I met my wife. That's how I met my husband. You're denying us the opportunity."" [Laughs] Well just keep your pants zipped up and wait a little while. It'll work. JF: [Laughs] SK: But you can't say those things. So Cheryl Travis and I have been talking about updating that policy because she's been working on some stuff in the psychology department and I've been trying to get the AEP to retake it up as an issue, to update it and make it more powerful, because what it is, is it's very weak. It's a weak statement as it's written because that's what we could get accepted, but ultimately you have to be strategically political. It's better to have something that you can build on than have nothing. It doesn't have enough clout in it, if you will. So, yeah, that's one of our current projects, is to try and do that, and Cheryl [Travis] and I have published together on sexual harassment. It's been a topic of interest. Certainly in the field of psychology it's rampant. [Laughs] I mean in that professors exploiting graduate women has been talked about for decades and continues. JF: What was the resistance to a stronger sexual harassment policy? SK: Well it always starts from the kind of thing of sort of denying people the right to meet other people, as I said: That's how I met my husband; that's how I met my wife. That I think underneath it all is the idea of, you know, sort of like with rape, that there'd be false accusation, that there'd be misunderstandings. But overall institutions are not keen on dealing with sexual harassment, so I spent eight or nine years as the ombudsperson for students on campus and obviously encountered students who had various problems, and I discovered that the institution basically wants them to go away, okay. So they don't want there to be action taken against somebody for sexual harassment; they want them to leave, or the student to leave, or whatever, okay, because that's the whole problem with a lot of the policies that you have to sort of protect people, is that the institution's really at heart trying to protect itself and so they're not going to be supportive of things that would ever sort of make it public or lead to lawsuits or whatever.

DL: And I didn't care--. Some of us didn't care very much about the laws that were not just, [Laughs] so we sort of ignored stuff that put people at risk, but we also began acting to change those laws. We were going at it from every direction because we knew we had to change policy laws; that this had to happen. I mean we were going to be out here in the woods unless this happened, so we were busting our ovaries. We were in people's faces; we set up committees; we'd disseminate information. One of my first paying jobs was--. At that first national conference we organized what we called the Southeast Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which was all the southeast states, and we were able too--. We had some funding, who could have believed it, and I was hired as the coordinator for the Southeast Coalition, so I spent two years--. I worked out of UT, UT was my fiscal sponsor--[1:16:31]--and I spent two years traveling the southeast, sharing policy, sharing legislation, training boards of directors, training advocates, keynote speaking at conferences, or whatever. For two years that's what I did, and we got all the states up and running. We did some good work"
1668	Levy, Dianne	UNCTWMS	1947	1940		White	Some college	RBNF 1	RBNF1	2010.0	63	"I had a woman friend, her name was Johnnie Ray, so we would help each other, and she was a country woman, the real thing. I'm the real thing now, but I wasn't then. She was very helpful to me and taught me a lot of good stuff and we worked in each other's fields. Let me tell you this; this is an important story. So, I don't know if you know Grassy Fork or that area. Back thirty or forty years ago""all the roads back in there are paved now, which amuses me since my road isn't paved and that's much more of a road""but it was really a remote section of the county and it was very rough roads. Nothing was paved back in there, which made me happy. I was happy to disappear into the woods. At the fork of the road I lived on there was a cement block building which was probably maybe the size of like the front of the house to the end of the house, maybe thirty feet long and maybe sixteen feet wide. It had a back door and it had a front door and it had two front windows and that was it. There was nothing to it. I was coming out one day and I saw Johnnie's truck parked there so I stopped and looked in and there she was, and I said, ""What are you doing?"" because she had a farm and four kids and she had a son-of-a-bitch for a husband, too. Oh, [Laughs] and I had done the same thing with Johnnie Ray one day. I was out at her place or she'd come down to me and Johnnie had all this stuff all over her arms, and I said, ""Johnnie, have you got ringworm or did you run into some poison, or what's going on with you?"" She looked at me like I was really an idiot and she said, ""Those are bruises."" It turns out that her husband, Paul was just--. He was a drunk and he was the kind that used drink as an excuse and I mean he raped and pillaged and beat. I'm sure he raped all of his kids, not to mention Johnnie, and beat her and the kids to a bloody pulp time and time again. Also, lucky for me, he was also a cop fighter so that was greatly in our favor because he fought cops and cops don't like cop fighters. Anyway, I'd already found out about the bruising and when I stopped at that building that day and said, ""What are you doing here?"" she said, ""That's a steel door, steel door, got bars over both those windows, and he can't burn this building."" And so she rented that little building probably for about thirty bucks a month, I don't know, not much. I don't know if there was an outhouse there. It was electric, there was an electric line and she had a refrigerator. She had a little counter not as big as this table and on the counter she had like two loaves of light bread and three onions and some bananas and some Beanie Weenies or something. That was her stock from the store. [Sighs] Many a night Johnnie would run out of the house, grab the kids, and she'd lock herself in that building, many, many a night. So, it was Christmas day 1975, probably 2:00 in the afternoon maybe, and I had a call. It was Gracie, one of her daughters, and I guess Gracie was nine. She said, ""Mama says come quick."" So I jumped in my little VW bug, and she lived probably, I don't know, maybe five miles up the mountain from me. I got up there in time and there was a deputy up there. So Christmas Eve they'd finished the tree and got all the presents out and they were waiting for Paul to come home, and he never came home that night. The next morning they waited for him to come home all morning to open presents and he didn't come home. They went ahead and opened presents, and they waited and waited on Christmas dinner for him to come home and he didn't come home, and they'd been up all night, so they eat Christmas dinner early and they ate dinner, and she had fallen asleep. Johnnie had fallen asleep on the couch and she woke up and he was standing over her with a knife at her throat saying, ""You're going to die, bitch."" Johnnie was a strong woman, she'd been fighting him for years, and he was drunk, and so they struggled and struggled and struggled. And Gracie went into the bedroom and got the pistol that Johnnie kept loaded under her pillow, because it wasn't the first time this had happened, and Gracie threw the pistol across the room, tossed it across the room to Johnnie--I mean you can just imagine it, screaming [1:02:24]--and Johnnie caught the pistol and it went off. Now he's got the--I mean he's after her with the knife. The bullet slices right through here and gets his--aorta? Is that what it is? And so he was bleeding to death. She called the law and called the ambulance and blah, blah, blah, but he died. I got up there in time. The ambulance had just left and the deputy was just waiting for me to get up there so I could keep the kids so they could haul her off, and they hauled her off to jail, Christmas day, hauled her off to jail, charged her with first degree murder, manslaughter. I think they released her late that night because I think we had the kids back to her the next day. So she was charged with murder, and she was convicted of murder, even though it was clearly self defense. They didn't think anything about convicting her for murder, and then they let her go. And they laughed about it because Paul was a cop fighter and he'd had big fights with the cops for years and they hated him and he was always dangerous to them, too. They would make jokes about it: ""Good going, Johnnie!"" and stuff like that. Well she was devastated. I mean the more you suffer the more emotional attachment you have. They'd been abused for years horribly, but that d
esn't mean the emotional attachment isn't there. It was horrible for her, convicted of murdering her husband who she hated and loved, and being joked about at the courthouse about, ""Good going,"" you know, ""That's great!"" They'd pat her on the back; horrible. I discovered in that time that there were no laws [Laughs] to protect family members. Basically a man could assault his family at will, rape, beat, terrorize, whatever he wanted to do, and the law and the preachers and everybody went, oh, well that's his business."

It was a good building and they were going to tear this building down, but they weren't going to tear it down for two years. But they evicted everybody.

You had to occupy it totally for thirty days and then all this legal stuff came in and you could pretty much be there for the year.

They had accused this black of raping a woman, or something, one of those episodes, and they ran every black out of the county, took over their farms and whatever and they had to move. I was told stories about how they hung blacks around the courthouse. I know they at least lynched the guy that they were accusing of this, and I don't know how many others. Some people maybe have done some research on it, but the stories were told. I could just see bodies hanging all around the courthouse in my mind as to what happened. So it was kind of a really [pause] horror. And then blacks coming in through the town on trucks to deliver stuff to the stores were afraid to get out of the truck. They would hide in the back of the truck. I found this to be just horrifying, but somehow I never quite got it connected with doing anything about it or thinking about it in that way.

1681	Mashburn, Lillian Tauxe	UNCTWMS	1943	1940	TN	White	Bachelor's degree	Married (except if separated)	2	2011.0	68	LM: I think one of the things that's interested me is how men began to change attitudes as their daughters graduated from college and started looking for jobs. I saw a sea change in attitude because their girls were facing what a lot of the rest of us had faced. I think it became clear that the path was not get a college degree, get married, and have babies. So I think there became a change that started in the late [19]70s and continued. I'm proud of what we did. I am very disgusted, angry, frustrated over what I see is part of a religious-seeming religious, I guess, I don't know where it's all coming from-of trying to put the genie back in the bottle, trying to put women back into--. And they're using Roe v. Wade and birth control and all. I don't know if it's a generational situation where people are fearful, but I feel like some of the things that we accomplished, we're losing. I mean, to pass a bill that requires the IRS to look into the tax situation of women who have been raped, there's something sick going on. When Congress is spending all this time and our state legislature all this time on all of these non-issues, it's like the war on women. That's what some people are calling it, and I think that's very accurate. I think the war on teachers is almost a war on women. You espouse education as important and, yet, you're trying to take rights away from teachers. I don't get it. So I'm very angry about that because I think we're trying to step back to a time--. And people keep talking about, oh, how it was in the [19]50s. Well, bullshit. (laughs) The '50s were not the be [all] and [end] all. I think women were stuck in family situations. They didn't have the independence to get out of abusive situations. There was no women's crisis center, women's sexual assault center. There was no support network in that era.

I am very disgusted, angry, frustrated over what I see is part of a religious-seeming religious, I guess, I don't know where it's all coming from-of trying to put the genie back in the bottle, trying to put women back into--. And they're using Roe v. Wade and birth control and all. I don't know if it's a generational situation where people are fearful, but I feel like some of the things that we accomplished, we're losing. I mean, to pass a bill that requires the IRS to look into the tax situation of women who have been raped, there's something sick going on. When Congress is spending all this time and our state legislature all this time on all of these non-issues, it's like the war on women. That's what some people are calling it, and I think that's very accurate. I think the war on teachers is almost a war on women. You espouse education as important and, yet, you're trying to take rights away from teachers. I don't get it. So I'm very angry about that because I think we're trying to step back to a time--. And people keep talking about, oh, how it was in the [19]50s. Well, bullshit. (laughs) The '50s were not the be [all] and [end] all. I think women were stuck in family situations. They didn't have the independence to get out of abusive situations. There was no women's crisis center, women's sexual assault center. There was no support network in that era.

I think I ran into more sexual harassment from Protestant clergy than I did in any other job I've ever had. But no, religion in some ways is okay for women to play in. It depends on how seriously they take you, and I wasn't trying to be a minister, although I did participate with the Knoxville Ministerial Association and served on some committees there. I ended up getting involved with the Chamber of Commerce. In that place, the only way a woman could gain any kind of leverage was to sell memberships, and I ended up being the first woman honorary life member of the Knoxville Chamber and earned my stripes that way.

1688	Morrow, Sarah Taylor	UNCTWMS	1921	1920	NC	White	Graduate or professional degree	Widowed	6	2010.0	89	MORROW: Medicaid, being federally funded, had to comply with any federal rules. And my recollection is that the federal funding for the abortion issue was in cases of rape or threatened life of the mother. One of my concerns here in North Carolina was not only rape and risk of life of the mother, but incest. I felt that as long as it was legally right for the wealthy women to have abortions, that it should be legally right for poor women to have abortions. Poor women who could afford another mouth to feed even less than the rich, and so I persuaded the legislature to appropriate some state funds for abortions so that--. For example, thirteen, fourteen-year-old girls who got pregnant, and sometimes it was incest in the family, and they had no business first of all in getting pregnant, but they didn't have control over it because its usually the male in the family who has control there. And secondly, they should not be forced to have a baby at that young age. So I thought we needed to have some state funds to abort these youngsters. And so the legislature, even though many of them were very opposed to abortion, they still felt that, you know--. They felt, I think, the same as I did, that to force a teenager to have a pregnancy and carry it through and have a baby that she was not able to take care of was not an appropriate thing to have happen. So our legislature, as I recall, appropriated two-hundred-thousand dollars in state funds for abortions for poor women, which would cover, of course, incest, rape, and risk of life of the mother, just as the federal government did, but it might cover some other situations where the pregnancy existed and was not needed nor wanted. It's a shame that we can't prevent unwanted pregnancies altogether, but the sex drive apparently is such a strong one for procreation that it alters behavior, especially if alcohol or any other kinds of drugs are involved. So I think it's much more desirable to prevent unwanted pregnancies than it is to have to deal with them after pregnancy has occurred.

1694	Parsons, Darlene	UNCTWMS	1953	1950	MA	White	Bachelor's degree	Married (except if separated)	3	2014.0	61	"So my faith was becoming more and more strong as I sought, and I also became more comfortable with a little doubt on the edges, because all of us doubt, and I also believe God's big enough to handle our doubt. So what happened was a woman came to my house and said, ""I need to tell you a story."" She said, ""My son&#8211;."" We had heard that a pedophile who was associated with Providence Baptist had been arrested &#8211; and by the way he's serving thirteen years &#8211; and that he had molested a fair number of young teen boys, and he had been a volunteer [from the] seminary and he worked with all the youth. EF: The seminary in Raleigh? DP: Yeah, Southeastern Seminary. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to&#8211;. EF: Oh, that's okay. DP: Assume Southeastern when I talk about more fundamentalism, alright? EF: Okay, got it. DP: That might help. EF: Sure. DP: He molested kids, and I found out how bad, and I wanted to tell you that, as a nurse who had worked with child sex abuse victims, this was amongst some of the worst sexual abuse I have ever heard in my life. I can't even speak of it, it makes me so sick. This young man, who was fourteen at the time, and his name is Aaron &#8211; he's very
out about his name &#8211; was at a summer camp and the guy, he was in a cabin with him, and the guy &#8211; and forgive me if this is X-rated &#8211; was encouraging them to do circle masturbation. He was shocked. He's fourteen years old. He went to the pastors and told them this, this is a year before the arrest, and they decided not to believe him. They said he was exaggerating and that this seminary student &#8211; Doug Goodrich, he was in the news &#8211; that Doug said, ""Oh, it's locker room humor. This is what we were doing and he's exaggerating it."" His parents came in and met with them and they ignored it and, not only then, but then he was actually put on probation for six weeks, the parents weren't told, because he was taking them to some pretty explicit R-rated movies and a parent discovered it. So they told the church that he was taking a six-week sabbatical to help care of his sick mother but in fact it was due to that. He came back and he was escalating, and it was a policeman&#8211;. He took a kid after church to a park and was molesting him in a car and was found by a policeman, so we know that this all happened. I was in absolute shock, and I went to the pastors and I said, ""Why didn't you do something a year ago? This is bad behavior."" They denied that the meeting ever took place. They said, ""No, the kid didn't report this."" That's when I realized something was wrong. The mother was a friend of mine, I knew her through the school and stuff, and I watched her as she talked to me, and I knew when she was telling me the story, and I was watching her hands shake, that I knew my life was about to change forever. I knew that I was stepping into something that I couldn't come back from, but I didn't know quite what it was. I called a friend who taught Sunday school with us and I said, ""You're a deacon, you do something about it."" He goes, ""Well, I thought it was all dealt with."" I said, ""I'm sorry, you claim that you believe all this stuff in the Bible. You can't let this go."" He said that that was a moment that changed his life forever, that I held his feet to the fire. We got a group of people together and confronted the church. The church did an investigation and claimed that the meeting never took place and that they didn't know anything about it, and we knew that it had taken place. We had people who remember when it all occurred and so forth. We left the church, and the Bible study that we founded with our Sunday school class, the day we walked out &#8211; we told the class we had to leave and we were very frank about it &#8211; that class was decimated, and our friends all went to different churches but we still get together twice a month for a Bible study. We've been together for years, and the young man gave me a gift that I will never forget because I believed him. I was at a party and he came up to me and said, ""I got this for you,"" and it was those little Willow Creek&#8211;. Have you seen those little angel carvings? They're made of wood. You see them in the Hallmark stores. EF: Oh, yeah. DP: And it was the Angel of Courage, and her hands are raised like that, and he said, ""You gave up everything, your church, your Sunday school class, because you believed me."" And he is a very, very healthy young man today but he was headed down a tough path. So I said, ""That's it, I'm starting a blog. I'm going to start writing about a lot of things that have been troubling me for a long time,"" and my husband made me promise&#8211;. He said he wouldn't do it again, but my husband and my friend's husband were worried that we were going to get in trouble, we were going to get sued, and I can understand why they felt that way. So they asked us, in the incident that happened at that church, not to write about it directly, so we did a series called ""Leaving Wonderland"" and we wrote about what happened but gave names to the characters, like ""Alice"" and so forth. EF: Sure. DP: The church was mad at us, they actually got some lawyers, however Jeff Anderson, who is&#8211;. If you look him up on Wiki he's the one responsible for most of the settlements against the Catholic Church. He heard about what we did and he called me, he called and talked to me on the phone, and he said, ""I just want to let you know, they can throw you out of the church but they can't bring you to court. You've done nothing wrong. If you need me, I'll fly in and tell them."" So he then helped me to understand what I can say and what I can't say. EF: Sure. DP: So we began writing, we wrote about that. Then Mark Driscoll&#8211;. EF: And this is the Wartburg Watch, right? DP: Yes, and we named it after the castle that they had Martin Luther in when the pope was trying to&#8211;. EF: And what year did you begin this? DP: 2009. EF: Okay. DP: And nobody read us at first, except for people affiliated with the church who wanted to see if they could get any dirt. EF: Right. DP: We were very careful about what we said. But we also didn't like a lot of other people. Mark Driscoll was very famous, Mars Hill, and if you look at him, he just had to step down, but he was big. We wrote [about him and] we called it ""Brother Mark's Traveling Sex Show."" He came here to UNC campus and we wrote about&#8211;. I mean, he's pretty gruesome, and I don't&#8211;. It's almost hard to talk about some of the things he said as well, about women, as really&#8211;. Well, I mean everyone's written about it in the papers, in the New York Times. He called ""penis humps."" EF: Wow. DP: Yeah. I mean this was stuff that was going on, and we couldn't believe it because all of the Neo-Calvinist crowd, they were loving this Mark Driscoll who was into this manly stuff, and my friend and I, we're no one. We're just like average people. She has an MBA, by the way, from Carolina. We're average people and we're looking at everything we're seeing, and we talked to some pastors at Southeastern, seminarians, and they're saying, ""You don't get it. We all support them and there's something wrong with the two of you."" Well, Mark Driscoll just stepped down, so maybe we weren't so stupid after all. We're average nobodies. So I said, ""Look, let's get our thoughts out on the table. Let's start writing."" So the first year a few people trickled in. Well, we are still in absolute shock, because then people started sharing their stories. So we started posting their stories at this church and that church, and now, this morning, I had a little technical glitch and a guy in Perth, Australia said, ""I see your glitch. Here's how you take care of it."" I've got a guy in Perth, Australia, and there's even a gal who works during the summer months in Antarctica who follows us, and we have people in England and Scotland who are regulars on our blog, and we continue to go after child sex abuse. This was a big deal for us and there are so&#8211;. Boz Tchividjian, who is Billy Graham's grandson, he got into this too and he said that the evangelical church is in worse shape than the Catholic Church when it comes to child sex abuse, and he's formed a group called GRACE which is exposing child sex abuse in the evangelical church. And he's right, because if you look at the statistics you have like a billion adherents in the Catholic Church. If you look at it percentage wise we are higher than the Catholic Church when it comes to not handling child sex abuse, pedophilia, and so forth. EF: But Catholic abuses are much more in the media. DP: Yes, although it's starting, because we now are&#8211;. We were very involved in exposing the Sovereign Grace Ministries sex abuse cover-up, which we believe is a cover-up, and it is probably the biggest lawsuit that has been brought against one entity within the evangelical population. We were writing about that right from the start as well. A group of families have brought lawsuits against Sovereign Grace Ministries and it's going to be a long battle in the courts."

Then Mark Driscoll&#8211;. EF: And this is the Wartburg Watch, right? DP: Yes, and we named it after the castle that they had Martin Luther in when the pope was trying to&#8211;. EF: And what year did you begin this? DP: 2009. EF: Okay. DP: And nobody read us at first, except for people affiliated with the church who wanted to see if they could get any dirt. EF: Right. DP: We were very careful about what we said. But we also didn't like a lot of other people. Mark Driscoll was very famous, Mars Hill, and if you look at him, he just had to step down, but he was big. We wrote [about him and] we called it ""Brother Mark's Traveling Sex Show."" He came here to UNC campus and we wrote about&#8211;. I mean, he's pretty gruesome, and I don't&#8211;. It's almost hard to talk about some of the things he said as well, about women, as really&#8211;. Well, I mean everyone's written about it in the papers, in the New York Times. He called ""penis humps."" EF: Wow. DP: Yeah. I mean this was stuff that was going on, and we couldn't believe it because all of the Neo-Calvinist crowd, they were loving this Mark Driscoll who was into this manly stuff, and my friend and I, we're no one. We're just like average people. She has an MBA, by the way, from Carolina. We're average people and we're looking at everything we're seeing, and we talked to some pastors at Southeastern, seminarians, and they're saying, ""You don't get it. We all support them and there's something wrong with the two of you."" Well, Mark Driscoll just stepped down, so maybe we weren't so stupid after all. We're average nobodies. So I said, ""Look, let's get our thoughts out on the table. Let's start writing."" So the first year a few people trickled in. Well, we are still in absolute shock, because then people started sharing their stories. So we started posting their stories at this church and that church, and now, this morning, I had a little technical glitch and a guy in Perth, Australia said, ""I see your glitch. Here's how you take care of it."" I've got a guy in Perth, Australia, and there's even a gal who works during the summer months in Antarctica who follows us, and we have people in England and Scotland who are regulars on our blog, and we continue to go after child sex abuse. This was a big deal for us and there are so&#8211;. Boz Tchividjian, who is Billy Graham's grandson, he got into this too and he said that the evangelical church is in worse shape than the Catholic Church when it comes to child sex abuse, and he's formed a group called GRACE which is exposing child sex abuse in the evangelical church. And he's right, because if you look at the statistics you have like a billion adherents in the Catholic Church. If you look at it percentage wise we are higher than the Catholic Church when it comes to not handling child sex abuse, pedophilia, and so forth. EF: But Catholic abuses are much more in the media. DP: Yes, although it's starting, because we now are&#8211;. We were very involved in exposing the Sovereign Grace Ministries sex abuse cover-up, which we believe is a cover-up, and it is probably the biggest lawsuit that has been brought against one entity within the evangelical population. We were writing about that right from the start as well. A group of families have brought lawsuits against Sovereign Grace Ministries and it's going to be a long battle in the courts."

Domestic and sexual violence agencies do have a different approach than law enforcement. They have a different role. They are part of what I see is a community response, but their role is different. There are times when victims don't want an arrest to be made. They don't want to press charges. They don't want to come forward and tell their story, and for law enforcement it's important to hear from the victim because that helps them to make their case to make an arrest and possibly prosecute. CW: Yeah. MR: So yeah. So I do think, well I know their approaches are different, and at times they can be somewhat at odds in terms of what the victim really needs at the time or somewhere down the road.

As I said, my thesis advisor was an addict so he had no problem with me doing research on what he's addicted to, except he didn't say he was addicted but he kept his magazines in his drawer at the university. Okay. Anyway, so I did some experiments, which I didn't realize were experiments. I shouldn't have done them. We did EKGs. We had fourteen volunteers and we got a base run and they [gave] consent. Then we showed different images, and they were definitely resonating, but I thought at the time, like other people, that that would be okay. Well it wasn't okay, not that they complained, but it wasn't. We did a survey of a hundred and forty-seven women about what they thought, so the conflict was always there. They would always say, ""It doesn't bother me,"" basically, and then you ask them questions about their sense of self and the way men look at [them] and it was in complete contrast, complete contrast. So I'm thinking, ""Wow; this is really not good, not good."" So then, the way it led to child sex abuse, I was at my desk one day and I was going to deliver a paper &#8211; we had done a paper &#8211; on the effects of pornography on women, because that's what it was.

This is a child, and this is not a good picture."" Okay, it's a cartoon but it's not funny, and it's abuse. Well I thought, ""Okay, that's one. Will there be more?""

What is going on here? EF: And this is while you were in Cleveland? JR: [Pause] I don't remember. No. I don't remember. I can't figure it out. EF: That's okay. JR: Yeah, so I have that background. My daughter doesn't want me to talk to anybody but I get permission to tell my friend, Carol. I call my friend Carol and I tell her. She's in Berkeley. She's as Berkeley as you can get. I tell her, ""Carol, this is what happened to Jenny and I'm so upset,"" and she says, ""Judy, you don't understand. Children are sexual from birth. She probably kind of wanted this experience,"" and I said, ""No, she didn't. Thank you very much,"" and I hung up. Then I called my aunt in Maryland, matriarch kind of lady, couldn't be more different, and I tell her what happened and she says, ""Well, Judy, you have to understand, children are sexual from birth. She was probably a little interested,"" and so on. Now, I have been a communist-type and I know a party line when I hear a party line, and how you have a party line bridging those
kinds of areas, geographically and experientially and politically, there's still agreement, the same? She writes about it now, Linda Bartlett. EF: Right. JR: It's wonderful. EF: So, if I can ask, how did your daughter deal with that terrible experience and how did you, as a parent and as a researcher, also put it all together? JR: Well for a year, she didn't deal with it well because we didn't know. I didn't know. Once she said what happened, and in those years we didn't know to call it rape, so I said, ""Well you were seduced. You were seduced."" She said he had her shoes and she couldn't go. It didn't matter to her, I suppose. It's okay, the words. I said, ""It wasn't your fault,"" and so on. EF: Sure. JR: And I couldn't do anything about him because the woman had sent him back to England. They apparently knew. They heard from the other kids so they got rid of the kid. So then, it took a little while, but she was okay after she told me and we told her father &#8211; I got permission &#8211; and he handled it okay: ""It's not your fault,"" and so on."	"JR: First it was just pornography, because I didn't know the connection with child abuse. So at first &#8211; I'm going to get a copy of this? EF: Mm hmm. JR: At first, after that experience, I started doing work in the area of pornography. As I said, my thesis advisor was an addict so he had no problem with me doing research on what he's addicted to, except he didn't say he was addicted but he kept his magazines in his drawer at the university. Okay. Anyway, so I did some experiments, which I didn't realize were experiments. I shouldn't have done them. We did EKGs. We had fourteen volunteers and we got a base run and they [gave] consent. Then we showed different images, and they were definitely resonating, but I thought at the time, like other people, that that would be okay. Well it wasn't okay, not that they complained, but it wasn't. We did a survey of a hundred and forty-seven women about what they thought, so the conflict was always there. They would always say, ""It doesn't bother me,"" basically, and then you ask them questions about their sense of self and the way men look at [them] and it was in complete contrast, complete contrast. So I'm thinking, ""Wow; this is really not good, not good."" So then, the way it led to child sex abuse, I was at my desk one day and I was going to deliver a paper &#8211; we had done a paper &#8211; on the effects of pornography on women, because that's what it was. So I got a hold of this engineering guy &#8211; he was addicted too &#8211; and I asked him, I said, ""Can I have some of your Playboys? He said, ""What do you want them for?"" So I said, ""I'm just going to look at them. I just want to go through them."" He said, ""Well, which ones?"" because he couldn't let go of certain ones, even for&#8211;. [Laughs] He couldn't tell how long I was going to need them. So anyway, I got his stack and I started going through them. Well, anyway, I started going through them and flipping them, and I thought, ""Did I see a kid? Did I? No."" Then I go back and, ""Yeah; that's a kid. This is a child, and this is not a good picture."" Okay, it's a cartoon but it's not funny, and it's abuse. Well I thought, ""Okay, that's one. Will there be more?"" So I'm flipping and there's another one, and I'm flipping, and another one. So then I went back and started to look at the totality of the magazine and realized that Playmate has &#8211; are children they have the little pictures of children, and I&#8211;. Whoa! This is not good. There's going to be child sexual abuse here. This is not innocent. Then my daughter was raped by the boy upstairs, who was thirteen, at which point I realized later that laws had been changed to accommodate the fact that [if] a boy of thirteen abuses a girl of ten there's a little peer exception rule so that they can rape kids. What is this about? So all this starts to add up, and my daughter, her reaction to this rape &#8211; it was over a year until I found out &#8211; was indicative of&#8211;. And the boy had stacks of Playboy. His father collected Playboy and they were up in his closet, stacks of it, but I'd never connected all these things. I mean I knew because I knew the mother and she mentioned it, and I thought at the time, ""That's silly. What man looks at that? My goodness!"" But I never thought more than that about it. So then the connection is made between Playboy and the rapes, and it turns out that my daughter wasn't the only one. It was the neighbor children, boys and girls. This kid was molesting them, and he was getting therapy, so the therapist wasn't permitted to tell any of the neighbors or anybody, warn anybody that we had a predator in our midst, because there's [doctor-patient] privilege.

She's very popular and she wrote an article in the Yale Law Review on rape and she said, ""What has happened to the rape laws?"" She said, ""With the conservatives we had tougher penalties for rape than we have with the liberals,"" and she's very liberal. She said the America Law Institute Model Penal Code&#8211;.

What science on rape? What science on child abuse? What science on divorce? What science on sodomy? The Model Penal Code from 1955, and who do they cite in the Model Penal Code a hundred percent on sodomy and on rape? The Kinsey Institute, Alfred Kinsey. So, in 1948 half the states in the union had a penalty of death for rape &#8211; did you know that? &#8211; simple rape, not cutting off the arms, not a little kid, just a regular male-female kind of rape, the old fashioned kind. You know that's changed. The kind of rape we deal with now has changed. It's radically changed. But anyway, so, rape. Half the states offered the death penalty, the other half, life. You could get life for rape, and one of them you could get forty years. Okay. What does that tell you about the attitude, the relationship between women and men at that time? You believe the woman who said she was raped because virginity was a prized property of hers. She wouldn't say she was raped and risk the fact that she was no longer a virgin. Kinsey came along and said: these women are all lying. They're really promiscuous. They &#8211; fornication was against the law &#8211; they have engaged in fornication. But there's no downside to anything. There was never a downside. He didn't have a downside. He didn't have abortion. He didn't have venereal disease.

And this is the most quoted science in the world on sex? This is the science that we base sex education on, and this is the science that churches say children are sexual from birth based on? EF: So you produced some of your findings, and how was it received in the academic community over the 1970s and 1980s? JR: Well first, before I did that, I was supposed to research Kinsey and Playboy. The Department of Justice&#8211;. EF: Right. JR: Yeah. I was principal investigator. EF: At American University, or it was funded through there? JR: Yeah, American University. EF: This was in 1984, somewhere in that&#8211;? JR: Yeah. The trouble was the president was a pedophile. The trouble was&#8211;. EF: The president of American University? JR: Of American University, yeah, was a pedophile. The trouble was the head of the psych department was apparently a pedophile too. He was supposed to have [had] sex with a little nine-year-old girl in his trailer park at a nudist colony, Elliott McGinnies, so I had a lot of trouble at the university getting my research approved and so on. I don't know how many others because birds of a feather flock together. You try to make sure that nobody's going to squeal on you, that you have around you the right people, because otherwise somebody may tell. Somebody may report you or something. So I was supposed to do the research on Kinsey at American University. The Department of Justice &#8211; this was under Reagan, the last great chance anybody ever had to do any research &#8211; so then my grant hit all kinds of trouble. Well, I did know, but it turns out Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, they were all lobbying American University. They were going crazy because they thought I would find what I found. So they were threatening them, and the Kinsey Institute was threatening them, and I was sitting there in my office, trying to do my study. So then the Kinsey Institute threatened to sue them if American University let me do what I was going to do, so they cut out academic freedom, thank you very much. So they cut out any ability of me to research Kinsey's work, which was ridiculous because I wasn't experimenting. He was, but I wasn't. I was going to look at the documents and try and find out where the children came from, because we had a lot of leads at that time. He'd gone into the orphanages and into the homes of the colored children &#8211; in those years &#8211; and so we were checking those out, but they cut our throats. They said, ""No way. You're not going to do that research."" EF: So American didn't allow it? JR: Mm hmm. EF: They didn't publish it? JR: No. They didn't allow me to do the research. EF: Oh, I see. JR: The academic committee of respectable academics was the one that said, ""No, you can't do that. You can't."" So, okay, but they let me do the Playboy stuff. EF: Okay. JR: You can look at Playboy. So I figured well; if that's all we can do that's all we can do. So we did the research on Playboy and found that they had been sexualizing children from 1954 and had engaged in what is now known as child pornography regularly. That seems important. The public needs to know that. Grandpa and Father weren't looking at innocuous stuff. He thought he was looking at innocuous things but they weren't innocuous because the way they work on the brain leaves no doubt that they work on the brain. They're what we call ""flashbulb memories,"" that is everyone remembers that first nude that they saw, everyone, and they remember, in those days, because it's not like now on the iPads and everything else, and they remember where they were and who they were with when they saw that sexy image. They remember everything and they remember the cartoons. They remember all the cartoons. How do I know that? Because of a lot of research I've done since, but the fellow who told me about Kinsey, who said go look at Kinsey? When I saw him earlier I said, ""There are kids in Playboy,"" and he said, ""No, there aren't,"" and I said, ""Yeah, there are,"" and he said, ""No, there aren't."" He's a psychologist and he knows. [I said,] ""So you know Playboy?"" and he said, ""Well, yeah, I've seen it, and there aren't."" EF: How were you defining&#8211;? What constituted ""children?"" JR: Under eighteen. EF: Okay. JR: Under eighteen. EF: Did you do research to find out who&#8211;? Like some of them were cartoons, but for those that were photos did you look into who they were? JR: Yep.

I read what he wrote, what he said, and it's there. It's in his two books. Chapter five shows a two-month-old baby being masturbated, or digitally manipulated &#8211; or maybe penetrated, because later on one of his colleagues said that they did involve penetration &#8211; for a certain amount of time in order to get an orgasm. Then he has a three-month-old, four-month-old, five-month-old, six-month-old, and he lists these little children, and that's torture. That's what they were doing to the little babies. Tables 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and what he called&#8211;. Then I looked. I said, okay. Alright. Okay, so these are what he said, that they did over &#8211; and the timing, how long it took to get the orgasm, and the time in between orgasms of the kids, and I said okay; what did he call an orgasm? I thought sure the guy would have not described it, but he did. Page 160 and 161. He said that there were one hundred and ninety-six children and he broke them up into six categories, six types &#8211; that's what he called it, six types &#8211; one, two, three, four, five, six. That made it very scientific. It's got numbers and everything, you see? Then he said that the children screamed, they cried, hysterical tears, and he put in parentheses, ""Especially among the younger children."" What? What? Then he said, ""And some strike the partner."" That's the man who was raping them. Excuse me. ""Strike the partner and try and get away."" Yeah? ""But,"" he said, ""they definitely enjoy the experience because they often return to&#8211;,"" and I thought, ""Holy smokes! This is got to be a sadomasochistic&#8211;."" Do you want to see the charts and all that? EF: Perhaps after the interview. JR: I said, ""He has got to be a sadomasochistic pedophile."" I mean, that's what he's got to be. There's no human being who could describe babies writhing in pain and say that they enjoyed that as an orgasm but a sadomasochistic pedophile, so that means he was a pedophile. And this is the most quoted science in the world on sex? This is the science that we base sex education on, and this is the science that churches say children are sexual from birth based on? EF: So you produced some of your findings, and how was it received in the academic community over the 1970s and 1980s? JR: Well first, before I did that, I was supposed to research Kinsey and Playboy. The Department of Justice&#8211;. EF: Right. JR: Yeah. I was principal investigator. EF: At American University, or it was funded through there? JR: Yeah, American University. EF: This was in 1984, somewhere in that&#8211;? JR: Yeah. The trouble was the president was a pedophile. The trouble was&#8211;. EF: The president of American University? JR: Of American University, yeah, was a pedophile. The trouble was the head of the psych department was apparently a pedophile too. He was supposed to have [had] sex with a little nine-year-old girl in his trailer park at a nudist colony, Elliott McGinnies, so I had a lot of trouble at the university getting my research approved and so on. I don't know how many others because birds of a feather flock together. You try to make sure that nobody's going to squeal on you, that you have around you the right people, because otherwise somebody may tell. Somebody may report you or something. So I was supposed to do the research on Kinsey at American University. The Department of Justice &#8211; this was under Reagan, the last great chance anybody ever had to do any research &#8211; so then my grant hit all kinds of trouble. Well, I did know, but it turns out Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, they were all lobbying American University. They were going crazy because they thought I would find what I found. So they were threatening them, and the Kinsey Institute was threatening them, and I was sitting there in my office, trying to do my study. So then the Kinsey Institute threatened to sue them if American University let me do what I was going to do, so they cut out academic freedom, thank you very much.

I knew that a group of people at the conference were pedophiles, or just deviants and perverts, because they were on the Penthouse ""Forum."" So it's complicated. All the academicians there at this conference, except me, said that Tom O'Carroll, freedom of speech, he should come and he should speak about pedophilia as a viable exchange, and I said, ""Heck no. [We were in Wales.] We're guests of the people and we have no right to bring in a pedophile who advocates raping their kids, and then we leave and they're left with that talk from an academic institution? No. Never."" So I was the only one who said that. Everybody else thought it was a freedom of speech, right, which says a lot about our academic sensibility, in my opinion.

So that's how the connection came between &#8211; and Kinsey was the man who said, ""Children are sexual from birth."" Nobody had said that before him, and Playboy drew it in their cartoon. So the picture echoed the position of Kinsey, and that's been disastrous for children. It's been disastrous. Children are spiritual from birth. There's nothing biblical that says that they're sexual. There's nothing that defines children as sexual at all, and skipping past biblically, if we're talking anatomically and biologically, no. That's not true. The churches have accepted it, a lot of them: we have to have sex education because children are sexual. What? There isn't the slightest reason to believe that. They're sexualized.

Even if the mom's use had nothing to do with why the baby was in the NICU. Well, I mean, they could say, you know, very clearly how angry they were at these women, and that it would translate into behaviors, like not welcoming her home when she came in. You know, like another woman, she might say, 'Oh, Mary, come over and see what Frankie's doing today. And I want to show you this.' They wouldn't necessarily do that, because they would assume she didn't care, she shouldn't have done what she did. It was a very punitive response, which we all understand because we all have some of those feelings, but when we're professionals, you need to be aware of those feelings, and then make sure that you're doing what your role is, which is to help this woman take a different road. Or they wouldn't give her information, or necessarily share things with her that they would with a woman who was not using and a mother of her infant in the NICU. So, we know that people really need to look at some of their attitudes. And, and when you ask anyone, 'How do you feel about let's say a eight-month-old pregnant woman, you know, smoking? You know, how do you feel?' We want people to talk about how they feel and what are their--what are they thinking when they see that. And, and, they become more aware of, 'Wow, they say she's stupid, where she's been, how ignorant can you be?' Or, you know, 'I can't have a baby and here she gets to have a baby, and she can't even, you know, take care of this baby.' That, that those are normal things that, in our culture, brought up in our culture, that we're going to feel and think. But then we have to go beyond that if we're going to be helpers for someone who's making some changes in this area, to how we can be helpful to her, and to understand what's going on with her that that's what she's doing. Now of course, as it turns out, and this is how the circle goes around, one of the primary issues for women in substance addictions is trauma. You know, they have been child sexual abuse survivors, rape victims, battering victims, and that's a major way that women cope with trauma, and learn how to manage, PTSD symptoms is to, to zone out, you know, to numb out. And that's a major piece of what's going on for many of the women that we work with. So, I mean it was like really, for me, a circle coming around.	CR: Mm-kay. I think, probably--you know I certainly was very aware of stigma with battered women. The tremendous blame that they received just because they were battered women. Well, the stigma and the discrimination against women who use substances is, is terrible. As bad, or worse, where there is this great condemnation of her, and how she's hurting her child, how she's deserving of the bad things that happen to her because she shouldn't be drinking. I mean, and there's a long history, of course, showing, you know--when you see a woman drinking on the street, and, you know not in control of herself--of saying, you know, 'She deserves what she gets,' or 'She must be a prostitute,' or whatever it is. And then, of course when it involves an infant or a fetus, there's this even greater condemnation, because motherhood is to be this sacred thing that only the worst women would, you know, not do as they should. So, I think that is the stigma that is really, really one we continue to fight again, and again, and again. So, part of our role was, has been, to outreach to all the people who might provide to her, and talk with them about what addiction is about what addiction is about for women. I mean, how they get involved in it, what keeps them in it, what are the things that prevent them from recovering, so that they have a much more empathetic understanding of what this is about. So that they're not, they're more willing to, give her a hand like they would someone else with a major problem, and--as opposed to judging her. And I can give you an example. We used to go to nurseries up in the hospitals, unnamed hospitals, and ask, you know, nurses, let's say in the NICUs that--you know how did they feel about our patients, and women who had used and their babies were now in the NICU. Even if the mom's use had nothing to do with why the baby was in the NICU.

If they see their parents or people in their community deal with life and life's problems by drinking, then, you know, like other behaviors, you know, that's what they may decide to do, too. And, in fact, see it as normal, fine, okay, as long as you don't do certain things. And then, though, if they become hooked, then really addicted to it, then they've got major problems. So it may be the learned behavior. And we can see that everywhere. When someone dies, someone says, 'Oh, give her a Valium, you know, so she can sleep tonight.' Or, 'she needs a stiff drink,' so she can manage those feelings. I mean, it's a very common thing for us to do is to take a pill or a drug or alcohol as a way of dealing with an emotion that's uncomfortable or painful. And, so there's that culturally going on, and then if it's happening in your homes, behaviorally, you see it and you have access to it, then you're likely to use that as a way. Now, and you'll see this with our women who have been sexually abused as children, when you ask them at what age they started taking alcohol or a drug, and you know, six, eight, ten. You know, what's going on that a child would be doing that at that age? What's happening in that family that they have, one, access to it, but that that is seen as something's going on that they need that. So, a large part of it is that it's how our society tends to cope with things, is through taking pills. And you know pills, now, is the major addiction we're dealing with.

Or for whatever it was that he wanted her to do that for, but it was a case that set the standard that you could be found guilty of sexual harassment and damages could be rewarded for psychological damages. Because at one time, the psychological damages were not a part of the remedies for a sexual harassment discrimination lawsuit. So now, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent emotional infliction of emotional distress, and whatever traumas you experience due to the sexual harassments you experienced on the job, is actionable and recoverable."

But at the same time I really admired the working class consciousness that the white women had. I mean the way we all got jobs at the D.C.

I mean they were not wealthy women. One was a carpenter, one was a telephone operator.

My mother said, ""Oh, he was one of Big Mama's children,"" and that's all she said about Uncle Eli, and nobody went to his funeral or anything. So Uncle Eli was like the big mystery but we weren't curious enough to try to follow it up. Well it turns out Uncle Eli was the uncle that sexually abused all the girls in the family. So Mama never had a healthy relationship around sex and sexuality, and then when I became pregnant through incest, through a cousin, my mother went ballistic. She actually beat me for being pregnant. She was not healthy around sex and sexuality. I could never under"". And she did some really predictable but what seemed to be bizarre things at the time, like every time my father would take one of his daughters out""and me and my father were particularly close so I hung out with Daddy all the time. I was Daddy's girl. Daddy was the light of my life and I loved him to death. I know I was his favorite child and he knows he was my favorite parent, so there was no ambiguity at all about our relationship, but my mother would get so angry. I knew the minute I came home whatever I did it was not going to be right, and they believed in corporal punishment, so if I didn't wash the dishes good enough that night I was going to get a whipping. It wasn't until years later that I put together her fear around an adult male having a child outside of her eyes. My big sister told me, ""She did the same with me.""

She had blamed herself for her own so she blamed me for mine. We actually agreed that I would go to a home for unwed mothers. CGD: How old were you? LR: Fourteen. CGD: Okay.

But I met a family there and the man was being abusive to his three-year-old daughter, and I am sure it was clear on my face that I didn't approve. She had hit him, and he had hit her, and then she had hit him. But he was hitting her until she had red splotches all over, and he had been drinking, and I could tell the mother was really upset. We were in a very remote picnic area. It was getting dark and the man offered to go up and let me look down and see if I could see my compatriots, and if I didn't I was going to go back into - I was up near Cookville, Tennessee. Anyway, without the gory details, he ended up beating me up and raping me, and I was twenty one at the time. But the thing that has ended up about that experience is that I had never had a violent experience before, never been in a violent situation. My parents were very gentle people. Most of the people I knew were gentle people, so I had never come up against violence in that way. But what he kept saying-and he was almost in a trance-what he kept saying over and over again is that ""I have killed women and children in Vietnam and I can crack your neck with one hand."" He just kept saying that over and over about Vietnam. He was a Vietnam vet. Later I commented to someone, they said, ""Who raped you?"" And I said, ""The war.""

I actually ended up knowing who he was because his wife had given me his business card, because she liked my dog, and she had no idea. I think she must have sensed that something happened, because I took him back and I was all beaten up, and I just let him out of the car and drove off. He had no idea that I had his business card in my pocket. I just could not do that to my parents. They would have never gotten a night's rest about me. It was hard enough for them for me to be on my own. But that is what has haunted me about that period of time.

I think that really helped put us in the public arena to get people thinking and talking, and people who might not actually want to be seen with us identifying with us privately and quietly, and that can reflect itself in the ballot box or sometimes in a checkbook. I think those issues did help, people could identify with those. We've made a lot of progress in terms of raising public awareness on those issues and made some law changes but the underlying problem still exists and I see it all the time in my practice. I practice a lot of domestic law and violence and people quietly hiding their secret of violence in their home goes on every day still. It's very difficult to root that out, and that may be fundamentally a disrespect issue and you disrespect the people who aren't equal. If they're not as good as you and they're not entitled to the same opportunity then they're somehow a subspecies.	Domestic violence was still then a very private matter, sure, yeah. I think that really helped put us in the public arena to get people thinking and talking, and people who might not actually want to be seen with us identifying with us privately and quietly, and that can reflect itself in the ballot box or sometimes in a checkbook. I think those issues did help, people could identify with those. We've made a lot of progress in terms of raising public awareness on those issues and made some law changes but the underlying problem still exists and I see it all the time in my practice. I practice a lot of domestic law and violence and people quietly hiding their secret of violence in their home goes on every day still. It's very difficult to root that out, and that may be fundamentally a disrespect issue and you disrespect the people who aren't equal. If they're not as good as you and they're not entitled to the same opportunity then they're somehow a subspecies.

1837	Coleman, Carolyn	WOL	1952	1950	OK	White	Some college			2007.0	55	I finally did. I started out with skirts and blazers and that type of thing. I think about the ladies and they d dress all over the board sometimes. There are a few ladies who never wore anything but suits, and some are a little bit more casual. I won t tell you her name, but there was a representative who was elected, and she came up there and would wear a blazer, but she would wear these horribly, horribly derogatory t-shirts. They were derogatory against men. They were horrible, and she would come over to us and give us these cartoons that she had copied off 18 Finchum Coleman somewhere. They were horrible, and she would give those to us and say, These are just for us girls. And I m just thinking, Oh my gosh, and I m so dumb I never shared it with any of the guys. After the first year or the first legislative session, she learned because after that she started dressing very professionally. There are a few other people that noticed that, but it was very, very inappropriate. She finally started dressing very professionally and I realized, I need some suits. I ve been told the chamber is always cold. Oh, it s freezing and I would gripe like crazy about those fans and everything, trying to get them to turn the fans down, turn the heat up. In fact, I can even remember I don t know why I keep remembering Kevin Cox, but he went out to his car one time and got a blanket. It was horribly cold, and I guess it s to keep you awake some of the time. One thing I would like to say, just for posterity I guess it was difficult being a woman. It s difficult being a republican woman in the minority. One thing people need to understand is there were some guys out there that were horrible male chauvinists. I knew not to ever get near them and there was one guy I should have filed a sexual harassment suit against once because of his off-color teasing. I knew who I could tease with and who I couldn t, you know. I knew who I could come up and pat on the back and who I couldn t. But women are no different. I m not going to say names, but there was one legislator, she was young and to get what she wanted, she would go to the back of the chamber and hop up on the desk. She wore these real cute little short skirts and she knew what she was doing. She used her sexuality, you know. The men go about it a different way, but the women use their sexuality. I saw this particular representative several times embraced with men. I called it bear hugged, and she knew what she was doing. I thought, You don t need to do that. Then this other representative, she would file all these bills and we d kill them. Then she d come over to the guys and start rubbing her hands all over their backs and saying, If you d just let me bring the bill up for reconsideration if you ll just vote if you ll just give in to my let me bring it back up, and I ll take it back to committee, and she d just rub all over them, and of course they did it. She never did come up with decent bills, I didn t think. I d sit there and watch this going on, and I d go over and I d say, You are so pathetic you are so pathetic that you let her come over here and do this. She managed to get her stuff through. Most of the other women I don t think really did that. There s always a little bit of that feminine thing because we re women and we deal with things differently, but I remember those two. 19 Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman And then there are always rumors but it was difficult being a woman out there because you weren t in the in-group. Like I said at the beginning, I had to go and search out information because they weren t going to give it to me voluntarily. I think that s probably true of most of the women. We had to really fight. But for all those guys that were just horrible, there were some really good guys. I just thought the world of them and they understood that we were all equal out there. Since this is about women I think people need to know, that it goes both ways.	I finally did. I started out with skirts and blazers and that type of thing.

Now that was kind of a gender based issue. We had a little sexual harassment going on down there with our county commissioner and a lot of people really felt that a woman would be the answer. So when I found about twenty women asked me to run county employees I did choose to run and I did win. I was very surprised again. That was a hot and heavy race too. Although this area was pretty much evenly split, at least registration-wise. But there were two male candidates and I in the primary and there were four male candidates on the other side the democrat side.

1851	Hamilton, Rebecca	WOL	1948	1940	OK	White	High school graduate			2008.0	60	Well, I was the original author of the Protective Order here in Oklahoma. It took me two years to pass that back in the day and the major reason why is because it took me that long to get the chips to pass it. That was a big coup because that was just unthinkable to pass that here. That, I guess, and my first I also got this capacity hotline for rape victims here in Oklahoma. I got the funding it wasn t a piece of legislation, but I got the funding to set up the first statewide it was five pilot programs around the state for adult daycare. Okay. And I was one of the people who worked on nursing home reform, and back then nursing homes really, really, really needed reforming. Then when I came back, I ve done a lot of things in my second go-around that I m really proud of, too. Can you tell us about those? Well, I remarked earlier that I was pro-choice in my first time in office. Well then I had a very powerful religious conversion, and when I came back I was pro-life which has been the source of a great deal of controversy surrounding me. As part of that process, I was the primary author of the House Bill 1686 in 2005. That was the bill that broke the log jam. There was a 30-year log jam on pro-life legislation, and getting that through changed that. Now a big part of that change was the republican takeover of the House. It changed the climate quite a bit, too but it took all of us. I think that s something that people don t realize. We desperately need both parties to be working together on things that matter and not trying to shoot each other down all the time. That s terrible for the people, terrible for the country. I passed that. Let s see I passed a bill saying that you couldn t put rape victims private information on the Internet, which I thought was very important. I passed another pro-life bill, and both of these bills required informed consent before abortion. They required parental consent for minors. The first bill said that if you murder a pregnant woman you can be charged with the death of the baby as well as the death of the woman. Then the second bill basically dealt with funding and some of those issues. I passed that. There again, that was actually Representative John Wright s 11 Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton bill, but in order to get it through I had to author it at the final thing, and that s an example of both parties working together. I really don t know that I passed that bill. I stepped in when I needed to step in to get it through. I passed a bill this year making it a crime to beat up a pregnant woman, which only took me five years.	Well, I was the original author of the Protective Order here in Oklahoma. It took me two years to pass that back in the day and the major reason why is because it took me that long to get the chips to pass it. That was a big coup because that was just unthinkable to pass that here. That, I guess, and my first I also got this capacity hotline for rape victims here in Oklahoma. I got the funding it wasn t a piece of legislation, but I got the funding to set up the first statewide it was five pilot programs around the state for adult daycare. Okay. And I was one of the people who worked on nursing home reform, and back then nursing homes really, really, really needed reforming. Then when I came back, I ve done a lot of things in my second go-around that I m really proud of, too. Can you tell us about those? Well, I remarked earlier that I was pro-choice in my first time in office. Well then I had a very powerful religious conversion, and when I came back I was pro-life which has been the source of a great deal of controversy surrounding me. As part of that process, I was the primary author of the House Bill 1686 in 2005. That was the bill that broke the log jam. There was a 30-year log jam on pro-life legislation, and getting that through changed that. Now a big part of that change was the republican takeover of the House. It changed the climate quite a bit, too but it took all of us. I think that s something that people don t realize. We desperately need both parties to be working together on things that matter and not trying to shoot each other down all the time. That s terrible for the people, terrible for the country. I passed that. Let s see I passed a bill saying that you couldn t put rape victims private information on the Internet, which I thought was very important. I passed another pro-life bill, and both of these bills required informed consent before abortion. They required parental consent for minors. The first bill said that if you murder a pregnant woman you can be charged with the death of the baby as well as the death of the woman. Then the second bill basically dealt with funding and some of those issues. I passed that.

Of course, when I first came up here my first goal was to finish some things that my husband wanted to finish his last term. He had just gotten reelected in 2002 before he became ill. And so one of the programs that took me two sessions to complete was the graduated driver s license for teenagers. He had worked on that for a couple of years so I worked on that pretty hard and we got that done. The other one is a trucking bill that he had and this is one I had a hard time following. (Laughs) So I at least got some other senators involved in it and we were able to get that done. It was to help get kind of a one-stop shop for truckers to get licenses and other things in one agency instead of spread out over two or three, which was just costly and time consuming. So they did get that done. Another group did that. A couple that I haven t finished yet, is on driver s license programs in public schools. We had them for years and now we ve quit having them, then they started coming back and then they re gone again. And that s because of the money and the driver s license education fund. I m going to try to work on that again this year because it s a reimbursement program. If schools don t get reimbursed sufficiently, they re not going to carry the program, pure and simple. So I m going to look at that. Another one that I ve started that Keith did work on some was trying to create a aging department to consolidate all of senior s services because right now they re spread out over six or seven agencies. That just doesn t make any sense to me. This is something very high on senior groups lists your area-wide aging, your silver-haired legislature and other senior groups, AARP, this is pretty high on their list. And so I ve had that bill up there for a couple of years and I m still working on it. I think we re going to see a little movement on it this year, I really do. We ve got some additional groups involved and interested and some more legislators interested in it too. Another one is domestic violence. I ve got a real passion for domestic violence as far as trying to do something about it in Oklahoma. It just gets me that it s still a misdemeanor for a first-time offense. And if anyone knows anything about domestic violence, you know it s happened more than once before it ever gets to court, before there are 20 Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich ever charges filed. It is a violent crime, first and foremost and yet we are not making that first-offense a felony. But yet we re filling up our prisons with all these non-violent offenders. I have a real problem with that. One of the scenarios I use is in Oklahom
 it s a felony to own a fighting rooster or fight dogs but it s a misdemeanor to hit your wife. I am hoping in the time I m here, that Oklahoma is going to stand up and say, Enough is enough. That We re not having any tolerance for domestic violence. And help me push that through the legislature and get that done. In addition to that, it s important to also give some economic security to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. That s another bill that I ve been working on."

Having been a single mother for a while, without an education, I probably always and having had a heart for the under-served in our community and the disabled and disenfranchised, I suspect I was always a democrat and didn t know it. But when it came time to register, I always I ve never voted straight-ticket. So I would always look at the people and learn as much as I could. But, I actually became involved in politics when in 1981 I went to work for a young woman at the time named Susan Savage. And Susan and I ran the Crime Commission. It was a non-profit which dealt with crime prevention and community safety. We chugged along as any non-profit does, making it month to month, raising money and serving the community. It gave me the opportunity to visit homes all over Tulsa. And most of these people were victims of crimes.

1858	Peterson, Pam	WOL	1955	1950	NY	White	Bachelor's degree			2008.0	53	And I chaired last year the task force to stop sexual violence. And then out of the task force you usually come up with bills to present? Yes, and last year we came up with a bill that actually passed and is current law, which I m real pleased with, dealing with the CLEET Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training hours, the CLEET training hours, the police hours. What we found in the course of the task force was that police officers were not sufficiently trained in rape and sexual violence cases, and many times felt a little insecure going to those kinds of when they had to be called in to go to those 12 Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum reports. And so we thought, Wow, we can certainly improve that system by increasing the CLEET hours for sexual violence training. So we ve got, I believe, six hours now in addition to the CLEET hours that we have for all police officers in the state. I think that s a positive change	. Well, my first committee assignment was as chairman of the CareerTech Committee. That was a great experience because I learned a lot about that system and what a jewel it is in Oklahoma and how it s recognized worldwide. We have subcommittees now under the new leadership and regular committees, so CareerTech has been incorporated into the Higher Ed Committee and currently I serve on that committee. I chair the subcommittee on Children and Families. I also serve on Human Services and serve on the subcommittee on Criminal Justice. And I chaired last year the task force to stop sexual violence.

There s some ongoing things that we re looking at that we weren t able to implement right away, but as you know, it takes years to make changes. It s a process. It s a process, yes, and I think it s important to keep that perspective.

1860	Weedn, Trish	WOL	1950	1950	OK	White	Bachelor's degree			2007.0	57	What is very passionate to me and very important to me was partial birth abortion, to stop that. I was the author and it passed. In Oklahoma, there could not be any partial birth abortions performed. Being a democrat woman was very controversial, received a lot of phone calls and a lot of letters about how disappointed they were that I was a woman, number one, and that I was a democrat. But again that was my heart, it was my passion, and I am pro-life. I m very open to the life and death of the mother and incest and rape but as far as just for birth control, I don t agree with that. That s where I stand. Everyone knew where I stood, and that was another issue that was very controversial at the time	Well, I guess the first very emotional, controversial hard decision that I voted on was the House Bill 1750. That was the education bill, where they increased taxes to fund education, a very, very controversial bill and just barely passed. And Governor Bellmon was in. I was so pro-education and I wanted to do whatever it took to get the best possible education for our children in the state and I knew that we had to do something. But you had to think at the time that if you voted for a tax increase then you probably wouldn t be back. That was the decision that I had to make. I felt like whether I came back or not, it was the right decision, and that was the most controversial bill.

We had a total it was our all-time high a total of five women legislators in the House from Tulsa. Alene Baker and Twyla Mason and I were the three new ones. All Tulsa area House members , except for Joan Hastings, supported the Equal Rights Amendment. At any rate, there we were, we women, sitting in this committee on the judiciary. We actually were on the subcommittee of juvenile justice. That was my interest, policy for young people, but we were part of this larger committee of the judiciary. A legislator by the name of Frank Shurden had this bill he became known as the legislator who was for castration for those who had committed rape. At this point, he had the bill that called for alternate death sentences for criminals, convicted criminals. They could choose 12 how they were going to die, how they would be put to death. I kept listening to this bill and these other women on the committee, these big Equal Rights Amendment supporters, who were saying, Oh, yeah. Great. That s just so American, you know, freedom of choice. I was thinking, What is wrong with this picture? So I finally got up my nerve and asked my first question, and that was, How would you write the job description for the executioner? I mean, we re talking about people. One of the lines of the bill was, You may choose to die in the way you did in your victim. It was kind of screw-y language, and then everybody started looking at the language and so, finally, we defeated the bill, the alternate death penalty bill. But it was just a strange bill. So then I found out that I really could ask a question and that questions can sometimes lead to the right outcome if you just find the right question.
