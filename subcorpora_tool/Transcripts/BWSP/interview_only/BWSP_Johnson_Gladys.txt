Barbara J. Anton: This is Barbara Anton. I am in Worcester, MA, at the home of
Gladys Paine Johnson, Class of 1913. I want to also add for anyone who may be
doing research, maybe interested in the, learning about what it was like at Brown
when Mrs. Johnson was in school, that she has written an autobiography, entitled
Gad: Nine Decades of Happy Living; and, I'll let her explain the title. This book is
a permanent part of the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archives in the John Hay
Library and is available for use. Okay, Mrs. Johnson, let's get started with a little
bit about your family background, something about your parents and your siblings
and so forth.
Gladys Paine Johnson: Well, I think you would say that I am a WASP because on
both sides of my family, it goes back fairly far, the Paine generation was started in
1630, when a widower and his twelve year old son came to the Boston area to start
a new life and, incidentally, find a new wife. And, on my mother's side, the
genealogy can be traced back to the Revolutionary War. There is one little thing
that is said, but I can't prove it, that on my paternal, my paternal grandfather's side,
he had a little Indian blood in him. I can't prove it, but I think that is a delightful
thing to think, maybe, there is a little Indian, original American in me. Uh, I think
that's enough about the ancestors - my father and mother had seven children and I
was the only one who had a college education.
BJA: Now, that interested me - why was that? How did it happen that only you
went to college?
GPJ: Well, the farm boys came first. And, like all boys, they got into mischief,
and, my father was very strict. So, it related, it resulted in my mother sending the
oldest boy down South to school at a missionary settlement. And, I can remember
the third boy climbing out of the window to get away and falling off the roof of the
porch and breaking his collar bone.
BJA: Oh, my goodness!
GPJ : So, they were not, they had good minds, but they had so much restriction
that they wanted to go on their own. And, of course, there was the problem of
money. And, then, the two girls younger than I, one was a very good vocalist and
she had a professional training in music. And, she did professional work on the
stage in ?, and then later became a teacher of music in the public schools. The
youngest child was very much handicapped by illness; and, so it was just that I
liked to study and I liked to do well in school, and my mother was very ambitious
and without much of any financial background - I don't know how she ever got me
through college. There was one help from a principal of the school, grammar
school that I went to, was a Brown graduate. And, he was responsible for my
getting a scholarship, which I kept all fOl.fr years while I was there. So, it was
because it came easy to me and I liked it and I loved to read, that mother decided
that I was going to college.
BJA: And, your father didn't object?

1

Oladys Paine Johnson
OPJ: No, he was neutral about it. And, he mellowed, as we said, in later life so
that his grandchildren were a great joy to him. Do you want more about why I
chose Brown?
BJA: Yes. Yes, definitely.
OPJ: Mother had picked Mount Holyoke, and that's funny when we think of the
President of Mount Holyoke being a Brown graduate at that time. But, it was near,
you see, I lived in Massachusetts, near South Hadley. And, she thought that the
travel wouldn't be as expensive. And, so I made the application to Mount
Holyoke, but I lacked one subject that was necessary - I can't remember what it
was. But, so, that was when I became interested in Brown, through this man who
was the principal. And, I think that's all about why I chose Brown, but I'm so glad
I did.
BJA: Yes, isn't that funny how these little decisions can affect one's whole life.
OPJ: Yes, that's very true.
BJA: Just who you know at what point in time, it's just, interesting that he
happened to be there and he happened to be from Brown.
OPJ: There so many things in my life that have come without my trying to get
them, and I can't understand why I have been so lucky. Do you want me to go on?
BJA: Sure.
OPJ: I think it was most fortuitous that I entered Brown in nineteen-nine. That
might not seem to very important to you, but it was a period of transition because,
although, the Women's College in Brown University was founded in 1891- and
Miss Woolley was one of the first entrants - I can remember that date because that
was the day I was, the year I was born. And, now in nineteen-nine, I am in the
class that is the last one to spend a year on Benefit Street in the mansion. And, that
I think was very important to me. And, then, you see, I went to, the next year, to
the Miller Hall, which was the first dormitory. So, it was this period of transition
that was so important to me. And, that's where I was so excited to see on page 112
of the Brown history, the Class that was, of the four Classes, that were in Benefit
Street.
BJA: Did you like living at Benefit Street better than the dorm?
OPJ: Yes, it was a very different kind of living. It was a mansion. The living
room was beautifully furnished. The people who came, like Sarah Doyle - she was
very awesome, but she had, she was up and I call, a lady, a regal lady. And, in
reading the Brown history I was astounded at how many things she had done
besides supporting the university for women.
BJA: What did she come for? Did she come to give lectures at your dorm?
OPJ: No, she would come to a Sunday afternoon tea. And, we would be very
proper and we would be properly dressed and we would have proper manners.
And, I remember the, Sally Ross, was the house mother and she used to give us
talks in a very kind way about us country people who didn't know anything about
elegant living. And, I think that it was a very different kind of living. And, from
being next door to my friend in a room by myself at Miller Hall and there were
many more people there too, by that time. You see, in my day about half of the
class would be day pupils who would come in from their homes, so that our class

2

Gladys Paine Johnson
at graduation was only forty-seven. So, you see, we weren't a big number of
people. We were very much influenced by that first year, I think, of the Benefit
Street living.
BJA: Did you find that there was a real separation between the city girls and the -?
GPJ: Oh, you knew the girls that, your first year became life-long friends. And, I
have kept that connection until, now, there are none of them living. I had some
friends that were city girls, but you didn't know them as well, and you didn't keep
the same - over these years, until the last one died about two years ago, I have kept
in touch with them as they went one by one into the next world.
BJA: Wonderful.
GPJ: So, I think that was very important. Do you want to ask another question?
BJA: No, you can just continue. You've done a very goodjob of preparing for
this interview.
GPJ: Well, I wanted to tell you something about the selection of courses. We
didn't have any counseling in those days . (BJA: No.) You did what you wanted
and I can't tell you how many times I had heard lectures at Brown on the
importance of liberal arts. (BJA: Yes.) And, you can learn your trade after you get
out of school. But, do take the enrichment courses and I took that very literally.
And, I did take the liberal arts courses. I, when I went, I knew what I was going to
do and why I was going to do it. There was no quesbon - I was going to be a
teacher. And, I was going to teach mathematics because of the teacher that I had
had in high school had made me love the study of mathematics. But, in addition to
that, I was very poor in languages and I loved studying art, public speaking; Latin,
I think, is fundamental and I can't see why it isn't stressed in the high schools
today because it is of, the basis of all - what kind of languages do you call them? ­
romance languages. But, I was very poor in French and German and I never
studied Spanish. And, I loved taking Astronomy. And, I loved my course in
American Poetry. You see, those were all things that would stay with me all my
life.
BJA: It's true.
GPJ: I think, especially, public speaking has been so helpful because I have done
so much of that in different fields of interest in my life since.
BJA: That was Professor Crosby; remember, you had asked in your book, I noted,
that was Prof. Crosby who was your speech teacher.
GPJ: Yes. I had been amazed in looking over this period of history at how many
of the professors I had were worthy of including in the history because they were
experts. And, so then cam the question - why did they come over, you see, to the
Pembroke Campus and let us have full professors, instead of instructors? I, I, you
know, I don't know the answer, but I kind of guessed. Maybe, they got working
with the women.
BJA: Maybe the women were better students.
GPJ: Well, I never thought of that. Maybe, they liked the smallness of the classes
- you could go one on one. Maybe, they liked the addition to their salary because I
understand professors weren't very well-paid. So, that leads, I think, right into
some of my famous, favorite professors. (BJA: Yes.) And, of course, Tom

3

Oladys Paine Johnson
Crosby would be one that you would think of, inevitably - the bon vivant, as they
say. I want to tell just an anecdote in my public speaking class - I think this might
be in my book. He put some titles on the platform in Pembroke Hal1. And, we had
to go and, just at random, speak for two minutes on the topic. And, I looked at the
topic, I can't remember what it was, but I knew nothing about it. So, I got up and I
said, "My topic is so-and-so, and that reminds me that some of you haven't paid
your class dues. And, then I went on and talked for two minutes on how, as the
class treasurer. And, when I got off the platform, he said, "Very, very verbose,
but not very much connected with the subject." (BJA laughs) I love that story!
And, I have another funny, not funny, but, anyway, I think this isn't in my book.
Uh, uh - what's his name? Oh, uh, I can't remember it right now, but it will come
back to me. Maybe, I might mention some of the professors in mathematics that I
was very impressed with and learned much from - Archibald, Richardson, and
Matting. Not too long ago, they wrote to me and asked me about my
remembrances of Matting. Now, to me, he seemed so old, and he really wasn't so
old at that time. But, they all seemed to have beards which added to the years, you
know. But, he gave us, at one time, a textbook in French. I don't know how I
ever passed that course!
BJA: Did somebody help you? Did you get fellow students to help you?
OPJ: No, r just, I think he helped me some. But, I did pass it, but I think he must
of been kind of, very sweet and long-suffering. Oh, the man I wanted to speak to
you about, who was quite famous in those days, was the provost, Sam Arnold.
Well, Sam Arnold was a math major, and, in the higher classes, you had to go to
the campus to get the mathematics. And, one day I was standing next to him at the
board, we both had a project to complete, and he got stuck, and I gave him a hint
and then he went on and completed it. I have always been so proud that I could
help Sam Arnold!
BJA: Provost. (laughs) Was there any problem with a woman majoring in math?
Were there other women?
OPJ: Of course, there were some, but we were queer.
BJA: You were?
OPJ: We were queer.
BJA: Oh.
OPJ: How anybody ­
BJA: Even then, huh?
OPJ: At that time, how anybody would major in math, they don't know? Another,
well, let's pick up my favorite dean - Dean King taught Latin and I took a course in
Latin with her. She was very strict. We were a little scared of her, but she was an
excellent dean and r think she impressed me very favorably. Her mind was so keen
and her - of course, they always gave little homilies at chapel. And, she always had
something worthwhile to ­
BJA: What was your relationship with her? Did you, was she just someone who
talked in front of you or did you have any personal relationship with her?
OPJ: She was not very approachable and you wouldn't - but, I did have a good
relationship with her because I did have this course with her. And, I can remember

4

Gladys Paine Johnson
going to her office - why I don't know - but that was rather unusual. Another
professor who impressed me was Everett, Prof. Everett. He specialized in
philosophy. Am I going into too much detail?
BJA: No, this is wonderful.
GPJ: He was a very good philosopher. But, 1 can remember that, what we use to
can a "greasy glind," would take over the class and would discuss something with
Everett on a level much too high above me. And, I would either day dream or wish
that the class was over, or something. I didn't do what I should have in philosophy
because she sort of took over.
BJA: Oh, it was a woman.
GPJ: She was a woman in my class.
BJA: Uh, huh. I was going to say, "I bet it was a man." (laughs)
GPJ: The professor was the man. And, I suppose because her mind was so keen
that he liked to discuss these things with her, but it would take the time from the
rest of us. Prof. Upton, in astronomy, I liked very much. In American Poetry, I
had Prof. Bronson. He was a little gruff, but he was an excellent teacher and I've
always Joved those poems of the last part of the nineteenth century that aren't
fashionable anymore. And, he had a niece in my class, so I felt sort of that name
Bronson meant something to me because I corresponded with her after we
graduated. 1 liked a Prof. Poland in art and I have tried to do things in art. And,I
loved to visit all the rut galleries that anybody would take me to ­
BJA: Wonderful, wonderful.
GPJ: In my wheelchair. That has meant a great deal to me in my after-life. So,
that's - oh, and of all the Presidents, come President Faunce was there for a long
time. But, the President I remember best, after my graduation, is President
Wriston. Whatever he did, whatever he said, I agreed with him one-hundred
percent and, of course, he had a very good career after his presidency at Brown.
BJA: How about the dean, you said Lida Shaw King was your favorite dean - was
there another one there?
GPJ: No. Dean Moniss came after me, and she was very much a more
approachable, if you know. It was, and she was very much easier to talk to and
she was - I guess that old-fash-, much-used word, charismatic. She was a lovely
woman. And, of course, going back for reunions, as I did because I lived fairly
near Providence, most of my manied life, I would get in touch with all of these
new people. And, but, I think for what I needed at that time in my life that Dean
King was the answer.
BJA: Well good.
GPJ: Now, the final program of, paragraph that I have in this outline is my debt to
Brown. And, maybe we can, unless you have some other questions?
BJA: Well, uh, no, just, let's see ... um, you said you had no counseling, you
never had any kind of counseling about what you were going to do?
GPJ: No, no. Nobody ever told - and there's one anecdote to that. When I
graduated, I had honors in math. And, one of the math professors said, "Oh, if

5

Gladys Paine Johnson
you had only taken one course in science or physics, chemistry or something like
that, you could have made Sigma Psi. Your grades were good enough. Well, it
didn't break my heart because I didn't get Sigma Psi because I think those keys are
a little overrated sometimes. You know, the men always wear them across their
vest.
BJA: Or their key chain.
GPJ: And, it's nice to have the awards, but you're life isn't ruined if you don't.
BJA: No, that's true.
GPJ: But, I was pleased to know that it was a possibility. Now, maybe if I had
counseling, they would have said, "Your mind should go this way." In fact, when
I taught, the first year and the principal was fired, but he wouldn't admit it, and I
had to teach beginning physics for six weeks until we got another principal.
BJA: Oh my! That must have been difficult.
GPJ: Well , it wasn't too difficult because I read ahead. And, the experiments I
couldn't do, I just passed over. And, I didn't tell them that, I told them the truth
that I was studying it with them. And, we got along beautifully.
BJA: Great. Great.
GPJ: I don't believe in trying to overrate yourself.
BJA: You were also involved, you were the class treasurer, so you were really
involved with events at Brown .
GPJ: Yes, I was class treasurer and - of course, we didn't have so many djfferent
people to chose from, but I got... And, we, I was in the Sophomore Masque, the
lead. And, I was the leader of the Glee Club. And, I did not, we had sororities at
that time, I did not join a sorority for two reasons. One was that I couldn't afford
it. And, I didn't really think it was too important. And, there was another
reason ... uh, I didn't get the bid from the one I wanted. (BJA and GPJ laugh) The
other was very nice and they were nice girls, but my special friends were going into
this one and so, I said no. But, of course, that isn't as important - I don't think
they have any sororities, do they now? With the girls?
BJA: Perhaps, yeah, they have some, especially, the black students have sororities
and fraternities which they feel are very important to them as a support group.
GPJ: It would be.
BJA: Yeah, yeah. But, you had your friends at the dorm anyhow? You had all
your connections.
GPJ: I didn't need it, really. And, shortly after I graduated, I believe, they did not
have sororities in the - of course, we were, originally, the Women's College in
Brown University, then we became Pembroke and now we are just the same as the
men.
BJA: Right, now it's just Brown. Does that bother you? Do you ... ?
GPJ: No, it doesn't bother me at all because I got a Brown diploma.

6

Gladys Paine Johnson
BJA: Right. Right.
GPJ: And, there was nothing different with my diploma from the men on the hill.
BJA: Right. Right.
GPJ: So, uh ...
BJA: But some women feel that having the Women's College separate was very
important like, for example, like yourself, you became class treasurer. You were a
leader of your class and they felt that that gave women a chance to do that, where as
if it's men and women together, so often the women don't have a chance.
GPJ: Yes, that's true. I think it was, that story of the establishment of the
Women's College in Brown University is so exciting. And, I think those women
who belong to that society, led by Sarah Doyle, deserve so much credit because we
were able to take the good from Brown, you see, into our little group. And, now,
we are an intricate part of Brown University. And, I think that is so nice to think
back at. I'm very proud to have been a member of the Brown University.
BJA: That's wonderful. The Pembroke Center is planning a - the whole
University is planning a year-long celebration in 1991 of the centennial of the
Women's College of Brown. So, that will be exciting. I hope we can help you
around that weekend.
GPJ: I'll be there then. And, never mind, I go where I can, when I can. But, I'll
look forward to it with much pleasure.
BJA: You were going to talk about your debt to Brown. Is this ... ?
GPJ: Yes, and now one thing is the things that came to me unsure and unexpected
all my life, afterwards, and I think it was the foundation that I got in Brown
University that brought these things to me. For instance, I have been very active in
my church work, and I have had many leadership jobs, the one that I think is the
most important was to be the moderator of the whole church assembly. I have been
active in DAR work. I have been Regent twice. And, incidentally, I never would
have been it if somebody hadn't been interested in genealogy and gave me all the
facts and figures and I didn't always agree with all they did. But, I had a very
pleasant experience with them. I have been President of my Connecticut State
Federation of Women's Clubs and I didn't go through the steps, with Second Vice­
President, First Vice-President - they came to me and asked me to fill in because of
some problem. During the War, I was an advisee on the Governor's War Council.
And, after that, I was asked to take, in my section of the state, the setting up of the
war bond process, or whatever you call it. I had to get a leader in everyone of the
fourteen towns in my county. And, none of those things did I want, particularly. I
didn't go through the regular channels, but I think it's the background of the wide
range of interests and I think, probably, you can call me an activist because if I
belong to something, I want to work for that something rather than to sit back and
take in. It's a peculiarity of some people that they want to be active, and others just
hate it. Now, this is what I thought why lowe the debt to Brown - because, when
I was there, I had a library. I could find the books, whatever I wanted, for any
subject that I wanted. I had professors who were leaders in their field and through
their. ..

Gladys Paine Johnson
GPJ: I've been doing too much here in the house. I prepared a program yesterday
and I'm doing one two weeks from now.
BJA: So, you're still an activist? [both laugh]
GPJ: I love to do it. Is it on now?
BJA: Yes.
GPJ: And, then the contact with the students to learn to live with different
personalities. I know that I am a great talker and I think when I first went as a
freshman, I did talk too much about my family and my dad.
BJA: You would talk too much?
GPJ: So, the upperclassmen gave me a, sort of, polite hazing, so that I knew that
what I was talking about wasn't of great interest to my peers. And I tried not to talk
so much about my family and my home. It hurt at the time, but I've been so
grateful to those upperclassmen. I can't remember what they did, but they made it
very polite that I was much too talkative. And, then I think my training in
leadership came because of these activities, extra-curricular activities, in the small
class because they had to take somebody, so they took me. [GPJ laughs]
BJA: No, no, your life has indicated that you were a leader, always, really.
GPJ: And then, I think living in the city of Providence did a great deal for me. I
had come from a small town. I knew nothing about urban living. And, I can
remember then, it was safe to walk out by yourself at night. And, I can remember
walking around the East side at night and if the curtain was up, I could see these
beautiful rooms with these lovely furnishings, you know. And, I felt sort of, I
didn't feel that I was spying, but I felt I was becoming a part of gracious living.
So, that's a very silly thing to say. But, I really do think there were so many
opportunities: there was the opera house, there was the art gallery, and, of course,
the gallery on the campus - Ann Berry Brown, I think it is [BJA: Yes.] - did you
ever see and do they still have "The Rape of Poland" there?
BJA: I'm not sure.
GPJ: A huge canvas, and I use to go back there to see that and to feel so sorry for
Poland who was being, and is still being ...
BJA: I'll look that up. I've been in there recently, but I don't recall that painting.
GPJ: And, of course, the dormitory living was another thing that helped me
because you had to Ii ve wi th all ki nds of people. You had to learn to eat all kinds of
food [both laugh]. Some of it was good, some of it wasn't so good. But, I think,
just the fact that one of the wai tresses sent something to me just yesterday, he said,
I said, "Oh, that was a nice lunch!" "Would," she said, "you like everything
anyway!" [both laugh] And, I did feel that living in a dormitory, you took the
good with the bad. And, I think, especially, my living in Benefit Street House for
one year did quite a bit to rub off the rough edges of this country gal.
BJA: How was your relationship with the rest of your family? Did they think it
was strange that you were going to - what you were doing?

8

Gladys Paine Johnson
GPJ: No. They all helped what they could. I don't, I only remember one
experience of when I was with my nearest sister. We were up to Vermont - we had
been up to Quebec. And she was driving and she looked at the map and then - I am
a back-looker anyway - and I picked it up after she put it down and she resented it.
And, for the only time in her life, she says, "Well, I can read a map even if I
haven't got a college education. You're not so smart!" Well, that hurt me terribly
because I had never felt, I thought I was lucky to have a college education, but I
didn't think I deserved it particularly. And, I didn't think it made me any better
than the other members of my family. It was just pure luck and my mother's
determination.
BJA: Right, right.
GPJ: And, so, I don't take any credit for it. And, I have a very good friend that,
for a long time, I didn't know she wasn't a college graduate. She is what I call my
adoptive daughter. She's young enough to be my daughter; she's my very best
friend in Connecticut at this particular town. And, one time she confessed to me
that she felt inferior because she had been a typist and secretary and had not gone
to college. And, she is so interested in the world, in people, in learning, in reading
- she is so much more intelligent than many college graduates, I could tell you.
And, I tried to make her understand that you don't judge a person by their degrees.
And, so, I never felt any distance and only that one incident - I shouldn't have put
that on the tape, I guess.
BJA: Oh no, no. I think that's interesting because it was, you were the only one
out of seven children, and I think that's ...
GPJ: Yes, and we were very congenial. But, she was very different from me and,
when she visited me after she was a widow, I was perfectly exhausted - now, you
would think I would be the active one, but I wasn't. She was much more vivacious
than 1. And, so, I think that, perhaps, she was tired and she just shot back at me.
But, I never knew, except that one time, that she ever had any feeling that I felt
superior. And, I didn't, I honestly don't.
BJA: What was the relationship between the men on the campus and you women?
GPJ: Well, the girls who were day peoples knew loads of them. And, so, I think
they had a better relationship with the graduates of Hope because they were
graduates of Hope. I can't tell you much about the relationship with men because I
wasn't one that the men paid much ...
BJA: You weren't interested?
GPJ: Well, I won't say I wasn't interested, but they weren't particularly interested
[BJA laughs] But, I did manage to get engaged before the end of college.
BJA: Oh!
GPJ: But, that was only due to the help of one of these day pupils who found this
man for a dance for me because I didn't have any relationships with the men. I
don't, I think they sort of ignored us. I - the men, as a whole, I think they felt very
subservient and we were kind of - and, of course, some of the girls, I know one
who was very much interested in young men, and she deliberately took an
advanced course over to the campus to have an excuse for going there. [BJA
laughs] That's true.
BJA: That's the only reason you could go there was to take a course? Is that?

9

Gladys Paine Johnson
GPJ: Oh, you could walk over to campus. You could visit the art museum, you
could go to Manning Chapel.
BJA: Is it true that you had to wear gloves and so forth when you went to campus?
GPJ: Oh yes! Gloves and veil and hat - that was an entity, you know. We were
proper. It's hard for me to understand the way college people dress because just
the way all of their contemporaries do. But, it looks so sloppy. And, also, I think
it was Woolley that was added on to Miller Hall, wasn't it? And, at one reunion, I
was down there and I went into their beautifully decorated living quarters and there
were cigarette bums and scratches and ...
BJA: That's terrible!
GPJ: Oh, they don't take care of...
BJA: Yeah, that's, you're right, yeah.
GPJ: And, I think this, well, I call it sloppiness and lack of care for tangible
things. If they want to put their cigarette down here, what matters! They, I wonder
if they have any restrictions on smoking in any of the ... ?
BJA: I haven't heard of any. No. Unless, I think, maybe in some of the houses
that students themselves, the Governing Council, might pass a rule that says "You
can only smoke in such and such a spot." But, the University as a whole doesn't
have any yet.
GPJ: No. I'm hoping that they will more and more get away.
BJA: Oh, I hope so too .
GPJ: Both of my daughters were heavy smokers and both of them are off of it.
BJA: Good.
GPJ: And, I am so much happier in the car when we are driving places. [GPJ
laughs] I never told them that, but .. . They took that very strict course, you know,
where you celebrate at the end of it with a glass of champagne or something [GPJ
laughs]
BJA: Oh, well, it worked for them, huh?
GPJ: Yes. And, one, one of them, was a backslider for a while, but she's off of it
completely now.
BJA: Good, good.
GPJ: And, I'm very happy about that. And, we don't have any smoking here,
except in the Smoking Room. And, I wish they would close the Smoking Room
because it's awfully smelly. They go in there after a lunch and have a little smoke.
That's just the way I feel, but it's really medically awful.
BJA: Well, have you ... ?
GPJ: I think I've gone through Brown.

BJA: Gone through Brown. Okay, well, I'm going to talk a little bit about your life
after Brown though because you did go on to teach and ...
GPJ: Yes, I taught for nine years. And, then, I wanted to get manied because I
was, they were wonied because I wasn't ever going to marry. So, I found
somebody who would marry me. [GPJ laughs] I think that's really partly true - I
went after him. [GPJ laughs] But, then, I had to resign from my Hartford position
which I loved. Public high school was two buildings and that was the only high
school in the city at that time. But, they didn't keep manied teachers. I was
manied in April, so they let me finish the year, anyhow. But, then, my husband
was salesman at that time. And, so, as he was on the road, I decided that I'd go
back to a smaller high school where they would take me. And, so, I taught two
more years before my first daughter was born. And, so, my teaching, except for
substitute, which I didn't care for because you never teaching them anything, you
just keep [BJA: Order.] order, was eleven years. And then, after that, I became
more or less what you call a liberated woman. Because my husband was more
generous than he should have been and he was generous enough to live my own
life in my own way. And, he never said, "Well, I think you should stay home and
take care of me. I don't think you should take that trip because, what am I going to
do all alone here?" He, I can't understand even people my age not going to a
certain meeting because their husband didn't want to be left home.
BJA: And you had friends like that?
GPJ: I did and I couldn't understand it. She, one woman said to me, "I'd love to
pick you up for that meeting, but Honey doesn't like to have me go out at night."
Oh! Well, I think that was one reason that I was free. I didn't have any money,
but I had done a lot of traveling. Some of it under church auspices, some just for
fun. And, now, I'm taking last trips with my two daughters. [BJA: Yes, 1...]
And, we are thinking about Alaska cruise.
BJA: Wonderful! This summer?
GPJ: Yes, but I don't think I can afford it.
BJA: Oh. [both laugh]
GPJ: But, you know, you can afford what you want.
BJA: Want. Right.
GPJ: And, so, I would give up something else that doesn't mean so much to me.
But, the reason that I do go on these last trips is that these two sisters, who are
twelve years different in age and a thousand miles and more apart, are with me and
they can do things and I can rest. So, I rationalize it.
BJA: It's a wonderful idea, yeah. And, then, sometimes your granddaughter, does
she still go, your granddaughter?
GPJ: No, she doesn't go anymore.
BJA: Okay.
GPJ: And, we only took her when she could go for half price. [both laugh] But,
now it's two of them and we - the other thing that I really was interested in doing
was to stay right here and have the girls come here because this makes into a bed
and then I have a mattress that goes on the floor. And, get a Fodor (?) for New

England and visit some of the places around here. Now, strangely enough, I have
never been to these concerts up in...
BJA: Tanglewood.
GPJ: Yes. I've never been there. And, I'd love to go to a concert there. I love
music and I love the ballet. So, I know we could find enough to fill up our time
and we could come back here and sleep, if we wanted to. If it was too far, we
could stay anywhere.
BJA: Right.
GPJ: That is what I think my age needs. But, I don't want to say no to the other
two, if they want to do it. And, it so happens that there is a reunion of the 10th
Mountain Ski Division in Seattle this year that my son-in-law in Georgia would like
to go to. So, he and Ruth could go to that and then we could join them for the
cruise part. So that's more rationalized.
BJA: That's wonderful that you're sti)] planning to do all these things.
GPJ: And, you know some of the ladies here think I'm crazy. [both laugh] "Why
do you want to do that?" Well, of course, traveling with them is no bother. They
take care of the money, you know we all chip in. They take care of all the
reservations. They make all the plans. They tell me what I can go and when I've
got to rest. So, it's just going along for the ride . And, of course, I take my
wheelchair. And, so...are you, is this the film or are we talking?
BJA: No, this, I'm still recording here. Let me just see if I, urn ...
GPJ: Have you recorded everything I am?
BJA: Yeah, any .. .! know you had a very interesting life. As you said, your
husband let you do a lot of things and you did a lot of things like start your own
little businesses. What you had?
GPJ: Yup, I did, he went into the ice cream business and did quite a bit of selling
outside. But, I opened this little lunchroom with ice cream in front and, of course,
the girls helped me with that.
BJA: You served sandwiches and things and ... ?
GPJ: Yes, we, hot-dogs and hamburgs, you know. Nothing elaborate. But, I did
make a little money on that project. It was awful hard work, though.
BJA: Oh, yeah!
GPJ: Because I was, I was working also - some of this was because of necessity,
some of it because I like to. I was for ten years in charge of the business end of a
medical clinic with five doctors. And that was very inter- ... And that was
something I didn't plan on it but they were right across the street from me in one of
these big old houses converted to offices. And, they needed a bookkeeper because
this secretary couldn't keep up and they were about six or eight weeks behind in all
their records. And, so, they came to me and asked me if I would be interested.
And, of course, the first thing I did was to get them caught up, then they were very
nice to me. And, every time they'd raise the nurses, I asked for a raise and got it.
BJA: Oh good. Good.

GPJ: But, sometimes it was because you needed the money and sometimes it was
because you liked to do the volunteer thing. And, I think I've covered - probably,
I've forgotten some of the things that I did. [GPJ laughs]
Tape recorder turned off.
