Derria Byrd: Derria Byrd interviewing Javette Laremont- November 5, 1 9 9 4 .
What were your l i f e experiences that led to your c o m i n g to Brown?
Javette Laremont: I would say that one of the major reasons I think I ended up at
Brown was because I had had sort of a background of very high academic
achievement. And I was determined to try to go to the best institution that I could
go to when I graduated from high school. At the time, Brown d i d n ’ t really m e a n
anything to me. It wasn't a well-known university among my circle of friends
so as I started to apply to other Ivy League institutions, I came across some
information on Brown but I think the pivotal point in my decision was when an
admissions officer came to our high school and then we started to talk about
Brown. And mentioned some of the people that had gone to my high school that
were currently at Brown. And that's what really led me to concentrate on
information about Brown and actually come here to visit Brown.
DB: So where are you from and w h a t your high school public or private?
JL: My high s c h o o l was public high school. I am from N e w Y o r k . I went t o the
Bronx High S c h o o l of Science.
DB: There is this big controversy now a b o u t whether Brown goes to private- is
recruiting - from like private or public schools. And now it's mostly private
schools that they go visit. (JL: Hmmm.) It's a big controversy now. How many
colleges did you apply to?
JL: I think I applied to between eight and ten colleges at the time.
DB: Were most of them Ivy League schools?
JL: I would say the bulk of them were Ivy League schools. I also applied to some
schools in the New York area thinking that I might want to stay closer to home.
DB: So you said that you had a history of high education in your family. Both of
your parents were...

	

Laremont-2

JL: No, I said personal high academic achievement (DB: Oh, okay.) but notneither parent ever attended college. High school was the highest level of education
in my family.
DB: So was it your own initiative to go on to college or is that what your parents
wanted as well?
JL: It was my own initiative. I mean I really enjoyed school and I really enjoyed
academics. I did really well - I was always like a valedictorian or salutatorian you
know in all of the lower grades. And once I went to the Bronx High School of Science
and that school has an 80% rate of people going on to college and higher learning. So
it just seemed natural to continue to go forward.
DB: What were your expectations corning to Brown?
JL: I don't know that I had expectations. I expected that I was going to get a solid
education. I think my expectations were that I would get a good education but I
would have a good social experience too because that was what I was looking for - to
have a social life.
DB: How was your high school dissimilar or similar to Brown?
JL: In terms of actual size, my high school was very similar to Brown. There were five
thousand students in my high school and there were five to six thousand students at
Brown at the time. So size was really an important factor. I felt comfortable in that
size institution. I also liked being sort of a leader and an activist and I knew that I had
been able to achieve a leadership role at my high school so I figured I could do the
same at a similar sized institution. In terms of ethnic background, my high school
was probably more Jewish and Asian than Brown was when I carne here. I think Brown
probably had more of a white Anglo-Saxon make-up than it had a Jewish or an
Asian constituency at the time that I attended Brown.
DB: What were the things that you remember most fondly about your time at Brown?
JL: I think the things that I remember the most are that I did have a lot of fun. I
remember my friends. I remember the relationships I developed with

	

Laremont-3

my professors. I just remember the feeling of community that I had when I
was here.
DB: What were some of the low points?
JL: The low points? I think there was some disappointment. I was in sports and I
was on the varsity volleyball team. I think it was disappointing because I
experienced some bad and it ultimately carne out that they were racial
problems but I never was really accepted as a full member of that team. More from
the coach. I think the other players accepted me as a good player. But, the coach no. Who only used me if it was politically correct use me. And she didn't really use
me that much so and I think I was really disappointed because that was one of the
things that I really wanted to pursue. I wanted to have an academic experience
as well as an athletic experience and a social experience.
DB: Was that the other sphere of your education in which you felt the racial
tension?
JL: Urn. (pause) Probably not as blatant. I mean the other times were more
kind of out of people's ignorance. I was a resident counselor the whole time
after my freshman year. And so I would have majority students as my
counselees and I mean there would be some stupidity on the part of the
students never having had contact with African American students. You know,
they'd say some stupid things. But once they were corrected, they never said
those things again and then you moved on. (DB: Right.) In terms of professors, I
think for the most part the professors treated you with respect if you worked hard
and achieved academically. I mean I'm not saying that they were my best buds
(DB laughs) but we did okay.
DB: Where did you live while you were at Brown?
JL: I always lived on Pembroke campus. I started out in Champlin. I lived in
Wooley and then I was a counselor in Andrews.
DB: How was the "dating scene"- the social life?
JL: Yea... (laughs) fun. (DB & JL laugh) It was very active when I was here. I think
because at the...I was here at the height of sort of the black experience at Brown.
I mean there...in my class we had over a hundred black students. And in
the other classes there were more than a hundred. So you know at

	

Laremont-4

any point in time, there were 400 to 500 blacks on campus. And you know.
Everybody was excited to see everybody so dating was fun actually.
DB: What class were you in?
JL: The class of '80.
DB: Did they still have the Transitional Summer Program when you came
here? (JL: [yes].) Did you go to that?
JL: No, I did not. I think we were one of the first classes to go through that
program. And I don't really know what the selection criteria was for that
program. But I wasn't selected to participate in that so...It was interesting to
come on campus and see the people that had been in the program and not being
part of the program. People had already formed their little cliques. But within a
couple weeks everybody just kind of blended together so it really didn't make
that much of a difference.
DB: What clubs or organizations did you participate in?
JL: Umm. The resident counseling program. The pre-law society. The
volleyball team. I played collegiate basket...! mean intercollegiate basketball,
not as a varsity team. Umm...I'm trying to think. Onyx. I was also a senior class
officer. OUAP. Rites and Reasons.
DB: You were all over the place. (laughs) (JL: Yea. (laughs)) Did you work while
you went to Brown?
JL: Yea I worked part time. I was a full financial aid student. So I had...you had to
have work-study in your package.
DB: Where did you work? Was it on campus or...
JL: Yea actually I had some pretty decent jobs. I never had to work in the
cafeteria or anything. I worked at the college venture program which I don't
even know if it exists now. But it was a program geared toward people that
wanted time off. (DB: Right.) Yea I actually was part of the founders. One of the
founders of that program. We found the jobs and everything. That was really a
great time. I did that for two years. I also worked in the library. And I also worked
with a professor - doing archival work. So that was my work study situation.

	

Laremont-5

DB: Much better than a dining hall. (JL: Yea. Really.) How were your strongest
friendships developed here?
JL: I think that the strongest friendships really probably came from the fact that we
were either from the same geography- you know like New York. So you go together
with your New York friends. I actually came here with one of my girlfriends from
high school. So we were roommates and then you know we kind of extended our
friends from there. But the nice thing is the people that I met like that first week
that I was in school are still my best friends now. And we get together at least once a
year. So it's pretty cool. You know I have great friends. And we still think we're like in
our teens (DB laughs) which is kind of scary. (JL & DB laugh)
DB: Socially would you say you interacted with people from the same racial like
religious backgrounds or were you kind of all over the place?
JL: Umm. I wouldn't say we were all over the place. I mean socially pretty much we
hung with kind of a Third World crowd. I say a Third World crowd for myself because
there weren't that many Latin American students on campus but I was like the one
person who had a Latin American boyfriend. So (laughs) from that point of view I
hung out with a Latin American crowd. And also in an African American crowd and a
lot of my friends were Asian American. But I think that was because I had come
from a high school where those groups kind of always interacted and always had a
lot of solidarity. So that is what I did. From another view point- economically
everybody was at a much higher economic level than I was. So at first I felt a little
bit put off by that. Because I came from the inner city, I came from the projects and...I
realized that these people didn't see that as a barrier to being friends. They were real
people. And so it all worked out fine.
DB: As far as being an African American woman- do you think that you had a
different experience at Brown than someone of another race or gender would
have had?
JL: Well I'm sure...I'm sure my experience was unique. For me it was unique
because when I was here I tried to embrace the fact that I was African American. So
my discipline was...what I ended up getting my degree in was English but I really
focused on African American writers - the African American experience- I tried to
get to know most of the professors on campus that were African American or
African - Anani (laughs). (DB laughs) So I

	

Laremont-6

really...that was the experience I wanted and that was why I chose Brown over
some of the other schools because I knew that these individuals were here
and I could reach out to them and hopefully they would reciprocate.
DB: How were student relations on campus versus off campus as far as
relations between colleges and different communities such as the black
community here with the black community at Johnson and Wales or RISD?
JL: Oh okay. Yea that's interesting. (pause) We didn't have that much contact
with students from Johnson and Wales. I mean RISD, yea. A lot just a lot of the
crowd were kind of like artsy kind of people so they tended to hang out with a
lot of kids from RISD. And we would have joint parties together. But you know
when it came to kids from PC or URI or whatever- you know we were never really
cool with kids from those schools. You know we were pretty sheltered here and
we never really thought about the kids from Johnson and Wales unless they
just came to the parties but...the scene...there was very limited off campus
interaction with other schools. Now there was a lot of off campus interaction
with the black community.
DB: Oh, as far as like the Providence community?
JL: Yea as far as the Providence community. I mean...actually one of my actual
work study experiences was off campus working in South Providence with the
Black Heritage Society. And I did research on the black church in Rhode Island in
the early 1800s. So I had to go into all the churches and read through their logs their church logs - and talk to the older people in the community. And that was
really a nice experience. And we did a lot of programs to outreach to the black
community in Rhode Island. So I felt that the black community and the black
community in Providence- we had sort of a nice relationship going which was
very difference from what Brown's relationship with them was.
DB: In and out of the classroom, how were relations between black men and
women on campus?
JL: They were pretty good. I mean it was because there was the sense of you
know we're in this struggle together. You know we didn't get here by chance and
we can't stay here by chance. So that if people were having trouble we would talk
to each other. We tried to treat each other with respect and help each other as much
as we can. I mean it wasn't always successful but we tried.

	

Laremont-7

DB: When I was speaking to Anita Spivey last week she said the thing that shocks her
the most was how it seems the relationship between black men and women has
seemed to change on campus and she just doesn't understand that at all.
JL: Yea, I don't understand it either. I mean you know I think it's just because
relationships in general have just changed so much but...Part of the experience at
Brown and you can ask anyone in our classes and we could name all the guys we
thought were like really fine. (JL & DB laugh) For real and then if you liked each
other you dated? (JL & DB laugh) Dating was part of our experience and now it's it's
sad because I know I just hear from the women that you know the men here aren't
happening. There's very little interaction and if there is interaction, it's not really
built around respect. And you know just it's sad. It's a very different experience. We
had this one situation…I can remember when I was a senior and I guess we thought
we were like wise old people (DB laughs) that could guide the freshman. And the
freshman men were trashing some of the freshman women and talking about them
really bad. And I remember we got the senior men to take the freshman men and sit
'em down and have this like rap group and talk about this stuff. But you know I don't
know what that was all about. I mean I think it was just more we felt like they should
be treating these women better and they weren't. So I don't know if it was effective
(DB laughs) but we felt morally obligated to make sure that these freshman men
knew that they couldn't go around treating people like this. So it was definitely
very different.
DB: What do you think Brown tried to or taught you about the role of women in
society?
JL: Um I think what I learned was that...because at the time Brown was trying to
recruit more and more women professors. And so I was seeing more and more women
in leadership roles. So I think that what I got out of the experience...because I think
the next class of women were a half and half class - half women and half men. I just I
felt like women could do anything they wanted to do as long as they were prepared.
I mean I still knew that even in this society that was dominated by men and men sort
of set the rules of the game but that if women could learn those rules they probably
could play the game even better. And that was part of my experience here. It was just
to try and be a leader even if it was originally designated a male kind of role. Which
if there was something that I wanted, I would just go after it and do it.

	

Laremont-8

DB: When you said it was 50/50 men and women, is that just in the Brown all
together or just in the black community?
JL: No. Brown altogether.
DB: Cause it's 7:1 in the black community (JL: Yea.) now - women to men. (JL:
Yes. I know.) Was it the same then or...?
JL: I think it was pretty even in the black community at that time. You know we
always felt there weren't enough black men (DB laughs) but I think that was just
more like the ones that we wanted to date. (JL & DB laugh) I think when you did a
physical count, it was pretty even. Maybe it was like 60 women and 40 men or
something along those lines.
DB: How big an issue was financial aid?
JL: It was a big issue. It was a big issue for me personally because even at the time
when I came here the tuition was ridiculously low in comparison to what it is now. It
was 2/3 of what my mother's annual income was. And so for me to make that
decision when I could have gone to the state university and not have the kind of
considerations...I wouldn't have had to work and all this other stuff. It was a big
issue. I mean I can remember there would be times when I couldn't buy books and I
just would have to go to my professors and say, "Look, I can't buy books for the class."
And they would just let me borrow their copies of books. So you know, it was real.
And it's got to be harder now...And it's got to be more difficult today than it was
when I was here.
DB: By the time I graduate it's supposed to be $30,000 a year. (JL: Yea, it's just
ridiculous) Who or what were your support networks while you were here?
JL: The support networks were weak at best. I mean we had the minority peer
counselor program as freshman. I mean but all of the support was geared towards
when we were freshman. So you got all of this hand holding and sense of security
when you were a freshman and when you became a sophomore you got this rude
awakening that you were on your own and that there was no lifeline so to speak. But
the good thing is that we had some good administrators. We had professors who were
willing to kind of serve as role models and help you through some difficult situations
and friends. I mean you had to go to upper-class people and you know just say,
"Look, I'm having a hard time. Can you help me? You know what should I do?"

	

	

Laremont-9

Whatever the role. And then we had Ferd Jones who was a psychologist- I think he
was a psychologist. But I mean you could talk to him on a one-to-one basis. And then
at the time that I was here, we had two black chaplains which was really nice because
even if religiously you weren't really active religiously, you still felt like you could go
to someone and talk to them in confidence about whatever was troubling you.
DB: What social or political issues were big on campus at the time?
JL: I mean it's a never ending saga. I mean the big issues were: financial aid, making
sure that Brown was committed to maintaining diversity, apartheid ...you know
we were...Brown's whole position in terms of its divestment from South Africa
were really really big at the time. And I think really more of a sense of making sure
that if you brought us here to the university but are we really participating as key
members of policy making in the course of the development of the institution. So
we really...our class really rallied around making sure that we were part of the senior
class officer structure- that we were in UCS? (DB: Urnrn Hmm.) And you know that
we weren't just focused on just like the Third World Center and OUAP. That we
really had some clout outside of our own community.
DB: Do you think that majority students were also rallying for issues that most
directly affected the minority students such as the diversity in the community...
JL: Well, it was I would say maybe 20% of them. You know. I didn't get the sense that
it was like a university-wide issue. Because at the time and you know it could be all
my perception but at the time most of the financial aid students probably were
people of color as opposed to the majority students. So you know if we were
rallying around financial aid, you know they were kind of like, "Well that's not really
an issue for me." But...because that was that was the roaring '80s where money is
flowing, their parents were workin' and on Wall Street making big bucks. And so
you know they weren't feeling the pinch yet. You know?
DB: Was there an "African Sun" while you were here?
JL: Yes.
DB: Was that a...it's not really used as much as it should be now. Like was its big
source of communication between the communities?

	

	

Laremont-10

JL: What it was it was an outlet for expression for people. And we had a lot of
people who were good artists, good writers and it just gave them another forum to
express themselves. I mean I don't think it was sort of our tribal drum that you
know (DB laughs) coming out in the "African Sun" like let's get together. (JL & DB
laugh) I mean so if we wanted a call to action I mean basically it was word of
mouth. We used the Third World Center to get together and organize so we didn't
really have a written vehicle that was where everybody got the news.
DB: Were there tensions between the black community and the Brown Daily
Herald?
JL: Yea but it wasn't always organized. I mean it was it would always be sort of how
they would represent some of the causes and some of the rallies that we would
participate in. And then we would like have meetings with the heads of the Brown
Daily Herald and say, "You know, you didn't get the story right. You misrepresented
us." And so forth. But again that was part of the struggle we felt that we
couldn't...nothing would really change at the Brown Daily Herald unless
somebody from our group was on the Brown Daily Herald. So we realize that you
couldn't expect the majority group to have any sensitivity to your issues if you
weren't active as a leader in that group. So our goal would to be to get someone on
that board; get someone to be an editor.
DB: How active was OUAP on campus?
JL: It was very active. It was very active because we were the class...we were the class
that came in because of the '75 take-over and OUAP came out of that whole
experience so. It was still alive. There was still a lot of in-fighting. You know it
wasn't like the whole black community embraced OUAP. It became very
revolutionary and then there was sort of a more of a moderate group that had issues
that were on their mind. And then the group of blacks who said, "I don't want to be
bothered with any of it." So you always still had you know...it only represented a
small portion of the population.
DB: Where there any courses on black issues? Like how strong was the Af Am Study
department?
JL: Yea that was probably the height of the Afro Am Study department. And then I
guess by the time I was graduating, it sort of declined. And then when

	

	

Laremont-11

we came here there were professors on campus that taught black...African
music. There were African dance classes. We had George Bass here so Rites and
Reasons was really at its strongest point. So there was just a lot that a black
student could choose from. A lot of things which would really pique their
interests whether it was you know academic or artistic. So...there was a lot for
us...There was also a sprinkling of black issues in other disciplines like
sociology, anthropology, history, am civ, semiotics. But it wasn't you know...it
wasn't a broad...you didn't get this broad sense that black issues were part of these
disciplines and all that kind of stuff. Most of the black professors were in the
English department at that time. I think there were five.
DB: Yea, the Afro Am department offers about three courses a semester right
now.
JL: Yea that's very different from...when I was here I mean you could take at least
twenty to twenty-five courses in Af Am.
DB: How were your classroom experiences? (JL: Relative to?) Your
interactions with other students, with the professors...
JL: They were all pretty good. I mean it's hard because it really depends on
your discipline. I mean I was in English. And the English classes tend to be small
- more seminar driven. So if you know you're in a class of ten to twelve
students maximum, so you are forced to have sort of a civil interactions with
your classmates just because you are really in such a small environment. Most of
the classes were very good experiences. I can't remember any bad academic
experiences. If they were that bad, I probably blocked them out. (laughs) But
I...I just don't recall any that were really that bad.
DB: Was there...was interracial dating an issue while you were here?
JL: It wasn't (pause) it wasn't widely done. But there was certainly people that
were in our class that were of mixed race that you know would choose to either date
white or black or whatever. I mean and we just accepted that. But we accepted that
because they were of mixed race, so we figured, okay fine, they can do what they
want to do. I mean I guess I was an interracial dater because I dated a you
know a Mexican American guy but I don't think people were like (pause)
antagonistic about interracial dating. I think it depended on the individual. If
they felt like this person was "truly black" and dated they could accept that. If they
felt that the person had never hung out in the black

	

	

Laremont-12

community and dated outside of the black community, I guess they just kind of
wrote them off. So that was the situation with that.
DB: That's kind of the same way it is now. Do...When you think about your Brown
degree and your experiences at Brown, do you feel like you achieved something
that wasn't initially meant for you? In the sense that like Brown is a white
institution and thus is mostly geared toward white students.
JL: No, I never felt...! mean I...I mean I certainly felt like the Brown
experience was richer than I ever thought it would be and...but I never felt like
it wasn't something that was I deserved or that I worked hard for.
DB: What do you think was missing from your education?
JL: For me, I think the only thing that I regret is not having taken advantage of an
international experience. And I just felt like I was so involved in being here that I
never really got out of here to kind of get another experience. But I think at the
time and I know at the time, as a financial aid student, if you went abroad you
weren't guaranteed your financial aid when you returned. So that was real. That
was a real issue. And I...there was no way I could jeopardize (DB: Right.) my
financial aid to go off to Africa or wherever I would have wanted to go.
DB: After graduation, how do you feel your classroom experiences benefitted
you?
JL: A lot of the benefit comes from the fact that I was at Brown, I am encouraged
to look at an issue from many different sides, to be very independent, and have
formalized rational thought around issues. And all of that has been very helpful.
Also because of the leadership experiences I had at Brown, I was good working
with a lot of different kind of people and trying to get them to work as a
community and come to some consensus. So all that has turned out to be very
valuable to me.
DB: So when you graduated, what were you intending to do with your
English degree?
JL: laughs. At the time, I thought I wanted to be an attorney so I thought I was
going to go on to law school and become an attorney and be a judge, I guess at the
time. I had clerked for a judge in the summer so I just knew I was going to be a
judge.

	

	

Laremont-13

DB: So what happened after graduation?
JL: A lot of things. There were a lot of personal things that had happened. I just
felt really burnt out after graduation and said I'm gonna take a year off and really
think about whether or not law is the decision for me. So in the meantime I had to
get a job and I ultimately (laughs) accepted a job that became my career. ·
DB: What did you do?
JL: I accepted a job at IBM in marketing here in Providence. So I went back home
to New York and then I worked for a summer teaching English as a second
language. And then I came back to Providence and worked at IBM marketing
computers and market planning and strategy and stayed there for
13 years. And now I work as a vice-president at an investment management
firm.
DB: Well, that's basically the bulk of the questions. Is there anything else you
would to talk about?
JL: No, thank you.
DB: Okay, well thank you.
