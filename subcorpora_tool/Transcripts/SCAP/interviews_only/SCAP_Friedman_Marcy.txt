GINSBURG: 	So I am Kayla Ginsburg sitting here with Marcy Friedman, Class of 1972 on May 25th, 2012 for the Alumnae Oral History Project.  So thank you so much for agreeing to be a part of this.
FRIEDMAN: 	Thank you for having me.
GINSBURG:	So I guess just to begin, how did you choose Smith?  How did you come to Smith?
FRIEDMAN: 	I didn't choose Smith.  Smith was chosen for me from the time I was five years old.  In the days when I went to Smith, a seven sister school was where your parents sent you if they had ambitions for your education.
GINSBURG:	So it was your parents that knew about it?
FRIEDMAN:	Yes, and I think at some point my grandmother had a friend who had a niece here --
GINSBURG:	Right.
FRIEDMAN:	-- or something.
GINSBURG:	Right.  So what were your first impressions of Smith when you came?
FRIEDMAN:	Oh, I was really so sheltered that I was not having any impressions.  I was so homesick and so unaccustomed to being on my own that I think it just took me a couple of months to adjust to being on my own.  And then when I began to make observations, I realized that Smith was unlike anyplace I had ever been.  For one thing, you know, I grew up in an apartment building in the Bronx and the people here were unlike any people I had ever met and the conservatism and traditionalism of the culture struck me immediately.
GINSBURG:	And you were really -- your year was really -- it seems like a bridge year between the '60s and the '70s, so did you see a lot of changes on Smith during the time as far as regulations or rules or just the general atmosphere?
FRIEDMAN:	Yes, it was a time of transition.  When I started here, we had parietals.  Do you know what those are?
GINSBURG:	Mm-hmm.
FRIEDMAN:	One of the young women I spoke with this afternoon had never heard the word.  We had house mothers, we had Thursday evening candlelight dinners.  We'd all run home from the library and put skirts on over our jeans.  We had cloth napkins with boxes for napkin rings and napkins to be held for a week until they were laundered.  We had a requirement that we had to know how to swim before graduating from college.  We had mandatory posture pictures.
GINSBURG:	I just learned about those today actually.
FRIEDMAN:	Yeah, and they were stolen periodically by a guy from one of the men's colleges.  But unless you had a physical condition then -- you know, they would take the shape of your spine, so you had to learn how to walk more -- in a more erect manner as part of your education.  And we had Friday afternoon teas, but it was also a time of great rebellion and a very heady time.  So those Friday afternoon teas for some of us were anything but a genteel occasion.   They were the time when we debated philosophy and politics and -- and we were protesting.  I was a member of the committee of -- the ad hoc committee of concerned students.  Have you heard about that?
GINSBURG:	Right, and you -- there was a student strike in 1970.
FRIEDMAN:	Yes.  And that committee was basically an anti-Vietnam War protest group, but I had a conception of myself completely overblown as it was, of myself as Madame DeFarge, and there were -- there was a woman who knit in those meetings and when I think back on it, I always thought of her knitting the names of all the people who would be brought down when the revolution came.
GINSBURG:	Was she actually doing that, or no?  (laughter)
FRIEDMAN:	No, I'm sure -- I'm sure she wasn't. We were just protesting the Vietnam War.
GINSBURG:	So was that the entire Smith community that was really behind that or what was the -- how did students navigate, you know, the Vietnam war and all these social movements that were going on?
FRIEDMAN:	Well, I think there were widespread protests on many of the campuses.  It was not, as I recall it, a minority of the students, but the students who were really politically active, and who rejected many of the traditional conventions were really a very small minority.
GINSBURG:	And you were a part of that or --
FRIEDMAN:	Yes, I was.  I took from the traditional culture what appealed to me.  For example, I acquired lovely manners that have stood me in good stead for my entire life.  But for me Smith, more than anything, was a background from which to distinguish myself, from which to separate myself and I left Smith College an emerging radical second wave feminist.
GINSBURG:	And did you learn that at Smith or --
FRIEDMAN:	Well, in some ways, yes.  I mean Smith was a very feminal experience.  There were women doing everything.  They were head of the student body.  They were top students in the class.  They were also the bottom students in the class.  They were the singers and the actors and the intellectuals and women were doing everything: some things very well and some things not so well, and that experience, I think was the greatest impetus to a feminist consciousness in my life.  But my -- and I think that there were many, many feminists who left Smith College; I don't think there were many radical feminists who left Smith College.
GINSBURG:	And you felt like you were really radical feminist at the time?
FRIEDMAN:	Yes, and I still do actually.
GINSBURG:	And how did you define that back then?
FRIEDMAN:	Well, I believed in autarchic self-sustaining feminist communities.  The thing is, I never went to one.  So my radicalism was really of an armchair nature. (laughter)
GINSBURG:	And in 1972 when you left Smith were there still house mothers?  Was there still those kind of regulations or --
FRIEDMAN:	I don't know if we still had house mothers by '72.  I'm pretty sure parietals were eliminated by that time.
GINSBURG:	Okay.
FRIEDMAN:	I don't think we had housemothers.
GINSBURG:	So was there a sense on campus that there were these kind of newfound freedoms happening or --
FRIEDMAN:	Yes, we -- I mean we protested to end parietals.
GINSBURG:	Oh, okay.
FRIEDMAN:	And it was a small protest, and I remember getting up at dinner one night -- you know, we had dinner in the house system.
GINSBURG:	Right.
FRIEDMAN:	So you didn't necessarily know a tremendous number of people because the house system tended to isolate, but one night -- it was the Grape Protest.
GINSBURG:	Grape?
FRIEDMAN:	Grape, G-R-A-P-E.  Cesar Chavez, the farm workers, and we had grapes.  It was one of the great Smith deserts, green grapes in sour cream with brown sugar and I remember getting up on my chair and taking my knife and striking my glass with it and I said, "Everyone, send your grapes back."
GINSBURG:	And did they?
FRIEDMAN:	Some people did.
GINSBURG:	So what other kinds of activism were you involved with on campus?
FRIEDMAN:	It was really all centered around the Vietnam War in those days, much more than feminist activism.  That was more theoretical.
GINSBURG:	Mm-hmm.  And around this time I think Smith was admitting more women of color.  How did that change campus?
FRIEDMAN:	It didn't -- it didn't change the campus at all at the time.  I think it wasn't until the '80s when protests over the treatment of women of color and over the racism began to make some changes here.  I've only read about that.  I think the women of color were segregated in certain dorms and there was no wide acceptance.
GINSBURG:	Do you think that segregation was chosen or kind of enforced?
FRIEDMAN:	Well, that's a good question.  I don't know -- I don't know the answer to that because that -- that was also the days of the Black Power Movement and I know at Amherst, I had friends there that there were dorms that were segregated for -- out of choice.  I don't know about Smith.
GINSBURG:	In 1970 I think that there was some sort of racist incident and there was a lot -- there was a report by some sort of student committee about it.  Do you remember anything about that or -- in 1970?
FRIEDMAN:	I don't remember.
GINSBURG:	That’s okay.  So --
FRIEDMAN:	But I will ask at the class dinner tonight.
GINSBURG:	Oh, yeah, that would be interesting.  So I don't know if you -- did you -- when did you -- did you come out while you were at Smith or no?
FRIEDMAN:	No, there were no out lesbians when I was at Smith, and I was not a lesbian when I was at Smith, although I was interested in women, but I don't think I had conceived the idea of being with a woman sexually.  I'm going to -- I have to clarify that.  In my senior year I was living at the senior house and there was one lesbian couple, and I would hear ringing through the hallways, one of them calling for the other, "Mary," all day long.  But that really was the first out lesbian couple I knew of here and there was a lot of tittering about those two women.  When I was a freshman, I was invited to a lesbian party though.  The lesbians must have seen something in me that I haven't quite identified in myself and none of those women were out either, but interestingly one of the women was wearing a wolf skin and she was completely nude underneath it.  Do you know about the wolf girls of Vassar?
GINSBURG:	Yes.
FRIEDMAN:	Well, one of the women whose story is written about in that book had a father or a relative who supplied pelts, and sent her a wolf skin.  And she would wear it and she would howl under the moon at the Vassar campus.  So I'm thinking, looking back on this, that there was some sort of underground knowledge about that.  I don't think we are going to elevate it to the level of the tradition of that act of Vassar women and that that wolf skin might have been an act of sympathy, the wearing of the wolf skin.
GINSBURG:	So can you tell me a little bit about this lesbian party?  It was -- how did you know that it was a lesbian party if no one was out?
FRIEDMAN:	Well, I know it in retrospect.
GINSBURG:	Okay.  (laughter)
FRIEDMAN:	I know 10 years or 20 years later.
GINSBURG:	And were there discussions on campus about sexuality or same sex or sexuality or just sex in general?
FRIEDMAN:	If there were discussions, I was not privy to them.
GINSBURG:	And how did the campus react to that one lesbian couple?
FRIEDMAN:	I think there was just a lot of twittering -- twittering?
GINSBURG:	Tittering?
FRIEDMAN:	Tittering.  (laughter)
GINSBURG:	Same thing.
FRIEDMAN:	My speech has been corrupted by technology.  Well, it's not so different, but it wasn't -- you know, it wasn't reinforcing behavior.
GINSBURG:	Right, right.  So when you graduated from Smith, what were the expectations for a Smith graduate specifically, but kind of women in general.  How did you follow that path or branch out from that path?
FRIEDMAN:	Well, I have often thought over the years that the purpose of a Smith education was not to educate women so that they would go out on their own, at least I'm not talking about now of course.  I'm talking about at the time I was there and before.  It was so that they would make good wives and mothers, and that was never the case for me.  I had a mother who was terribly unhappy in her marriage and who didn't want me to be dependent on a man and I wanted to be a school teacher for elementary school, and she just wouldn't hear of it.  She told me probably at the same age I was told I was going to a seven sister's school that I was going to be a lawyer.  And so for me, after Smith, I really didn't want to be a lawyer.  I wanted to be an academic, and I went to Oxford to read for a second BA in philosophy and politics, which was something that a lot of American students did in those days.  I don't know whether they still do.  But I really wanted to teach college, and I just didn't -- I really was still pretty sheltered and I didn't have the nerve to buck the parental design, so I went to law school.  I don't think you asked me about that, but somehow I got there.
GINSBURG:	So you went to Oxford right after Smith?
FRIEDMAN:	Yes, I did.
GINSBURG:	So what was it like experienced or having the Vietnam War still go on and all of these -- you know, the feminist movement sort of explode and how was it being in England during that time?
FRIEDMAN:	I was a very serious student in England, and I was not doing anything but studying.  And the reason I was such a serious student there is that I didn't really get a formal education at Smith College.  Part of the changes that you asked me about before were the giving up of a core curriculum and any requirements other than that one requirement of six semesters of gym.  I have a little more to say on that, but I'll try not to digress.  So I was taking courses that really interested me and that were important.  Things like courses on media issues and Upanishads and the sociology of protest and Russian.  I took intense Russian the way kids take Chinese now, but I -- I wasn't studying the great books and I wasn't studying philosophy or the history of ideas, which were the subjects that came to interest me.  So once I realized that I wanted to read those books, I went and read for a second B.A. and I did nothing in England, and I mean nothing, but study.  I would go to bed at 4 in the morning and get up at like 2 in the afternoon and go running to -- they didn't really have classes, they were lectures, but you met in tutorials one-on-one with the professor and I was really trying to learn.
GINSBURG:	So tell me about these six semesters of gym requirements and what were your thoughts on that?
FRIEDMAN:	Well, first of all we had bloomers.
GINSBURG:	Still?
FRIEDMAN:	The bloomers were the color -- your class color.  We had blue, one-piece bloomers, and why did we have so much gym?  Because Smith had a master's program and they needed students for the master's and possibly also because it was part of this traditional notion of what a well-educated woman who was going to make an elite wife and mother would need to be able to do.
GINSBURG:	So when did the -- when did they drop the distribution requirements?  Was that while you were at Smith?
FRIEDMAN:	No, I think it was before.  And I'd like to know when they dropped the bloomers.
GINSBURG:	In all my research, I didn't find that out.
FRIEDMAN:	What have you learned that I haven't told you about that you think I might want to know?
GINSBURG:	Well, we can talk about it afterwards.  So did you have any favorite Smith traditions while you were at Smith?
FRIEDMAN:	I think you know the answer to that question by now.  I was against the traditions and in fact, I -- this is the first time I've ever thought that I might wear white and march in the alumni parade.
GINSBURG:	What's changed?
FRIEDMAN:	What's changed is that a friend of mine who is pretty new age is coming back and she said, "I don't get the whole thing, bringing white clothes to march around in."  And I thought, "Okay, I don't have to have such a political position on women of this certain age getting dressed in the color of the virgin."
GINSBURG:	Mm-hmm.  So how do you feel like -- I know you're a judge now and how do you feel like the Smith education has affected your life's work or your personal life after leaving?
FRIEDMAN:	Well, I think -- I credit Smith with helping me to develop the feminist values and the commitment to social justice that have been the most important commitments in my life.
GINSBURG:	And I know you said when you first got here you were sort of hit with this kind of conservative atmosphere, and what do you think were some of the best and some of the worst parts of Smith while you were here?
FRIEDMAN:	The heady intellectual debates that we had.  The smell of the grass.  I smelled it today.  It was being mowed.  The beauty of the place.  And the worst?  I can't give a politic answer.
GINSBURG:	It doesn't need to be politic.
FRIEDMAN:	I -- it does need to be politic, and I can't -- I can't do it.
GINSBURG:	Mm-hmm.  So when you were graduating -- I don't remember if I've already asked this, but what were the expectations for you -- I did already ask this?  I'm sorry.
RIDEOUT:	That's okay, but -- yeah, you could go into to just what went into the rest of your life, your Smith experience.  You did that a little and then you stopped.  Between Oxford and your current position.
FRIEDMAN:	What the expectations were for me?
RIDEOUT:	Or how Smith influenced it.
GINSBURG:	How Smith influenced --
RIDEOUT:	Your whole life.
GINSBURG:	Yeah.
RIDEOUT:	All your actions and --
FRIEDMAN:	I don't think I really have more to say about that.  I think I developed the feminist values that I hold so important and the commitment to social justice.  But there were many other influences on my life.  I hope that I've continued to grow and to learn after leaving college.  Smith did quite a bit though.
GINSBURG:	Mm-hmm.
RIDEOUT:	Do you have friendships that influenced your life that you've kept since Smith?"
FRIEDMAN:	I do have friendships that I made here that I kept, but these are not my closest friendships.  They are people who I admire and enjoy seeing though, and -- oh, two of the four of them are back for this reunion.
GINSBURG:	So why did you choose -- do you come back to reunion often or --
FRIEDMAN:	No.
GINSBURG:	Why did you choose to come back to this reunion?
FRIEDMAN:	I thought it might be the last one where I would still be able to walk. (laughter) The last one I went to was the 25th reunion.
GINSBURG:	So do you remember --
FRIEDMAN:	It seemed like a big one, let's put it that way.
GINSBURG:	Well, do you have any advice for kind of current and future Smithies?
FRIEDMAN:	No.
GINSBURG:	No, no advice?
FRIEDMAN:	No, I would really want to know who I was talking to before I deigned to give advice and I'd want to make sure they wanted it, but Smith has a very diverse student body and I don't think I could give general advice that would be useful or well-received by all.
GINSBURG:	Mm-hmm.  Well, do you have any last questions?
RIDEOUT:	No, just --I mean you talked a little bit about how it's changed since you've been here and is that something you've supported or are against?
FRIEDMAN:	I really don't know too much about how Smith has changed, because I haven't been very active in alumnae affairs, as grateful as I am to Smith for what I got here, but I’ve had other interests.
RIDEOUT:	The grass still smells the same.
FRIEDMAN:	It does still smell the same --
GINSBURG:	Yeah.
FRIEDMAN:	-- but I've had other interests, but I do think the challenge for Smith is to continue to be relevant in a world where women can attend any institution they choose.  I don't know if I said this, but in my day none of the elite male educational institutions were open to women.  They started going coed in my sophomore year, so this is where you went if your family was concerned about your getting a good education, and I think -- I've seen Smith create an engineering program in an effort to stay relevant.  I really -- I don't know if that's enough.  I really don't.  I mean -- and as far as being a welcoming institution for lesbians or transgendered people, my understanding is that it hasn't been and -- or that its efforts have been very problematic in that respect.  So I'm not saying that that would be the only thing that Smith would do to keep relevant, but it has a problem now because it's not -- it doesn't have the institutional cachet that it once had.
GINSBURG:	And were there conversations going on while you were there about Smith becoming co-ed?
FRIEDMAN:	There have never really been serious -- you know what, there were conversations and I think people like me were adamantly opposed to Smith going co-ed because we had a vision of Smith really becoming a validly, explicitly feminist institution and that never happened.
GINSBURG:	Was the Women's Resource Center around when you went to Smith?
FRIEDMAN:	I don't think so.
GINSBURG:	Okay, interesting.
FRIEDMAN:	If it was, then it was at the very end.
RIDEOUT:	I don't think we have what she's doing now or what her career path has been, just a summary.
GINSBURG:	Yeah, can you talk a little bit about like the highlights of what you've done since leaving Smith and what you're doing right now?
FRIEDMAN:	Sure.  I am a New York State Supreme Court Justice.  I handle civil cases in a wide variety of matters.  We -- judges are really the last of the generalists, and I have an area of concentration in mass torts, which are cases involving claims against pharmaceutical companies and occupational exposure to asbestos and the like.  I started out briefly in a corporate law firm, and I went very early in my career to the legal services providers in New York where I was providing civil legal services for the poor and then managing an office which provided civil legal services and apart from that I just -- I had a lot of fun personally, as well as professionally at times.
GINSBURG:	Mm-hmm.  Great.  Well, thank you so much.
FRIEDMAN:	Okay, thank you
