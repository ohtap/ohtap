Flynn-Do: This is Meiko Flynn-Do with the Stanford Historical Society’s Oral History
Program. Today is May 9, 2016. I’m here with Mrs. Roslyn Bienenstock, and
we’re conducting this interview at her home as part of the Stanford
Community Oral History Project.
So, Mrs. Bienenstock, can you tell me a little bit about where you’re
from and your childhood?
Bienenstock: I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. And you can probably hear it. [both
laugh]
Flynn-Do: What was Brooklyn like at the time you were growing up?
Bienenstock: I think it was, even by the time I was born, a pretty big city. All my
grandparents were immigrants to the United States, and when I was young,
we lived with my grandparents and some aunts and uncles, and some other
children, in a big house on the water, at a place called Seagate.
[00:01:16] It was actually a rather nice place to grow up. It wasn’t
what people think of, a crowded New York City environment. It was a
house built by a movie star, Douglas Fairbanks, when the movie studios first
opened in New York. And it was a fun place.

11

I liked living in that big family environment. It was just at the tail end
of the Depression, which was why so many people who were either
immigrants or first-generation lived together. [00:02:07] It’s a situation that’s
being repeated these days in many places. For a child, it was really a very
warm, loving, active environment. There was always something going on.
There were always people who wanted to pay attention to you. I think I was
happy there.
But it was World War II, and we were on the water in New York. My
mother was an air raid warden, so we patrolled the waterfront, looking for
submarines. And that could be a little scary because people took it seriously.
It wasn’t recreational. So it was not the most ordinary childhood, but I think
it’s part of an American story.
Flynn-Do: Can you tell me about your grandparents and what it was like for them
being first-generation immigrants?
Bienenstock: They were both from Russia, and they spoke Yiddish to each other, which I
think was common. But my family, and my mother in particular, did not
want me to learn either Yiddish or Hebrew, just to learn to speak English.
And that’s what I did. I regret it, but I think that’s also common, that
American parents are very anxious for their children to be assimilated into
the culture. And I certainly was.
Flynn-Do: [00:04:04] Does that mean it was hard to talk with your grandparents? How
was their English?
Bienenstock: They spoke English, not terribly well, but they did. My grandmother was
very proud of the fact that she did not come over as a poor immigrant. Her

12

family had been pretty well off in Moscow. But it was the period of the
pogroms in Russia--it was earlier than the Russian Revolution when she
came. She was a typical grandmother figure in my life. She did most of the
cooking. [00:04:56] She did a lot of babysitting of me and of my cousin. She
was very warm and had a lot of old-country superstitions, which were hard
to keep up. [laughs] She definitely believed in the evil eye, and she couldn’t
carry out the particular tradition of throwing salt in the fire when you came
home. That didn’t work. But she was absolutely the matriarch of the family.
Flynn-Do: Is this your maternal or your paternal grandmother?
Bienenstock: Maternal. I had no paternal grandparents. They both died when they were
very young, which is also, if you read American history, pretty common.
Immigrants lived in crowded situations and there were a lot of epidemics
like typhoid in the slum areas.
Flynn-Do: [00:06:08] Did either your father or your maternal grandparents tell you any
stories about when they first came to the US?
Bienenstock: Not very much. My grandfather never did. He was bitter about his
experiences in Russia, and he really didn’t talk about that except to warn me
never to go there. My grandmother came from a big family and she did talk
about it, but only a little. She was literate. My grandfather hadn’t been very
educated.
[00:07:03] They were Jewish and so, of course, all Jewish men can
read in Hebrew. They learn that from the time they’re little boys. But he
never read English. She could read English and speak English reasonably
well. When Arthur and I got married, and we were going to move to

13

Cambridge from New York, she told us to continue our educations. It
turned out that was the first place she had ever lived in the United States,
and she could not understand why we would go there because she saw that
as the place where “greenhorns” went. That’s the term for new immigrants.
[laughs] She thought it was a very unwise move.
Flynn-Do: [00:08:04] You talked about her being a matriarch, so clearly when you got
married, she expressed that. Are there other ways that you noticed her being
a matriarch in your life?
Bienenstock: I think it was more with her children. She had four children, and they all
remained very close to her until she died. When she was an older widow,
and my mother and my aunt were widows, she lived with them. But all her
children called her every single day, her whole life.
Flynn-Do: That’s amazing. So will you tell me a little bit about your mom then?
Bienenstock: She grew up in Boston and New York, and part of my grandmother’s family
always stayed in Boston. [00:09:10] She went to high school in New York to
a school called Julia Richman. She was, I would say, extremely bright, but
never went to college. It would have been unusual in that period. And the
young adulthood of my parents and also their siblings, unfortunately, took
place in the Depression. And being a first-generation immigrant family, they
went through very hard times. The ones who could find jobs all went to
work. My aunt started working full-time when she was thirteen. [00:10:02]
They all had to work to support the family. So that’s basically my mother’s
story.
My father was an orphan. He was raised in an orphanage in New

14

York State because apparently no one in his family could afford to take in
another child. He never had any Jewish education, so he was really different
from the other men in the family. But he was very soft-spoken, very funny.
He had a sense of humor. He worked for a sporting goods company. He
was quite artistic, and he ran a shop.
[00:11:00] In those days, you couldn’t print out your signs [laughs] or
anything. He ran what they called a sign shop and he made silkscreens. He
did that for his whole life. He was also a photographer, and he was really
good. Before he was married, he lived in Harlem; it was the period they
called the Harlem Renaissance. We have some fun photographs of his that I
should dig out sometime and put together.
But we lived in Brooklyn. I grew up in an apartment with my parents.
They worked. They were all good at math, so they would get jobs keeping
the books for companies or whatever, but they always worked.
[00:12:03] They were very industrious. They were typical, I think, of
immigrant families except they never had a family member who achieved a
real success in this country. I think that was partially because they were so
close-knit as a family. Their focus was more on each other and doing things
together, being together. So then no one ever became a successful
American. But they were very hardworking people their entire lives, all of
my aunts and uncles and parents. And they were actually very proud of the
fact that they never had one cent of assistance from anybody.
[00:13:00] So they weren’t scholars, but they were smart and they
understood what was going on in the world and had some interest in

15

politics. I think I grew up very differently from my parents in that school
was always the focus. When I got older, we moved to a different
neighborhood called Flatbush.
Flynn-Do: You mentioned that it really mattered to them to not depend on the system,
and that they were all very hard-working. Can you tell me anything more
about the values that you felt they instilled in you?
Bienenstock: [00:13:56] I think the main value was support of each other. They basically
took care of each other. They were hard workers. They believed in that. And
because of the times that they lived in, they were also savers. In other
words, they never lived extravagantly compared to what they earned. They
always saved.
[00:14:54] So actually, by the time the last family members died, they
were much more affluent than you would have thought [laughs] from the
way they lived, because they saved all their lives. They always lived in fear of
some cataclysm like the events in Russia, or the Depression. And they were
very, very aware–-in World War II--of events they had any knowledge of,
such as what was happening in Europe. I never found out until my aunt was
the last one alive that my grandfather’s mother and three sisters had never
come to the United States; they disappeared in the Holocaust. [00:16:03] I
did at one time go to the Holocaust Museum, and I think I was able to trace
two of them. But by the time I did that, they would have been gone anyway,
they would have been so old. But two were survivors.
Very early on, I started to have a liberal bias, besides my education in
the New York public schools. My family joined an organization called The

16

Workman’s Circle. That organization preserved Yiddish culture in several
ways. They had summer camps for children, which I attended. [00:17:15]
And you kind of got ingrained with ideas of social justice. You can tell from
the name, The Workman’s Circle, that they were very supportive of unions.
Even though it was summer camp, they taught us about the union
movement in the United States and the people who were associated with it.
It kind of turned you into a lifelong liberal. [laughs] And I think that’s where
I’ve stayed.
Flynn-Do: [00:17:57] You’ve talked about values, about social justice, and about the
American dream. Did you ever explicitly talk with your family about
education? Were you the first in your family to go to college?
Bienenstock: I was the only child in my family, which was also common in the
Depression period. Strangely, all of my friends were only children. I just
came back from a trip to New Orleans with two of my very old friends
from New York, and they were both only children.
Flynn-Do: Were there any other impacts of the Depression that you can notice in your
life, especially when you were growing up?
Bienenstock: Oh, I think this leaning towards thrift, always feeling you never know what’s
going to happen. You have to be prepared. I think that has stayed with me.
[00:19:06] But I think my teen years really formed a lot of what I did
in my later life. When I was first in high school, that was the beginning of a
time in New York City--it’s a little hard to understand that it was in New
York City--that was the revival of the American folk music tradition. It had
kind of faded and people were interested in jazz and pop and classical

17

music.
[00:19:54] But suddenly all these young people started trying to find
all the old folksongs, to revive them to teach other kids. There was a big
group in New York City, mostly focused in Greenwich Village and around
the Washington Square area. It was a gathering place for young people who
were interested in folk music. And even though I was never very musical, I
was a teenage girl and I was very interested in this. I got to know a lot of the
people that were involved, and became friends with some of them. And
they were, of course, mostly very liberal people. Woody Guthrie was still
alive at that time, although he was already ill. [00:20:58] But there were
people like Pete Seeger who hung around. He was already fairly well known,
but he used to sing with a group called the Jewish Young Folksingers. Mary
[Mary Travers], of Peter, Paul, and Mary, was one of them. I got to know a
lot of these people, and they tended to be quite idealistic.
Their music was very focused, not just on finding and reviving folk
songs, which was what the main part of the movement was about, but they
also tended to be very into social justice. And like all teenage girls, I became
friends with a young musician. he was actually one of the people who in the
Civil Rights Movement, went down south and taught people how to sing,
“We Shall Overcome,” which was an old song, with different words.
[00:22:15] It was a very interesting time in my life. I was also studying
dance. I was interested in becoming a dancer before I learned that I could
do chemistry. [laughs] There were a lot of people around those circles, and
concerts all the time.

18

New York was just in ferment, which it probably still is, although I
haven’t lived there for a long time. [00:23:01] It had so many communities,
people who were interested in different things, and who could gather
enough people to start organizing and make their ideas very available and
open to people. At that time, in 1948, Israel had become a state. And a lot
of people started coming--particularly to centers where there were
tremendous Jewish communities--to try to populate Israel, to interest
idealistic young people, in living on the communal farms, the kibbutzim.
They were recruiting people to come to build them and live on them, and
basically to build a country.
[00:24:12] One night I went with a friend, who was very interested in
the Zionist movement, to a meeting in Manhattan, where there were lots of
teenagers who were also very interested. They would do things like read
philosophers and report to each other. [laughs] They were not typical
American teenagers, they had a very intellectual bent. They wrote their own
little magazine or newsletter. And they did a lot of dancing. There were
quite a few kids, maybe twenty or twenty-five. [00:25:02] There was a young
man that I saw, and nothing happened. But a few weeks later, I went with
my best friend to the ballet at City Center, and he was there, and he spoke
to me. I was seventeen years old, and he was eighteen. And we’ve been
together ever since then. [laughs]
Flynn-Do: Wow.
Bienenstock: Yes. We just had our fifty-ninth anniversary.
Flynn-Do: Congratulations.

19

Bienenstock: Thank you.
Flynn-Do: These groups that you were involved in, were they explicitly connected, or
your husband, was he involved in other separate groups?
Bienenstock: The groups that I hung around with were in Manhattan, not in Brooklyn.
My friend Anita and I would spend a lot of time taking the subway and
going to the Village and hanging around there. [00:26:11] There were even
coffee shops. We spent a lot of time with groups of young musicians. That
was a very good time. We had a lot of fun. I went to a surprisingly good
high school in Brooklyn called Erasmus Hall, which is actually the oldest
public high school in the United States, started by the original New York
Dutch settlers.
[00:27:00] It was a boys’ academy turned into a high school. And one
of the benefits, the very few benefits, of the Depression was that a lot of
people in New York pursued education and got advanced degrees, but since
there were no jobs, they ended up teaching in the high schools. Some of my
teachers in high school were PhDs in their fields, and they made it very
interesting. I don’t remember school really well because it wasn’t the focus
of my social life. I never belonged to all of the high school clubs or
activities. I was much more interested in taking off and going to Manhattan
and taking dance classes and listening to music.[00:28:10] My social life was
not focused on high school, so I think I probably missed some things, but
really I consider there was a tremendous benefit of living in a place like New
York.
So when I was a seventeen, I met Artie [Arthur Bienenstock] and we

20

got married when we were very young. I was a junior in college. Since I
never wanted to leave New York, and by the time I was a junior in high
school I had met Artie, and he was going to school in New York, [00:28:57]
I decided to stay and go to Brooklyn College. I was a good student and
could have had a choice of schools, but I chose New York.
Flynn-Do: What was your experience at Brooklyn College like?
Bienenstock: It was basically a good experience. Once again, my focus wasn’t on the
school. It was on Artie and our social life. When I first met Artie, he was
still living in the Bronx with his parents. [00:30:01] And I was living in
Brooklyn with my parents. Those are quite far apart. But he was going to
school in Brooklyn, so he was a commuter on the subway and spent a lot of
time at school. Right from the beginning, we started spending a lot of time
together. It didn’t take the people around Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute
long to recognize that Artie was a very capable student, and they offered
him opportunities.
We became very good friends with his professor, who also lived in
Brooklyn near us and had a family. I was never focused on the college life,
just like I was never focused on the high school life.
[00:31:06] The only activities I remember were being in the dance
club, modern dance, and we put on some performances. I was also in the
chemistry society. I was always a good student. I was good at math and I
was good at the science courses, and I realized that’s what I would study.
[00:31:56] I had some interesting experiences that the members of
the women’s movement [laughs] probably would know all about. I could

21

never get a summer job because they didn’t think women could work in
chemistry, they thought I ought to learn to type. So I never learned to type.
Artie had to type my papers. [laughs] I remember an organic chemistry
course where there were primarily students who had the same social
background I had. Most of the kids that I went to school with at Brooklyn
College were the first members of their families to go to college, as I was.
They were very ambitious, very competitive, and a couple of young men
asked me if I’d go outside during break with them. And they said, “We have
to get into medical school and you don’t. And you’re ruining our curve.”
[laughs] This is the truth. “Would you mind not getting such good grades to
help us?” So, of course, I ignored them, but that was the kind of thing that
could easily happen in those days.
[00:34:01] Anyway, Artie and I decided to get married, which we did.
I was still an undergraduate. I was a junior. We moved to Cambridge and
Artie’s professor--I don’t know if you know anything about physics--but
Artie’s professor--as with several of the other professors at Brooklyn
Polytechnic Institute--was a German immigrant escaping the Nazis during
World War II. He was not Jewish, but his wife was. His son-in-law was a
Nobel laureate, Hans Bethe, at Cornell.
[00:34:59] He realized that Artie did not belong where there and had
to move on, and wanted him to go to Cornell to work with Hans Bethe. But
since we were getting married, we had to go someplace together. It was a
modern dilemma to have to find places in the same city.
So we applied to Cornell. And since I was already a junior and would

22

just be there for my senior year, I didn’t get in. They wouldn’t take a student
for that short a time. The only place I got into was MIT because by that
time, I was a pretty good science student, and they had a special category.
Artie decided that since he’d been in an engineering school, he wanted to go
to a different kind of college, so he went to Harvard.
[00:35:59] Our lives changed a lot. All of a sudden we were these two
young kids who had gotten married probably much younger than we should
have. I lived with my parents till the day I was married. Then I lived with
Artie. Artie had moved away from his parents, he had a little apartment.
Flynn-Do: And was that apartment in New York or was that when you moved to
Cambridge?
Bienenstock: New York.
Flynn-Do: What was it like moving to Cambridge and changing your whole life in a
different city without your family?
Bienenstock: It was a big change. I had never been responsible for providing meals or
shopping or housekeeping, and Artie had not either. I’d say it was a very,
very difficult couple of years for both of us, a really major adjustment.
Brooklyn College was not the biggest of the New York colleges--I think
now it’s all consolidated into the New York State University. But it was big.
MIT was a different kind of place.
First of all, they had a total in the entire school of two hundred
women. Women were not allowed to teach classes, which is a fact and
which very few people will believe when I tell them. It was not yet what it is
today, which is about 40 percent women. [00:38:02] And it has had a

23

women president. It wasn’t a really happy place for women then. They were
not really fully accepted. They had some women graduate students. There
were certainly women around, but absolutely you would not have a woman
teaching a class, or even a lab. It was very different from what it is now.
Flynn-Do: Can you compare your experiences at MIT to your experiences at Brooklyn
College, especially thinking of the men in your classes at Brooklyn College
who asked you to not mess up the curve?
Bienenstock: [00:39:01] Well, I think the men at MIT had more self-confidence. They
were not less competitive. Before the internet and computers, if there were
special books, they would be on reserve. They would hide them [laughs] so
nobody else could find them. They were competitive. And they were
successful. They had self-assurance and they just knew they were going
places. I think the people in Brooklyn College wanted to go places, but they
had more of a struggle to get there.
[00:39:57] The classes were mostly very good. Probably the average
student at MIT was at a higher level than the average student at Brooklyn
College. But they weren’t in a different universe. It was a rough experience
for me, not just because of the big change in the school. MIT was actually
more supportive in terms of having people available that you could go to for
help with your program or whatever. They were obviously better off
financially.
[00:40:57] So you could get more help and more support if you
wanted it. But it was just a general kind of culture shock and adjusting to a
marriage between two very young, immature, but complicated people, with a

24

lot of ideas and ambition. So, yes, I would say it was a rough year. And the
next year was also, because I went into a graduate program at Brandeis. That
was somewhat different because they were a department--the biochemistry
department--of people I would say who were social liberals. They really
wanted women, and they made an effort. [00:42:01] They were very kind.
The courses did not have just a single professor; every topic was covered by
different people. It was a teaching method that was new to me. Every
lecture was complete in itself--well, someone might teach two or three of
them. But there were specific topics, and the labs were like that. You just
got assigned to someone and got a problem to work on and you were kind
of on your own. But I give them a lot of credit for being very socially aware
and very much wanting to make it a department where women were equal.
[00:43:08] That was a very interesting experience. But at that time,
given the complexities in our lives--Artie and I were really not doing very
well and going through a lot of emotional turmoil--I decided to leave
Brandeis, which I would say was the big mistake I’ve made in my life. The
department head assured me I would have a professorship and my own lab,
that I was really good and I should stay. But I was at a point in my life when
I wanted to make a choice, to make our marriage work, and to make our
lives together work.
[00:44:01] So I made what I consider in retrospect probably was a
bad decision. Not that I’ve had a bad life. [laughs]
Flynn-Do: Can you tell me a little bit more about what you were studying at the
different universities, and if that shifted at all?

25

Bienenstock: No, I was always studying chemistry and biochemistry. My favorite course at
MIT was a philosophy course. I really liked the humanities. I considered
switching my major, but never did.
Flynn-Do: After you left the PhD program at Brandeis, what did you do?
Bienenstock: I worked at Tufts Medical School for a while doing virology, which was
interesting. Tissue culture was not brand new, but a newish technique at that
time. We grew various viruses.
Flynn-Do: [00:46:06] How long were you at Tufts?
Bienenstock: Maybe two years. Then I became pregnant and towards the end of my
pregnancy, I stopped working. We were still living in Cambridge and Artie
was still in graduate school when Eric was born, our oldest son. I stayed
home and took care of him. When Artie finished his PhD, they told him if
he left, which they arranged, for a year and did a post doc, then he could
come back to Harvard and be on the faculty. So we went to England for a
year. Eric was about a year and a half at the time we left.
Flynn-Do: What was being a mother like with different styles of support? When you
were in Cambridge, was your family able to help you? And when you moved
to England, obviously, it was very different.
Bienenstock: Well, they didn’t physically help me in Cambridge because they were in New
York. But they were always very supportive of us, even though they didn’t
really approve of where we lived.
[00:47:59] But they were a very supportive family. They had the oldfashioned value that family takes care of each other, sticks together, and
they were always there to help us if we needed help.

26

Flynn-Do: Does that mean they were invested in your education? You were talking
about their old traditional view--how did they feel about your being a
woman in STEM?
Bienenstock: I don’t think that was important to them at all. They weren’t positive about
it. They weren’t negative about it.
Flynn-Do: Tell me a little bit about your time in England, and then how that
transitioned to the rest of your life.
Bienenstock: That was another new culture. I came from the big city, and I had always
lived in cities. [00:48:59] In England we lived in a little village, picturesque,
beautiful. We lived in what had been sort of a manor house, Sutton
Courtenay House. It was not the main manor house, but it was a big house,
divided into flats.
I want to say one of the things that I haven’t talked about is the role
of other people--that was always a big factor in our lives. Right from the
time we left New York and went to Harvard, we were surrounded by really
interesting people from a variety of cultures. [00:49:56] And because they
were at the same point in their lives, we had a lot of good friends. I think
that was a very big influence in my life--coming from a big city, but a very
narrow culture, to being friends with someone from the Kellogg family, or
just very different kinds of people. You learn a lot. You learn about life
really, more from different people than from anything else, particularly
around a university. Living in a university is a real privilege because you
meet probably the most open-minded kinds of people in the world.
[00:51:04] They’re scholars, and they’re scholars because they’re

27

interested in everything. They have their main focus, but they’re interested
in learning. Like the Stanford Historical Society, why would they want to
know about me? Really? But they do because that’s the kind of people they
are. They have curiosity about other people’s experiences, and I guess
because we were a bright young couple with a lot of interests, they were
interested in us. This was true even in England, which was a different kind
of a situation, essentially a village.
[00:51:54] We were living in a house on the high street in the village,
and I asked someone where we could get a newspaper. I was told that a very
short distance away, there was a little shop that had groceries and small dry
good items, and you could get newspapers. So I went there and I asked if we
could subscribe to the newspaper, and they said, “Oh, yes.” I told them my
name and they said, “Okay, your paper will be there tomorrow.” I said,
“Don’t you want to know where we live?” And they said, “Oh, we know
where you live.” [laughs] So it was a very small community. Not everybody
was friendly and open, but most of the people, surprisingly, were.
[00:52:56] Artie was at Harwell, a big laboratory that was at that time
the atomic energy establishment. And so there were people living in the
village from Harwell. But it wasn’t quite as open as it is now with people
coming from all over the world every week. There were foreigners,
obviously. Artie was there, but the people were mostly British. I learned
about chilblains. There was no central heating. [laughs] You can look that
up. It’s the thing you get from standing in front of the fire so one side of
your legs is hot and the other side is cold.

28

[00:53:56] It was a great experience, even though Artie was working
very hard and I was home with Eric. There was a garden that was slightly
run down at that point, but it had been on the national garden register or
something, and it had topiary birds. It was a beautiful English garden, which
I’d certainly never had.
It was 1962, so not that many years since WWII had ended. They
were still recovering from the war. The value of the dollar was very high.
We were able to do a lot of things, like go the theater in London, quite
often. We were not far from Oxford, and could go to the theater in Oxford.
[00:55:04] We were able to really enjoy being there and take advantage of
what was there.
Flynn-Do: How did that play out with you being a young mother and your husband
doing his post doc work?
Bienenstock: It’s hard to remember. It was a long time ago. I think I was alone with Eric
quite a bit, and we had the privilege of being there before it was all
modernized. So, for example, we had pipes on the outside of the house that
froze in the winter and there was no water for a while.
[00:56:01] I made some friends who mostly had small children also. I
had a car, which gave me a lot of freedom. I would go to Oxford to go
shopping and drive around the countryside. I wouldn’t do it today. [laughs]
Changing sides of the road plus slowing down reflexes is not a good
combination. We had a little Volkswagen that my father gave us, and so I
had a lot of freedom. The market town was Abingdon, and I went to
Abingdon with Eric quite a bit.

29

[00:57:01] I wasn’t cooped up in the village. And this village had
some characters, which they usually do. We had a very good time there. And
there we’re enough people who were friendly. There was a women’s group
that had tea parties and things like that.
Flynn-Do: How long were you in England before you came back to the States?
Bienenstock: I think we were gone pretty much a year. The post doc ended, and Artie
went back to Harvard to teach.
Flynn-Do: While he was at Harvard teaching did you continue to be a stay-at-home
mom?
Bienenstock: I didn’t work. We had Eric, and then Amy was born when Eric was four.
We moved out to Lexington when Amy was born in 1964. Amy was born
with an illness called cystic fibrosis, which is genetic.
[00:59:03] It’s a recessive gene carried by both parents. Much more is
known about genetics today than was known at that time. She was
diagnosed when she was five months old, in Boston, at the Boston
Children’s Hospital. It is an illness that requires quite a lot of care. She was
sick more or less from the time she was born. It just took them a while to
figure out what it was.
At that time, they thought it would help their lungs if they were in an
environment with extremely high humidity. [01:00:08] So they would sleep
in these mist tents. They had a kind of mist-generating equipment called an
ultrasonic nebulizer, which is still around and that has some uses, but they
eventually cut out the mist tents. Amy required a certain kind of chest
physical therapy to keep the lungs clear. So from the time she was

30

diagnosed, she needed a lot of care and time. And, of course, that was not
easy on Eric. There was a lot of concern in my family and at that point, I
don’t remember if we had health insurance.
[01:01:00] When Eric was born, there was no health insurance, there
just wasn’t, that we knew of. You just paid the bills. I can’t remember at
what point we got insurance--whether it came with the job at Harvard or
whether it was somewhat later. But we didn’t have insurance for all this
equipment, which was at that time expensive, and both our families bought
it.
[01:01:57] We did get support from them. I don’t know what to say
about it. It was very difficult. Amy was a failure to thrive physically. She
lacked some digestive enzymes and they weren’t as good in those days at
replacing them. They’ve gotten much better at all these things over the
years. She was very small and very thin. I don’t know how many of these
various experiences over the years you want to hear about.
Flynn-Do: As many as you want to tell me.
Bienenstock: I think the worst experience we had involved Stanford. [laughs]
[01:03:01] When she was in kindergarten, she started to have these
terrible, terrible headaches before lunch time. She would come home and
she would be in so much pain and she couldn’t get up and go back to
school. This went on for some time before we realized there was a major
problem going on. So by the time she was in first grade, the doctor we had
recommended that I take her to--I don’t know what they called the clinic at
that time, it was child development.

31

Flynn-Do: At Stanford?
Bienenstock: Yes. And you can put this in your history because they deserve it.
Flynn-Do: [laughs]
Bienenstock: [01:03:58] They spent a few months going through an incredible number of
measurements, et cetera. And their final diagnosis was that her problem was
she had a school phobia and because I was such a kind of neurotic,
overbearing mother. That was the diagnosis. But she had been in nursery
school and then maybe until first grade with the twin sons of a young
woman who was a psychiatrist. I told her about this saying, “She has these
terrible headaches and she can’t get up out of bed, and she’s just a little girl.”
[01:05:01] This woman’s name was Barbara Almond; she died
recently. Her mother-in-law is one of the people who was very involved
with bringing childcare to Stanford [Dorothea Almond]. Barbara said, “I
know her well. If she says her head hurts, her head hurts. You have to find
another doctor.” So I did. I went back to our doctor and said, “We have to
see somebody else.” So we went to an ENT doctor who got an x-ray and
said, “If you had a cyst growing in your central sinus that was about that big,
you would have terrible headaches.” They removed it and she got better.
But I made an appointment to go back to Stanford and tell them.
[01:06:03] Can you imagine seeing a child who has terrible headaches?
First of all, I had said, “You know, these seem to me like they’re sinus
headaches.” And the doctor we saw at Stanford said, “Children that age
don’t have sinuses.” They saw her for I think it was a few months and they
never got an x-ray. That was not good medicine. I went back after the

32

surgery, and thought I’d give this doctor at least a chance to explain. I made
an appointment, but he didn’t come. So I proceeded to have a little tantrum,
and the head of pediatrics came and tried to calm me down. [laughs]
[01:06:57] I explained why I was so angry with them. He was a very
nice man and he did what he could to straighten it out. And we became
friends. By that time, I was working again, and he invited me to give one of
the seminars for his course at the med school, on nutrition. When Amy was
little, I had decided that I should put some of this technical background I
had to some use, and work with these kids. So I went to Foothill [College]
where they had a respiratory therapy program, and I got a degree to be a
respiratory therapist. I worked at Stanford Hospital when they were very
early in the game of heart transplants.
[01:08:01] They were just beginning to save these little premature
neonates by ventilating them, breathing for them. It was really interesting.
Then the doctor that we had been seeing, who ran the program at the
Children’s Hospital, asked me to come work there, so I did. I stayed there
for about seventeen years, from 1972 or 1973 to 1991.I was the chief
respiratory therapist for a number of years.
Flynn-Do: So this was a few years after you had come to Stanford in 1967?
Bienenstock: Yes. Amy was about six or seven, and we adopted another baby, our
younger son, Adam. Adam was born in 1969.
Flynn-Do: [01:09:59] How did your work as a respiratory therapist impact the way you
interacted with Amy and supported her and provided care at home?
Bienenstock: Well, I think Amy got very good care, very good doctors, and a very good

33

clinic. She got good care at home. I think it was hard on the other kids.
Three kids, and at that time the respiratory therapy program was more than
full-time, because you had to do internships in hospitals on the weekends. It
was hard on the family, but it was just something I wanted to do and I went
ahead and did it. I was never sorry. It was a job that met a lot of my needs,
and I think I was pretty good at it.
[01:11:08] I don’t know if everybody that I worked with would say
that, but I think I made it a good department with primary emphasis on
patient care, when it’s easy to get caught up in rules and regulations and
charges, and all kinds of committees, all sorts of other stuff. You need to
keep the focus on what your primary goals are. I did it for quite a while and
got to know a lot of these kids and a lot of the families.
[01:12:01] It was a good thing to do for a while. After Amy died, it
really got harder. She lived to be nineteen. And it did get harder to be with
all these kids. And then they built what is the current Lucille Packard
Children’s Hospital. And they were going to take on more services, more
transplant patients, and expand neonatology--much more intensive care than
we’d been doing. I decided at that point that I really didn’t want to get into
that kind of a place. I never moved to the new hospital.
[01:13:02] And now they’re building a newer, bigger, even more
technical children’s hospital.
Flynn-Do: But you stayed involved working with cystic fibrosis, right? You also
mentioned that you were involved in several nonprofit organizations.
Bienenstock: Yes. Let me think. I was for quite a while involved with the Cystic Fibrosis

34

Foundation, which I believe is one of the smartest, best run not-for-profits.
You don’t know about the not-for-profit world yet, but it’s a big one in this
country. Even in Santa Clara County, this one county, there are maybe 1100
not-for-profit organizations.
[01:14:08] And that particular foundation, at the time that I was the
president, was involved in one of the kinds of controversies that happen.
The people who founded and basically ran the board were very, very
focused on finding a cure for cystic fibrosis. That was their mission. Put the
money into research, find a cure, and get out of business. Of course, they’re
still at it. It’s a lot slower than you think. But they alienated a lot of people
who wanted local support services and meetings--and that’s a very close-knit
community.
[01:15:07] CF [cystic fibrosis] is what you call an orphan disease. The
people who have it are very sick and they suffer for a long time, but not
enough people have it to make it a strong interest of the pharmaceutical
companies. Diabetes affects about a million people or more in the US. CF
occurs one in sixteen hundred births, I think, in the Caucasian population.
It’s well known, but it’s not a common illness. Families want to have
support groups and summer camps for young adults, and all these kinds of
community activities. But the National Foundation just said, “send us the
money,” so we can put it into research programs and support clinics.
[01:16:00] So there was a conflict and a split, and a local organization
called Cystic Fibrosis Research Incorporated started. They do a lot of this
kind of social activity and they also raise money for research. Some of it

35

they’ve given to Stanford for many years. They fund smaller projects. They
do a lot of local activities in this community. They wouldn’t consider
themselves to be a rival organization because they have the same vision, but
in fact, they compete for funds. The national foundation, on the other hand,
has continued on its course, for which I give it credit.
[01:17:02] I think all these other things are very important in people’s
lives, but basically if you can find a cure I think that’s the way to go. Over
the years, they have raised very large sums of money and a couple of years
ago, they found a drug that actually stops the disease. It doesn’t cure
preexisting lung damage, and it only works for one genetic variant. It’s
turned out that CF is a disease that has many genetic variations. But they
have made a big step towards finding a cure.
[01:17:56] I stuck with the national foundation for a couple of years
and eventually found the politics with the local organization too difficult-they were my friends [laughs], too much personal conflict. Eventually,
because I was working in the respiratory field, I was asked to participate in
an organization that was, at that time, affiliated with the American Lung
Association. I became very active in that and eventually I became chair of
the board of the California Lung Association, and I was on their national
council. They do a lot of things in the field of respiratory illness.
[01:19:04] They’re mostly educational, but they do a big national
report every year on the state of the air. And they support a lot of asthma
and chronic lung disease programs and some research. I was associated with
that organization and also the local Santa Clara association, which I had

36

come through.
[01:19:52] Eventually there were some differences of opinion and
some of the local associations, like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Santa Clara,
split off and went back to being independent, local not-for-profit
organizations. I stayed on the local board. That’s what it is now. It’s a local
organization that does education programs. Then I got involved eventually
with the Women’s Club, which is very different.
Flynn-Do: This is the women’s club at Stanford, right?
Bienenstock: Stanford University Women’s Club founded by Mrs. David Starr Jordan,
wife of the first president. [01:21:00] This is the 120th anniversary.
Flynn-Do: Wow. I’d like to talk to you about the Stanford Women’s Club in the
context of Stanford. But before we move on, it seems like all of this started
when you became involved with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. When was
that?
Bienenstock: Oh, when Amy was a baby. We were going to Boston Children’s Hospital,
and they give you information about the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation because
it was supportive and had lots of information. Because of all this complex
and expensive equipment that they were using in those days, I think maybe
they were able to help some people financially.
The Stanford University Women’s Club is something totally different
from the kind of orientation I’ve had in the past. After I stopped working, I
did go back to school and got a Master of Public Health degree. Health
issues have been really a focus of my life, and particularly these kinds of
organizations that work in the area of trying to improve people’s lives

37

through educating them or having social programs for them or sponsoring
and funding research programs. They really have been a big part of my life.
[01:23:00] I went to San Jose State and got an MPH degree. It’s a very
interesting field. There are a lot of things I had never thought about--health
issues of homeless people, issues of the elderly. It’s very fascinating and
gave me more insight into what I was already doing. That and my children,
because Amy had always required a lot of care and it was always hard to feel
like the boys were getting everything they needed because she was always
focus of a great deal of attention.
[01:24:13] When she had these headache problems, they began to
think she might be slow and really not like school, and that might be behind
it. Of course, I knew she wasn’t the least bit slow--and when she was tested
it turned out her IQ was over 150; she was a really bright little girl and very
mathematically gifted. She became the center of attention of a lot of people
because here was this sick little girl who didn’t weigh anything, who could
do mathematics and always did really well in school.
[01:25:03] And she had very good adaptive skills instead of athletic.
She had a horse and was able to ride a horse. And she always made a lot of
friends, so she had a social life. I think the boys had a much harder time
growing up.
They didn’t have as easy a time in school, and they had a harder time
finding themselves. She eventually went to Stanford and was studying
chemical engineering and computer science, I think. Despite the fact that by
that time she was really, really sick, she did well and she had friends. She

38

died at the beginning of her sophomore year.
[01:26:08] Amy was always a big focus of everyone’s attention-certainly mine because I was working at the hospital and knew all these
other CF kids, and she had a lot of friends there. I was worried about Eric
and Adam because even though we tried, I think they had a harder time. She
just naturally attracted people and attention. And I was always very busy
with working and going to school and being in these organizations.
[01:27:00] We’ve had a pretty busy life. Artie has had a very busy,
active career at Stanford. He’s had a number of different positions, and he’s
been successful, but that is also a challenge for children. [laughs]
Flynn-Do: Can you talk more about your work/life balance, working at the hospital
and being a mother and all of these things?
Bienenstock: Well, I never saw myself as a superwoman. [laughs] I don’t know if I would
even say that I thought I did very well. I thought I was pulled in a lot of
different directions.
[01:27:57] There was a big focus in our family altogether on Arthur’s
career because he always had responsible positions. He always traveled a
great deal, which added a whole other kind of stress into the situation. To
be honest, I think I’m a pretty capable, organized person, or we wouldn’t
have survived without my being able to do that. But I think that there was
probably more stress than would be totally desirable. I think both our sons
had difficult teen years. They’ve both turned out to be perfectly fine people.
[01:29:00] But I think we did have very difficult times, and I think it
was related to trying to do so many things all at one time. Eric was born in

39

1960, and that whole period had a lot of change going on. There was just
lots of teen rebellion.
Flynn-Do: I’d really like to talk to you more about the context of the 1960s and the
1970s at Stanford. I’m going to make a note to talk about that next time. I
was hoping that you could tell me a little bit about your work experience in
comparison to other women at the time. [01:30:03] Did you feel like you
were an exception, or were there a lot of women who were trying to find
this work/life balance?
Bienenstock: Well, I worked in the hospital, so you have to remember that health care is
an environment with a lot of women. Women were not in any way unusual.
Most of the time I worked there, the director of the hospital was a man, but
when he retired, he was replaced by a woman. It’s a field where women have
been accepted more than in a lot of other fields. I think if I had wanted to
go to work at a company in Silicon Valley, it wouldn’t have been as open a
situation. Many of the doctors were women. Pediatrics is a field that a lot of
women are attracted to. [01:31:04] It was always an environment where
there were lots of women.
Flynn-Do: What about in the context of spouses of faculty? Did faculty wives tend to
work? Did they tend to be stay-at-home moms?
Bienenstock: If you interviewed the women in the women’s club, you would find a mix. I
think the majority were probably stay-at-home moms, and that went along
with the times that they lived in. Certainly there were quite a few who were
working and had professional jobs. So it’s a mix.
[01:31:58] But in groups like this you find women who are so

40

capable. You can see that if they went out into the working world, they
would be executives. They would be successful. But they’ve had different
kinds of lives. And I don’t think there are very many regrets in a group at
this particular socioeconomic level. In this particular kind of environment,
people have had very rich lives in terms of experiences and connections
with other people. The women’s club is very interesting because it has a
niche of providing friendship and activities for women more or less not
working.
[01:33:09] You could write a book about the SUWC as it fits into
American society. I’m sure at the beginning of the university, there would
probably have been some wives who were very educated or had some work
activity. But they would have been unusual. They were faculty wives. And
one of the reasons the club is historically important is that I think these
women had a big role in the university in terms of bringing people in, taking
them around, introducing them to the university.
[01:34:00] I couldn’t even count how many times I’ve taken people
on tours to see the campus or the university. But it’s an important part of
the introduction of someone to the campus life. It’s the way that, if they
come here, they’re going to live, and these are the people they’re probably
going to be with.
I think they’ve played a more important role than anyone ever credits
them with in building the university. Artie figured something out very early
when he was a young professor at Harvard, and he first needed to have an
assistant. And that was if you hired the wife of a graduate student, you got

41

somebody quite talented, a capable person who was very smart, could
handle the job, knew what to do.
[01:35:11] That may be a prejudice, but it generally works out.
[laughs] You know the old proverb, “Birds of a feather flock together,” so
gifted intellectuals don’t tend to partner with people they can’t talk to. These
women are smart, talented, and have played a historic role in the university,
which I don’t think has, of course, gotten any recognition.
Flynn-Do: Next time we’ll talk more about the women’s club at Stanford.
Bienenstock: [01:36:00] My life was in a very transitional period. I remember the bra
burnings and the beginning of the women’s lib movement and the rallies
and all this kind of thing. There were people who worked very hard to
accomplish things. It was kind of a joke in the newspapers, but it was
serious and they did a lot. You can see over the years how the role of
women has changed.
Flynn-Do: That’s was an exciting time and really interesting to be able to talk to you
about that transition. I do want to be mindful of your time, though.
Bienenstock: Yes, and yours. So why don’t we finish up here.
Flynn-Do: Yes. I was wondering if you had anything that for next time you especially
want to talk about. I personally would love to talk to you about the women’s
club.
[01:37:01] And next time we’ll focus mostly on your time at Stanford.
But was there anything that we only touched on or that we didn’t touch on
at all that you’d like to talk about next time?
Bienenstock: I’ll see if I think of something.

42

Flynn-Do: Yes. And feel free to shoot me an email if that is the case. Great. Well,
thank you so much.
Bienenstock: Thank you for listening.

STANFORD COMMUNITY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT

INTERVIEWER:

MEIKO FLYNN-DO

INTERVIEWEE:

ROSLYN BIENENSTOCK

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MAY 11, 2016

Flynn-Do: This is Meiko Flynn-Do with the Stanford Historical Society’s Oral History
Program. Today is May 11, 2016 and I’m here with Mrs. Roslyn
Bienenstock. We’re conducting a second session at her home as part of the
Stanford Community Oral History Project.
So Mrs. Bienenstock, when you first came to Stanford it was I believe
1967?
Bienenstock: Very good. [both laugh]
Flynn-Do: I’m glad that worked out. Can you tell me a little bit about your transition to
Stanford and what those first couple of months or years were like?
Bienenstock: [00:00:37] Well, I think we came at the end of the academic year. Artie
[Arthur Bienenstock] had been teaching at Harvard. We lived in Lexington
and it snowed in May, so it was a very pleasant transition. But it was
difficult. We had been there since 1957 and we had a lot of friends that we’d
made over the years so it was hard to leave. But it was a really good change
for both of us. The first thing noticeable, of course, was the climate, but
Palo Alto is a very pleasant place at any time of year. We immediately joined
the Stanford Campus Recreation Association, which was a very good place

45

for our children.
Flynn-Do: [00:01:57] How old were your children at this time?
Bienenstock: Oh, Amy was small. She was about three, so Eric was going into first grade.
Flynn-Do: When you first arrived, did anybody welcome you or tell you about support
systems here at Stanford?
Bienenstock: It was a very welcoming place. At that time--I don’t know if it still exists-there was a welcome wagon and someone who came to see you and brought
you all kinds of little presents and booklets of information. Artie was in a
department at Stanford; I think he came as an associate professor and
immediately had colleagues whom we met, so we never seemed to have any
problem getting into a social life. It’s pretty well established here. People are
very open and very friendly. And our kids made friends in the neighborhood
we were living in, and they liked it.
[00:03:22] They weren’t old enough to have a problem transitioning
from one school to another, one place to another. They liked it immediately
and we did, too. Stanford is pretty much a welcoming environment. I had
friends with teenage children who’d had a lot more trouble adjusting, but I
think it was more their age than anything else. They really missed their
friends and had trouble making friends in high school.
So it was a good place, and one of the main things we had come for
was the Cystic Fibrosis Center at the Children’s Hospital. We really needed
to be near a good medical center and among other things, Stanford has that,
so that made it sort of an ideal place for us.
Flynn-Do: [00:04:44] Right. You said last time that you had interacted with the medical

46

hospital not only as a mother but also working there. Can you tell me a little
bit about the interplay of those two roles, or if there were other roles that
you played or that you interacted with at the Stanford Hospital?
Bienenstock: Well, the Children’s Hospital and the Stanford Hospital were two separate
entities at that time. They were not joined the way they are now and have
been for the past several years. The Children’s Hospital existed where the
Vi, the retirement home, is now, and so we didn’t really go to Stanford
except for more extreme needs. I think at that time, we went to private
doctors; going to Stanford was for special needs.
But the Children’s Hospital always had a team approach to care. I
think they had a really, really good program even back when we came,
which was of course long after it was established. They had an excellent
program because they used a team approach. They had physicians, and
nurses, and social workers, and people who worked in that particular
service, and they got to know the children very well. It’s only more recently
that caring for adults with cystic fibrosis has become a real part of that
program. At that time, there were very few adults with that disease.
Flynn-Do: [00:07:13] You’ve talked briefly about your interactions with the hospital
and mentioned that there was an established social scene here at Stanford.
Were there other parts of the Stanford community that you were interacting
with? Did you talk with any part of the Jewish community on campus or any
other organizations?
Bienenstock: Yes. Immediately after we came, Artie was on the board of the Stanford
Hillel Association, so yes, we met the Jewish faculty. We met the Physics

47

faculty. We met the Materials Science faculty. We met the Applied Physics
faculty. We met a large number of people at the Linear Accelerator Center.
[00:08:12] I think we were very lucky. Artie always had very broad
interests, and it wasn’t very long after he came here that he became what
they called a University Fellow. The Fellows took on some administrative
responsibilities, but really they were learning how to be [leaders] in the
university. Within a couple of years, Artie became a vice provost for faculty
affairs--that was another circle of people with varied interests.
He reviewed all faculty appointments on their way up to the provost
and the president. One of his assignments was faculty affirmative action
officer. At that time, the whole concept of affirmative action was very new
and the administration was very supportive. The whole time that we’ve been
here, Stanford has had really excellent people in the administration and he
had a lot of support. He wrote the first faculty affirmative action program,
and it really did almost immediately change the roles of a number of women
who’d been research associates and lecturers. Some of them were very, very
prominent in their own fields but not given the kind of promotions they
should have had. A number of women were immediately promoted, and he
got very into the whole concept of affirmative action.
[00:10:48] My in-laws moved out here after we did. Artie’s parents
retired and they followed us here and lived around San Jose. My father-inlaw had taught in Harlem. Of course we both grew up in New York as
social liberals and Artie has his own story. He took affirmative action
seriously. Many schools hired a lot of minorities at the level of lecturers, so

48

when they calculated the numbers of minorities, they looked good, but in
reality, they weren’t promoting people. At Stanford, they did it mostly
differently, that is, they hired affirmative action faculty candidates and the
university invested significantly in this. They hired people who were tenuretrack, and a lot of the really prominent minority faculty at Stanford came
during that period.
Stanford had a clever philosophy that if they went after the best
people because other schools weren’t, they would get them [laughs] and they
did. They did it very well. They took it seriously. They put resources into
doing it and I think they had a pretty good outcome.
[00:13:02] That consumed a lot of thought, and talking, et cetera
within the first few years of the time that we were here. Then we decided
that we wanted another child. Because cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease and
both parents are carriers–it’s a recessive gene–we decided to adopt a child.
We adopted Adam, who was a very, very active young boy. Well, he was an
infant when we adopted him. So that kept me very busy, and Amy, of
course, always had health problems.
We were really lucky. On this street, there were a number of families
with boys that were all the same age. Some were even born the same week
as Adam. They always had a circle of friends. My older son, Eric, who lives
up in Washington state, is still best friends with the same kids he grew up
with, who lived right here. Anything you’re interested in, there are
knowledgeable people around who, surprisingly, will talk to you about it.
[Laughs] You can just learn so much being around the people who live here.

49

[00:15:30] One of the really nice benefits was the Stanford Campus
Recreation Association, which you probably bicycled past. It’s basically a
swimming and tennis club for people who are eligible to live on campus-faculty and a certain level of staff.
Flynn-Do: Did you family and the other families on this street spend a lot of time
there?
Bienenstock: Yes, lots. A young women who moved here within the past year or two and
has three young children told me she spends most of her spare time there
with her kids, so it’s still [the case]. They’re working very hard on
maintaining that kind of environment, that it’s a kind of social atmosphere.
And of course, they have good swimming coaches.
Flynn-Do: Yes, that sounds like a great environment for a family. Could we backtrack a
little bit, and talk more about the affirmative action cases? Did you and your
husband talked about that at home?
Bienenstock: [00:17:10] We did, quite a bit, a lot. We both really believed in it. We’re a
Jewish family, a lot older than you are, and at the time that Artie started
graduate school, we had come from the ferment of New York City. Harvard
had only recently dropped its quota on Jewish students and faculty, and they
were just really beginning to have significant numbers of Jewish faculty.
When we came to Stanford, to me, it always seemed like all the students
were blond. Of course, they weren’t all [laughs] but they were really the
dominant population. We’ve seen an enormous transition.
Artie’s had so many roles here over the years. He chaired the
Undergraduate Admissions Committee twice, and he did it in the period

50

where there was a lot of civil rights activity. He interacted a lot with the
Black Students Union, which he considered more middle class than he was,
[laughs] but they didn’t feel the same way about that. That was another
really interesting kind of experience.
[00:19:15] At one point during the Vietnam War protests, someone
started a fire or actually blew up the roof of the president’s office--those
buildings around the Main Quad have an internal second floor, and the
office just above the president’s was pretty seriously damaged. So they put
in a very heavy-duty sprinkler system and Artie was given that office. But at
that time, he smoked a pipe [laughs]. He would sit there and it would rain
on him. One time, my car got stuck on campus with all the kids in the car
and one of the campus police came along, and asked my name and when I
told him, he said, “Oh, I know your husband.”
For us, it’s always been a good place to live. I think it can be hard on
children because there are no ordinary role models. My sons were not the
greatest students, and there were absolutely no role models around of
working-class people, people who did ordinary day jobs, worked in
department stores, sold insurance, did manual jobs, nothing like that. All the
neighbors are professors. Everybody is very intellectual. Of course, there
was little league and soccer, and all that kind of thing. But basically if you’re
not a gifted student, you could really get the feeling that there are no options
for you because you don’t see anybody [laughs] who does ordinary things.
[00:21:49] That’s the only drawback I’ve ever felt about living on
campus, because the people are great. The whole environment, it’s well

51

cared for, it’s attractive, and it has more or less everything. The climate is
great. But if you don’t fit into that particular milieu, you can really have a
tough time. I think my sons had some very difficult times growing up.
Our daughter was the one who was very intellectually gifted. She
always felt she fit in fine, but she was the one who was really sick, who
never grew to a normal size. She had what they call “failure to thrive,” so
she was extremely short and thin. But she had a horse, and she had a whole
group of friends, and she was never lonely. And of course the environment
at the Children’s Hospital was remarkable in terms of their supporting these
kids.
[00:23:36] They even had a little Palo Alto school where the goal of
the teachers was to make sure the kids didn’t fall behind in school. They
weren’t teaching them new subjects, but they would get all their schoolwork
and work with them on it so they could go back to school and not have lost
[time]. Hospitalizations have gotten shorter, but they were long
hospitalizations then. The patients there almost all had what you would call
catastrophic illnesses, and they would have relatively long hospitalizations.
Two weeks would be more or less typical and mostly, then they could go
right back to school.
Flynn-Do: Can you tell me a little bit more about that community? Do you have any
stories that you feel would illustrate something about the Children’s
Hospital?
Bienenstock: I’ve got a million stories but I don’t know how much they would illustrate
the hospital. It was a very unique environment because it was small. I think

52

the number of inpatients was about sixty. On one side they had a little psych
unit and they had cancer patients, and the other side was more cystic
fibrosis and asthma. We had many severe asthmatics that practically lived
there. They were in and out and in and out. You don’t see that very much
anymore at all.
[00:25:52] I have some funny stories, and I think one thing that was
kind of unique was that people knew each other pretty well. Most of the
time that I worked there, I would go in the morning on the doctors’ rounds.
That’s kind of unusual that a respiratory therapist would be included in
medical rounds; I was also on some committees. I was on a committee with
Ann Arvin, who’s now the vice provost for research, and I got to know her
fairly well. It was a much smaller environment where even the staff
interacted in a way that’s a little different from a more structured one--not
that it was unstructured, everybody had their job, but there was a lot of
interaction between people at all levels.
[00:27:12] I don’t know how much you know about hospitals but
they tend to be pretty stratified and people’s places are set by their
credentials. Everybody who works in a hospital has a credential and it’s
pretty much hierarchical, but the Children’s Hospital was less that way and it
was very focused on the patients. I think it was in its time a great institution
for the patients.
Of course now, everything has gotten progressively more technical,
and people are very busy, and in hospitals, of necessity, there’s much more
oversight than there used to be, and much more focus on reimbursement et

53

cetera. So it’s very tight. For example, there are mandated nurse-to-patient
ratios and all this kind of thing. It was really a little more casual then. It
wasn’t a totally freeform environment, but it was a little bit looser than
things are now.
Flynn-Do: [00:28:50] You alluded to some of the stories you had. Will you tell me one
or two of them?
Bienenstock: I [laughs] don’t know if I want to record them. I’m going to tell you one
that I always remember--it’s kind of neutral [laughs]. I was going to see a
patient on one of the units, a very, very sick little girl with cystic fibrosis,
and I went into her room to look for her but I couldn’t find her. She wasn’t
there. So I went to the nursing station and said, “I can’t find this little girl.”
And the nurse sitting there said to me, “Oh, she’s very thin. You
should go back and look again.” [laughs]
Flynn-Do: Did you find her?
Bienenstock: No, of course not [both laugh].
Flynn-Do: [00:29:47] Where was she?
Bienenstock: She had gone off down the hall or to some therapy.
Flynn-Do: It sounds like a great place to work.
Bienenstock: Well, it could be a very sad place. A lot of the children, because of the
illnesses they had, died. And because it was so small and these patients came
back, and came back, and came back, you got to know the families very well.
You can ask anybody who works in the intensive care unit or that kind of
environment, how do you handle this kind of thing? You have to train
yourself to depersonalize it; you can’t share every one of these experiences

54

personally because you would be a basket case very quickly. And some
people were. There were people who knew they couldn’t work in that kind
of environment.
But it could be a very rewarding place because people had time to
really interact and get to know the patients and get to know the families,
which was in many ways a very positive aspect.
Flynn-Do: [00:31:29] How did that experience impact the way you thought about
Amy’s care and your family at home?
Bienenstock: It was very difficult initially. I really thought, “Why did I do this?” I thought
this would be a really useful thing to do, but it was very difficult. After a
while, it’s just a place where you work, but at the beginning it was quite
difficult and sad. And I think that impacted Eric and Adam, plus just the
fact that although respiratory therapy is not considered a high-level
academic program, it was actually very time consuming because it included a
lot of time working in the hospital to get experience.
So it was a hard thing to do. Sometimes I felt it was a rewarding
experience, other times I felt it was probably a mistake. But I became close
to a lot of the people that I worked with, and they were my friends and they
were supportive of me. Most of the time, I just liked it. It was an interesting
job. It had a lot of technical aspects to it. I ran the Pulmonary Function Lab
and we did all the EKGs [electrocardiograms]. In fact I used to say if it had
a plug, we took care of it [laughs]. It was ours, which of course is not the
case anymore.
Flynn-Do: [00:33:47] Would you say that your community at work was separate from k

55

the greater Stanford community academically?
Bienenstock: Yes, very. Remember, the Children’s Hospital was not part of Stanford at
that time.
Flynn-Do: What was it called at that time?
Bienenstock: When it was first started, it was the Children’s Convalescent Home. When I
started there, it was the Children’s Hospital at Stanford. David and Lucile
Packard--Mr. Packard was of course one of the two founders of Hewlett
Packard--were both students at Stanford who met when they both were
volunteers at the Convalescent Home. It was on the site of the Stanfords’
original home. I think when the Convalescent Home first started, they
might have had some part of the original building, but I think they had
some separate buildings. Then they built the Children’s Hospital at Stanford,
which no longer exists. It was a one-story building, and I don’t know how
old it was when I was there but it certainly wasn’t new.
[00:35:30] And then towards the end of the time that I was working,
they built the new hospital, the existing Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital.
By that time, both the Packards had died. Throughout the time that they
were married, they were big supporters of the Children’s Hospital, and then
they gave a major gift, or the foundation did, in Lucile Packard’s memory,
and that’s the Packard Children’s Hospital. So that’s the existing version,
and now they’re getting a new hospital.
When they built the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford
[1991], that’s when Stanford Medical School and pediatrics and the hospital
were consolidated, and it became part of Stanford, which it is now, It’s very

56

much affiliated with the Medical School, the Department of Pediatrics. They
do a lot more kinds of procedures than they used to. They do transplants
and they use all kinds of modern techniques with neonates. It keeps
becoming more and more technical and bigger.
Flynn-Do: [00:37:17] You’ve talked about your work there as being very time
consuming but very rewarding. How did that work with your husband’s
career and your kids all being in school? What was that kind of balance like?
Bienenstock: It took a lot of running around, driving kids around, getting up early, going
to bed late. And Amy, of course, she was ill. She needed chest physiotherapy
twice a day. It was, I would say, very busy, and we always had a fairly active
social life. Artie is a scientist, so he was traveling a lot of the time. He went
to meetings and traveled. I could not handle that kind of a schedule these
days, [laughs] but I guess we were both energetic, and organized, and very
busy.
Flynn-Do: [00:38:34] Since your husband was away a lot, were you taking more of the
home role?
Bienenstock: I think Artie was always more focused on his career than I was. He’s very,
very focused on his work. I was less so, more focused on the kids. I don’t
know. It’s like all the families I see around me now. We may have done it a
little bit earlier [laughs] than some other people but it was basically the way
people live now. You organize your time. You know where you’re going to
go every day, and where you’re going to be at what time, and who has a
lesson here, and who has a class there, and you just keep moving, and then
they grow up.

57

Flynn-Do: Did you feel that you were supporting his career, and if so, how did that
play out?
Bienenstock: Well, I think to a certain extent, I’ve always supported [laughs] his career,
which will get you into the Women’s Club. It wasn’t anything that was
planned. It was just the way we lived. I always did all the cooking. Artie
doesn’t cook, but he does do dishes. I don’t even remember when I cleaned
the house myself. There are certain things you can’t do. We always ate out a
lot. My kids ate a lot of pizza [laughs], and hamburgers, and all that, growing
up. I think we just lived like people are living more commonly right now,
especially around here.
[00:41:23] You see how busy people are. It’s a very busy kind of life
and Artie was always very busy. He is someone who has a lot of interests.
He’s a good scientist. He’s very good at science policy. He’s very interested
in a lot of what I might call technical policy issues, such as how much time
professors spend on administrative roles when they have grants and indirect
cost issues. He spent a lot of time at it.
I think our kids, because of the environment that they lived in, always
had a lot of friends, and because when I grew up there was family around,
their friends were almost always welcome here. We had a lot of kids for
dinner a lot of the time. It’s just a way of life. You don’t think about it, at
least I didn’t think about how I was going to live.
We entertained a lot. Besides having our children, we very often had
dinner parties. I just took it for granted that I did the cooking. Artie did
most of the cleaning up. Sometimes we had caterers to do the cooking.

58

Sometimes the person who cleans for me would come and help. You don’t
think about that, “I have a plan for this” . . . maybe some people do.
[00:43:32] They say when you’re in college, if you can write things
down, your life plan, you’re much more likely to live it out than someone
who can’t do that [laughs]. But I never did that and I don’t think Artie did.
Our lives just happened. I think we had, like everybody here, some
incredibly good luck in the environments we were able to live in and the
kinds of people we were able to know. And we were never in a war. We
never suffered noticeably from prejudice. We were lucky people.
I think we also were very unfortunate and our daughter was very
unfortunate, and that had a very big impact on my sons. I don’t know that
we were the most close-knit family, but Adam, the younger boy, and Amy
were very close. He would go with her out to the Stanford barn almost
every afternoon where she rode, and it was all so much less organized in
those days. There was a Mexican family with several children living on the
property and they were caretakers; he [Adam] made friends with those
children, and had a lot of companionship.
But I think they [the Bienenstock children] suffered from the level of
busyness and all the stuff we were doing and all the people we always had
around. I don’t think they got as much attention as they should.
Flynn-Do: [00:45:46] Can you tell me a little bit more about the people that you had
around, and the dinner parties, and things like that where you would host
people?
Bienenstock: Well, Artie was director of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lab for

59

nineteen years and when you get to know Stanford a little better, you’ll
notice there’s a constant stream of visitors coming through, I mean
constant. There are always guests visiting the laboratories. And besides the
fact that Artie traveled a lot, I traveled with him quite often. We lived for a
year in England when Eric was two, so we have a circle of friends who are
all over the place, and sooner or later, they turn up, and visitors to the labs,
or delegations from China, or someplace. As the director of the lab we
entertained lots of them. And we’re talkers and social, so [laughs] it was not
a hard thing to do. I’d say in retrospect, we’ve had basically a good life, but
it does take the ability to organize.
Flynn-Do: [00:47:31] A lot of these social gatherings weren’t Stanford professors?
Bienenstock: Usually if you were having a group of people, you might have some visiting
people and one or two local people. Because of the many things that Artie
was into--administration early on, affirmative action, and going to the pool
and swimming, undergraduate admissions, all the different committees and
Hillel--he got to know people from all over the university.
[00:48:22] That’s a big difference between Harvard and Stanford.
That was the main difference, we found. At Harvard, people just live
wherever they live. Some people might live in Cambridge. We lived in
Cambridge for a few years. We lived out in Lexington. I have a very close
friend here. She lived in Newton, Belmont, all the towns around the
university or further out, like Lexington, where we bought a house, or even
further out than that. So people don’t live in a cluster.
At Stanford, I think at least fifty percent of the faculty has lived on

60

some part of the campus, for all the time we’ve been here. And because
housing is so incredibly overpriced and hard to find, Stanford keeps
building more. They’re building more housing now on California Avenue.
So you get to know people from all over the university and become friends
with them. Not all of our friends are in the sciences. Many of them are in
the humanities.
Bienenstock: [00:51:19] I just spent about an hour before you came on the telephone.
This is not related to the Women’s Club. It’s this other organization that
I’ve been on the board of for many, many years and we’re having a crisis,
which will also happen to you [both laugh] if you get involved with any of
these things.
Flynn-Do: You mentioned this before, but can you tell me a little bit more about the
Stanford Women’s Club and how you first got involved?
Bienenstock: Well, I’m kind of a Johnny come lately [laughs] to the Women’s Club. I
might have joined once or twice but I never really participated until after I
stopped working. Then I just slowly got more involved. Do you know how
the club is organized? It’s all women. It was founded by the wife of
Stanford’s first president, David Starr Jordan. I don’t even know her first
name [Editor’s note: Jessie Knight Jordan]. We don’t have a good written
history, so I can’t tell you how much it’s changed over the years, but I’m
going to guess it probably hasn’t changed too much.
[00:53:21] It’s a club; it’s not a charity or a not-for-profit
organization. If you’re interested, I can tell you the difference between
those, but this is a club, which means it doesn’t have state laws that tell it

61

what to do. We run the meetings more or less by Robert’s Rules of Order. It
has a board and like most boards, the board grows by recommendations
from members or brings in people with skills that are needed. For example,
it’s only in recent years that we really need someone with computer skills to
be able to post a newsletter online.
The structure is very traditional. We have sections that are based on
the interests of the members. We have, for example, one section that meets
and speaks German to each other, one that speaks French, and the French
one has another group that reads books in French. There’s a “stitch and
chat” where people bring whatever handicrafts they’re working on and they
socialize. There’s a cuisine group where once a month the members choose
some ethnic cuisine--this month, it was Indian--and the members cook a
lunch and the group shares it. I go to that section. There’s an author’s
coffee, which doesn’t meet on a regular basis, but when it does meet, it will
have a guest speaker, almost always a local author, and there are many
authors in this area. There’s also a book club. All of these groups are part of
the Women’s Club.
[00:55:50] They run themselves. So for example the book club will
meet in the summer and whoever wants to come brings a lunch and they go
over a list of recommended books, all suggested by members, to choose the
books they’re going to read for the year. The cuisine group chooses what it’s
going to do. There’s currently a group called Chop Chop, which is also
around food, but they might go, for instance, to Draeger’s and a chef will
give a demonstration. Sometimes all of them participate in cooking certain

62

recipes. They’re focused on food but they don’t have potluck lunches or
anything like that.
If someone wants to start a new section and they can find some other
people who want to meet, the only rule really is that your meeting can’t
conflict with other meetings. So it’s all run by the members. The only
money that we raise is our dues. In recent years where things have gotten a
little more expensive, we ask if people want to contribute something
additional. We don’t get many big contributions but someone might give an
extra twenty-five dollars or something like that. So really our entire budget is
mainly dues.
[00:57:45] There’s nothing stopping us from having a section that
does a charitable activity, and I would be very surprised if they hadn’t had
that in the past. We tried it but it was hard because the people who were
trying to do it also worked; this is a current problem. So we have our
sections based on the interest of the club members and any member can
start a section, if they can find other people interested. We also have
programs from time to time, not like once a month. They might be, but they
take place as they can be organized. These might have a speaker or very
occasionally, very occasionally, we might do something off the campus, but
generally you find a space on campus and someone speaks.
We had one of the flight nurses this year, and we had someone talk
about the political campaigns, so just interesting topics that people would be
interested in hearing about. There’s an art appreciation section and they
sometimes talk about artists. This year, someone introduced coloring, which

63

is very popular now. So lots of activities, all social, and at the end of the
year, we usually have some money left in our budget and we vote on where
to give the money, but it’s almost always to the library. We give them a
couple of hundred dollars for books or as a memorial. We have a have a lot
of older members.
[01:00:09] This is the current situation. We have been successful in
getting some younger members. The general age of our membership is
getting up there in years. We are trying to attract younger women, which we
can do with a little bit of success. I don’t consider this a problem, because I
think it’s a good thing, but most of the faculty wives these days are career
professionals and they don’t do social activities in the middle of the day.
Our other problem is that campus parking has become so crowded
that people won’t go to anything even if you can get a space for a speaker or
whatever on campus--that’s also getting very, very difficult. People will not
try to park on campus in the daytime, so we schedule for about four o’clock,
which is when parking enforcement ends and employees start to leave work
so some parking becomes available.
[01:01:49] We have a spring afternoon tea. Usually, the president’s
wife hosts the first event of the year. That’s up in the air at this time because
the new president has not taken office yet. And sometimes the president’s
wife is a career professional, like Gerhard Casper’s wife [Dr. Regina Casper]
was a psychiatrist in the Medical School and very busy. So we’ll see where
we’re going.
[01:03:14] One of the things that I personally consider to be a

64

problem is that we get very little recognition on campus. Most of the time, if
you talk about the Women’s Club, it’s like, “What’s that?” And it’s easy to
be dismissive of something that’s a women’s social activity. On the other
hand, I think as a club, it’s played a significant role in the university. When
the university was first founded and for many years, it would have been very
unusual for the faculty wives to have careers, so it played an important role
in their lives.
[01:04:17] I also believe that these older women have lived lifestyles
that are hard to sustain these days--some of them have had careers,
certainly. They’re almost all very educated. Oh, I forgot, music is a big
activity. We have a music section. The women are well read, and they play
an important role in the university. When I think about the number of
people I’ve taken on tours of the campus or had dinner parties for-networking is, as you probably already know, an important activity in
people’s lives, getting to know other people in the same field or other fields,
and finding mutual interests.
These are people you have relationships with your whole life, and
these women have largely facilitated that for the university. They helped
build their husband’s careers and certainly in the early days, most of them
would have dedicated themselves to their husband’s career and to their
children. Fitting in a job would not have been common.
They probably had a lot more charitable [activities]. Charities these
days are focused more on fundraising than actual physical activities [laughs].
I know the organization that I’m on the board of (Breathe California)

65

started out during the TB epidemics. They got people tested for tuberculosis
and supported treatment centers and all that kind of thing. I think there was
probably more of that sort of activity than there might be now. People
nowadays tend to write checks more.
[01:06:33] I think the Stanford University Women’s Club should have
more recognition by the university as having been part of the university’s
history. So I’m hoping (if I can get over this other little crisis that’s going
on--which I hope will end by next week)--to work on promoting more
awareness of it. People really take an idea and run with it around here, so
when the residential leaseholders have their annual meeting, we’re going to
have a table, with a banner, and there’s going to be something at the swim
club. We’re going try to promote the club more so that people recognize it.
[01:07:34] We recently had an event in someone’s beautiful garden,
and we got a surprisingly large number of young women. When we asked
them what attracted them, they said they all worked and it was very hard for
them to meet people. They came because they wanted to meet some people
that they could become friends with. And they did. They were talking
together and they had kids the same age.
So the club can still have a role. Women tend to be more social.
You’re not supposed to say anything about differences between the sexes;
they don’t exist anymore. But the fact is I think women tend to have more
need for companionship, and friendship, and support from other women,
and as an organization that’s what we do.
Flynn-Do: This is a little bit of a tangent but I think it would be interesting to talk to

66

you about, especially given my class with Professor Freedman [Estelle B.
Freedman] on Women in Modern America. Can you talk to me a bit about
the changing nature of gender roles in your life? You just said you feel that
women are more social by nature. What were some examples of women in
your life who showed you what it meant to be a woman?
Bienenstock: [01:09:21] That one’s tough for me, because I was a science student in a
time period where there were not a huge number of women in the sciences,
so I mostly went to school with men. I can remember as a teenager having a
group of friends in New York. I was never very close to my mother, but I
had a couple of friends who were very close to their mothers, really shared
everything that was going on in their lives. I found that very surprising. I
was an only child, my mother worked, and I was never very close to her. We
didn’t have that kind of sharing confidences relationship. I remember
learning about that from friends.
[01:10:54] By the time we got married, we immediately moved to
Cambridge. We had, again, a large circle of friends, but they were all more
or less in the same situation. Sometimes both the husband and wife were
graduate students, but much more frequently the husband was a graduate
student and the wife had a job. That was a common situation. So we were
not really hanging around having coffee. [laughs] I did make friends when I
had young children and I learned a lot from them because I had been very
much a loner, an only child who liked to read. My mother worked, so I
spent a lot of time alone reading books.
I never felt like I was missing out. I had aunts, and uncles, and family

67

who were around and close, but I didn’t have close relationships, besides my
grandmother. She was the only one I would say I was close to, and that was
when I was small. My best friend in high school was someone I was close
to, and I still am. I was with her in New Orleans last week, but she was also
kind of an unusual girl. She wasn’t very interested in school, although I was,
but we still managed to be friends.
[01:13:11] She was interested in music, and she introduced me to this
circle of musicians during the period of folk music revival. It was really
through her that I got to know a lot of these young musicians. We were not
close in the sense that we shared all our secrets and were going to be best
friends forever. We just weren’t like that. We were both only children. We
had both spent most of our childhood kind of entertaining ourselves, but
we’ve remained good friends.
So do you want to know who I would consider to be real role models
as women?
Flynn-Do: Or the ideas about womanhood that you feel might have impacted you
growing up.
Bienenstock: [01:14:32] Well, that, you just were surrounded by. When I first came to
Palo Alto, I made friends with a group of women. It was the Vietnam War,
and they were a little group who were very opposed to the Vietnam War.
We became very close to each other. There were about four of us, with very
young children. They liked folk music and marches. We went on antiwar
marches. I wouldn’t say they were hippies. They had a more middle-class
lifestyle--after all, they were living in Palo Alto.

68

But we used to just get together--do you know Kepler’s Books? The
father of the current Kepler was very antiwar and he used to come
sometimes and talk to us. It was not a woman’s bonding thing, but I think
we were pretty closely bonded together. We got up one time in the middle
of the night, and went up to Oakland. David Harris, who was Joan Baez’s
husband a little later, was burning his draft card; it was a very planned antiVietnam War action. We went up to watch this at the draft board in
Oakland. Joan Baez was there and a group of protesters decided to sit down
in the road, which was when she got arrested. I was with my friends and I
said, “Barbara, let’s go and sit in the road with Joan, and we’ll be arrested
with her.”
[01:17:04] She said, “You cannot do that. You have children.”
[laughs] So we packed up and went home.
Flynn-Do: Oh, my gosh.
Bienenstock: I’m still friends with at least one of them. I’ve known a lot of women, but I
think probably because I was alone so much growing up and I wasn’t really
close to my mother, that I never developed very intimate friendships with
women. I have a couple of people that I consider very close friends that I
talk with, but I’m really not a person who shares my personal life with
anybody. I’ll die with a lot of secrets. I’m just that kind of person who
doesn’t have the need to share everything that happens in my life with
someone else.
[01:18:32] I do and always have supported change for women. I saw
some very unhappy women at MIT. Women were not treated well in

69

general. I’m sure there are some women who have different memories than
I do, but women were not allowed to teach at MIT at that time. The male
fraternities and clubs used to put on plays that were spoofs, and they’d make
fun of the women students. I’m sure they wouldn’t dare do anything like
that today.
So it was a different time. I think some of the women there, who
were really brilliant or they would not have been there to begin with, had a
very hard time getting through that, but they did. When I was going to
school there, I had some male friends that I did labs with and that kind of
stuff. I never had a close woman friend there. I think my friend, Renée, who
we had dinner with last night, is probably the closest friend I’ve had here for
a long time.
[01:20:16] It always surprises me. I was never someone who would
turn my back on the women’s movement. I think they always did the right
thing and they’ve made incredible progress for women. People do not treat
women the way they used to. But despite all the progress and affirmative
action--I think Estelle Freedman actually knows Arthur a lot better than she
knows me [laughs] because I think she did work with him years back.
[01:21:19] I never personally played an active role in any group in the
women’s movement except for this group of friends that I had, but they
were in the antiwar movement. We did everything. We were in Mothers
Against--what did they call it? I don’t know, Mothers Against the [Vietnam
War]? Another Mother for Peace? We were just opposed to the Vietnam
War and always doing something around that. I’ve always had interest in

70

politics and I admire women. I’ve been a supporter of Hillary Clinton for
quite a few years now, and I really admire her. I admire women that stand
up for themselves, who know where their place is and it isn’t cleaning the
house.
I think in my personal life, I’m actually fairly liberated. I’ve always
been able to do pretty much what I wanted to do, but I’ve never been part
of what I would call the women’s lib movement.
Flynn-Do: Did you find that the women’s liberation movement was present at
Stanford? Did you experience it here?
Bienenstock: [01:23:01] Sure.
Flynn-Do: Can you talk about your experience of it at Stanford, with students, or with
the Women’s Club, anything like that?
Bienenstock: The Women’s Club is anything but women’s libbers. I think in order to
become what other people would recognize as an activist, you have to
experience a certain amount of discomfort in your life. If you’ve always
been in a very comfortable situation--you came from a comfortable family,
you went to good schools, you got married young, the typical pattern for my
generation and people that I knew--what would you be fighting against?
[01:24:06] I had a couple of experiences as a woman student. I think I
told you about some of the young men that I was taking a chemistry course
with asking me not to get grades that were too high to skew their curve, I
had a professor who told me I couldn’t get a job in the chemical field
because I was a woman and I should learn to type--so I didn’t, a very small
kind of rebellion. If there’s a quality that I’d say I did lack relative to the

71

ability that I had, it was ambition. I really wasn’t ambitious to have a career.
I was of my time--I wanted my kids, and I wanted my home, and my
husband, and it’s been the good life.
But I think women in the sciences who wanted more than I did had a
very tough time. A woman getting a professorship, that was not an easy
accomplishment. You couldn’t say, “Well, I have this good degree, and I
wrote these great papers, et cetera, et cetera.” You go lock step up the career
path. That didn’t happen to women.
[01:26:09] Now I’m 80 years old and I’m allowed to forget people’s
names, but there was a Nobel laureate here who did his work with his wife.
They did it together. He got the Nobel Prize and the professorship, and she
didn’t, until affirmative action came along. When they split up, they tried to
kick her out of her house. She wasn’t entitled, based on the level of her
position, to have ownership of a house on campus. Women had a hard time
getting recognition. I certainly have known a lot of women, seen a lot of
women, who have struggled in their lives much more than I did. If I wanted
what they wanted, which for some reason I didn’t, I would have had a much
harder time, too.
If you wanted a professorship at MIT, you could just forget it. When
we were at Harvard, women weren’t allowed in the front door of the Faculty
Club. People today just look at you. They’ve never heard of things like this
[laughs].
Flynn-Do: [01:28:03] And you were at Harvard in the 1960s?
Bienenstock: From 1957 to 1967. Well, I wasn’t, Artie was [laughs].

72

Flynn-Do: You talked about how women who wanted to pursue a career had a difficult
time, and also, kind of as a juxtaposition, that a lot of faculty wives didn’t
pursue careers. Did being a faculty wife impact the way that you thought
about your career, or thought about your family, or did it have any
implications for you?
Bienenstock: I think I would have felt the same no matter what Artie was doing. I don’t
think it was what he was doing. I think it was more the way I was [laughs],
which in retrospect, I would not brag about [laughs].
Flynn-Do: Do you think that there were expectations for other faculty wives, or did it
feel very normal for you to be a career woman and here at Stanford?
Bienenstock: By that time, that wasn’t unique at all. I think maybe what made it difficult
was having young children, and particularly having a child who was really
quite ill, so I did a lot of running around. I would call it more a job than a
career, but I don’t think it was any kind of rarity.
Flynn-Do: [01:30:19] We only have about twenty minutes left, and I wanted to give you
some space to talk about your Stanford experience in general, and also any
experiences that I haven’t thought to ask you about, Can we start with how
have you seen the Stanford community change in your time here, or how
has your involvement in the Stanford community changed?
Bienenstock: Well, the community has obviously changed. Women play a much larger
role in the university than they did when we first came. Minorities in general
play a much larger role in the university. As I said, when we first came, I
used to think everybody else was blond, but that’s changed markedly over
the years. I don’t know about the transition. It’s been a gradual process

73

because the university only has a certain number of faculty positions. It’s
gradually increased over time, but there had to be an open billet for a faculty
hire to occur. So it’s a slower transition than it might be someplace else, but
Stanford has been very, very good at being socially conscious and has
looked for diversity. There’s certainly been a big increase over the years.
[01:32:36] It’s too bad everybody can’t live here. Stanford in general
is a very open community. People tend to be very friendly. Of course,
Artie’s been an administrator in one way or another for many years, which
gives you a little bit of status. I think women have changed a lot, and I really
admire that. When I see young women in general, especially around here,
they are very self-assured. They have confidence in themselves. They’re not
afraid to express their ideas. In my generation, you see women who in a
sense play dumb; they’re really much smarter than they act. But young
women are different. They’re more upfront. They’re more willing to express
their thoughts, and they’re not afraid to go for it if they want something.
Of course, I can’t generalize about the whole population. I’m one of
those people who has lived either on the East Coast or the West Coast. I
don’t know the Midwest. Sometimes the way they vote there amazes me.
But women are not all the same. Women of my generation very often don’t
express their ideas. They won’t get into a confrontation.
Flynn-Do: [01:34:48] Do you feel similar to women of your generation in that regard?
Bienenstock: I think I’m more transitional. I’ve never done assertiveness training, but in
the environment that I grew up in, people were very liberal and outspoken
and confrontational, and that was acceptable behavior. I can never

74

remember being anything but a social liberal. I just grew up with those ideas.
Learning more about the world was horrifying. I could never understand
why people fought wars, why people would exclude others because of their
color--not that I was colorblind or that my family was colorblind. They
weren’t, but I couldn’t understand the idea of not accepting other people. I
was just raised in too much of a socially liberal kind of [way]. I think for a
woman my age, I can be assertive and confrontational at times. Ask Artie.
[both laugh]
Flynn-Do: You briefly mentioned the civil rights movement. Were you at all involved
in that?
Bienenstock: Very little. Well, in college, I used to go to--what did they call it? They
changed all the acronyms, the NAACP [National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People], or I guess it would be the Black Students
Association, or maybe they called themselves African American? I used to
go to some of their meetings. I always had some friends who were African
American. When I was in college, I very briefly had a boyfriend [who was
African American] and he was drafted, but my family went into total shock.
[01:38:07] I’ve been more supportive of civil rights, I did have this
folk singer boyfriend who knew We Shall Overcome and went down south
with two other people. One was a black folk singer--I think his name was
Bob Carey--and the other was Guy Carawan. The three of them actually are
the ones who taught the civil rights marchers that song. But that doesn’t
make me a civil rights activist.
Flynn-Do: That’s still a really cool story to hear. Just to loop back on a clarifying

75

question, you mentioned multiple boyfriends, but you met your husband
when you were very young.
Bienenstock: [01:38:59] Yes. I was seventeen when I met him, and yes, I was a little
precocious. [laughs]
Flynn-Do: And then you got married when you were a junior in college?
Bienenstock: Yes.
Flynn-Do: Okay. Let’s do one more overview question and then if there’s anything else
you wanted to share, we can go from there. Looking back at your life, have
you seen any important changes, things like your work in the antiwar
movement or even personal changes, becoming a mother, or getting
married, or graduating college?
Bienenstock: I’m quite different from the way I was when I was younger. I can still be
kind of a loner. I’m very happy to spend a day by myself and I often do, but
I think I used to be much more quiet. I don’t know if people would say I
was shy. I always had groups of friends. But I really was, I think, kind of
typical for an only child in that I like my own company and I don’t mind
when I’m alone. I don’t feel a compulsion to be with people. Sometimes I
really feel like I should make more of an effort to have more real friends,
women friends who call each other all the time and share their day-to-day
experiences, which I don’t do.
[01:41:08] But I think about a lot of things very differently from the
way I did when I was young. I just do. I am more outspoken than I would
have been. I do not see myself as a leader, so it amazes me when I get
elected to be president of these organizations. I don’t know what these

76

people are thinking. I really don’t. My own image of myself would be I’m
sort of a shy little girl, but I know for a fact I’m not.
I think I’ve changed a lot over the years. After all, I’ve known a lot of
academic superstars, you might say, and been close personal friends with a
number of them. I’m quite capable of communicating with them. I would
say there’s probably something of an inner conflict between my own view of
who I am, which is a little girl in Brooklyn, and the person that I really am.
[01:42:51] I had a friend who was actually a very well known voice
coach, and she came to see me at the hospital one time and said, “You are
one person who does not sound like who you are, and you should let me
coach you.”
Flynn-Do: I think that we talked about this in our preliminary interview but just so it’s
on the record, can you tell me some of the leadership positions you’ve held
in different organizations over the years?
Bienenstock: Maybe [both laugh]. Not a lot. Back when Amy was alive, I worked more
with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and I was president for Northern
California. I think I’ve mentioned all the ones I can remember. I was on the
board of a local association, which at that period was part of the American
Lung Association--the American Lung Association of Santa Clara County-and I was the president of that board for a couple of years.
[01:44:26] Then I was elected to the California board of the American
Lung Association, and I became chair of that board, which was very
interesting. It was a very large board with conflicts. It had groups on the
board from all the associations around the state and representation was

77

based on the population. There was a large group from Los Angeles and
most of their members were attorneys. We had some really conflicting
interests. It was a board with a lot of conflict, and to tell you the truth, I
liked it. [laughs] I guess it was my New York background. Ultimately,
unfortunately, it split up and I regret that. I’m still on the board of this same
local organization; now we’re called Breathe California.
[01:45:49] For a while, I was on the board of the Ronald McDonald
House. I was the head of the department I was in at the Children’s Hospital
for a number of years. At the hospital [laughs] you have to count people
differently because to fill ten jobs in the hospital, you have to have about
four times that many people covering three shifts a day, plus weekends, and
holidays. So we actually had twenty-some-odd people, but we didn’t have
that many people there at any given time. We ran the Pulmonary Function
Lab and the EKGs and respiratory therapy. It was really interesting to do,
and as I said, it had emotional ups and downs all the time.
That’s all [the leadership roles] I can remember right now. But I’ve
been in these organizations for so long. I’ve been on the same board for
almost thirty years.
Flynn-Do: [01:47:20] That’s all really great information. Thank you. I guess this is my
last question: are there any stories that you haven’t told or any issues we
haven’t talked about that you’d like to share?
Bienenstock: Aside from personal or family issues, which of course like everybody, we
have plenty of, I think the major issues in my life have been the things I
think about, not necessarily the things that I’m active in. I’m most active

78

with these organizations that work on fundraising or supporting research
projects all around the issues of respiratory illness, so that’s what I do. And
of course the Women’s Club, which I really support because I think it’s a
much more important kind of activity in women’s lives than people ever
think it is. I think in a way, that viewpoint is part of the social trivialization
of women, which I believe is unfair, so I’m active in that.
[01:49:03] Social issues have occupied my thinking. I never told you
that after I stopped working, I got a master’s degree in public health. That’s
very focused on multiculturalism, a lot of social issues, plus management.
People who get that degree end up running hospitals or elder living facilities.
So that’s really a fascinating field and I’m sorry that I didn’t spend more
time in it.
Flynn-Do: I would love to hear about it.
Bienenstock: I think public health is a very important field, really important. The number
of issues and problems that need attention in our society, and don’t get \
enough support, is just tremendous. Not that most of the world is better.
Most of the world is worse, but some of the European countries that have
built up very strong social support systems are better. Just learning about the
issues of homelessness and the health problems that these people have,
things that you can’t really imagine, you become, even if it’s only in your
own head, a kind of social activist.
[01:51:09] We do a little of that at Breathe California. There are
certain communities where people smoke a lot and there are some
communities where they’ve put these power stations, which is very unfair

79

because they pollute the air so badly. But public health, I think, is really
important, particularly as you can see the potential for mega epidemics that
wipe out large portions of the population increase as the world becomes
more global and international.
[01:51:57] If I were going to pick a field to work in these days, I
would probably pick something like that. I spent three years working at this.
I actually worked at the EPA for a while up in Berkeley, but I couldn’t
handle the commute, and then Artie got a job at the White House. He
worked in the Office of Science and Technology Policy and was the head of
the Science Division. That’s where this public health degree came in,
because Artie’s whole background is in physics and applied physics. I
actually taught him quite a bit, because that Office encompassed things like
agriculture. He had to go give a talk at the Department of Agriculture and
admit that the only time he’d ever seen corn growing was when we took a
trip across the country [laughs]. So I made good use of my degree but not in
the way they would have anticipated.
I could tell you loads and loads of stories. I’ve been around eighty
years now, so I have lots of experience. I would say for a child who grew up
in an immigrant family in Brooklyn, it’s been a very surprising life with all its
ups and downs. I’ve come over the years to really have a perspective on the
kind of privileges we’ve had in our lives.
Flynn-Do: [01:54:43] Thank you so much for sharing all of that with me. I really
appreciate it. If you have something else you wanted to add, I’d be happy to
listen, but I think we have a lot of really great stories.

80

Bienenstock: I hope you can make some use of it. I don’t see myself as somebody who’s
important at Stanford. I’m not, but Stanford is made up of a lot of people.
Flynn-Do: And I think hearing the stories of one of those people is very helpful for our
understanding of the university. So thank you, again, for being willing to do
this interview.
Bienenstock: [01:55:27] I know you’re going to have a great time in your career here, and
I’m sure you’ll do whatever you do very successfully.
Flynn-Do: [laughs] Thank you. I hope so.
