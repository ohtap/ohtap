Wise: I thought we’d start just very briefly, because we have factual materials about
where and when you were born.
Lyman: [00:01:23] Don’t worry.
Wise: I mean, well, just the basic facts we can include. But I wanted to touch on a
bit of your feelings about some of the facts and impressions. And so I would
just like to know generally how you would describe your childhood and
maybe to expand on that, in what ways did your upbringing influence who
you are today?
Lyman: [00:01:51] Oh, absolutely indelibly. I had a lot of freedom. I was the third of
three kids—two older boys who were my heroes. [00:02:07] At one point, my
parents were separated, and I was pretty much left to fend for myself,
although there were lots of able women in my vicinity who lived with us.
But I had a lot of time on my own. And we were out in the country, and I
made myself a nest in some vines and would retreat there. I had no
problems. It wasn’t until I was eight when we moved to Washington D.C.
when my parents—my father was the director of this small parents
cooperative school that they had started and my mother was a teacher. And
then in ‘33 we moved to Washington. And life took on quite a different
aspect.
Wise: I’ll bet.
Lyman: [00:03:28] We lived first out in Foxhall Village out northwest. At that point,
it was the only housing in the area. It was all a few mansions and public land,
12

which was interesting when you think what it looks like today. I went to the
local public school.
Wise: What was the name of that?
Lyman: [00:03:54] The Rose Lee Hardy School.
Wise: Oh, Hardy is still there.
Lyman: [00:03:57] It is still there. Yes. In fact my granddaughter played soccer on
their sports field. Isn’t that funny?
Wise: That’s great.
Lyman: [00:04:09] Then in the following year, my father went to the National Labor
Relations Board. He went to be Regional Director of the National Labor
Relations Board, Baltimore Region. For a year, we moved to Baltimore and
lived in what was then sort of semi-suburban Baltimore. Guilford, I think,
was the area. And I went, again, to the local public school. And I did okay.
And I hated it. My mother was then working in Washington. And we
decided to move back to Washington and live where my father could
commute every day to Baltimore, which was no big sweat. He loved it. We
moved to what was then across the street from the original Senate Office
Building on 1st Street. There was a row of little brick houses that were the
Federalist houses. And the inside of the block was the worst slum in
Washington at that point, the most notorious slum in Washington. It was
called Shots Alley for good and sufficient reason. We heard gunshots
almost—you know, regularly. I was strictly forbidden to walk through there.
But it was the most direct route home from school, and I walked through
there almost every afternoon. It profoundly influenced me because it was

13

tenement conditions. No running water, no electricity, and these African
American, then black, then Negro families living there in essential squalor
with the kids and the mangy dogs grabbing for food in the gutter outside the
houses. I mean that literally was the way it was. And, boy, I’ll tell you, it
made a huge impression on me. Plus, for the first time, starting when we
lived out at Reservoir Road [in Foxhall Village area], we had an absolutely
wonderful Negro housekeeper. Since my parents were both working, and
they were both away a lot, she was indispensable. The only trouble was we
took her to Baltimore with us and she was so lonely that she began to drink.
That was her undoing. And it was just heartbreaking to watch her
disintegrate, which she did. But she was a pillar. All three of us loved her.
The boys, of course, were home. Well, my older brother went off to the
Putney School —one of its first students in ’36 -- when we were just leaving
Reservoir Road. Then when we were in Baltimore, my younger older brother
went with one of the women who had been one of the directors of the
school that I’d mentioned—went around the world with her and her adopted
six-year-old son. He was then, I think, twelve, and one other boy—one
twelve-year-old. She took these kids around the world, literally, on freighters.
That was something else for him. My older brother has subsequently died.
But he’s still going strong and making trouble for everybody. He’s quite
amazing. That gives you some context -- there was an awful lot of
movement in the family environment. Plus, as I say, my parents were both
away a lot. So even when my mother and father got back together, which
they did while we were still up in Westchester County, they still sort of led

14

kind of separate lives. They were devoted to each other, and they stayed
together for the rest of their lives, but they also were very independent of
each other. And that was an interesting model.
Wise: I was just thinking that. Very interesting model.
Lyman: [00:09:32] That a woman could be independent. Not without discrimination,
believe me. But subsequently, when I’d made tapes of her—shortly before
she died, I made a couple of tapes with her, and she described what she was
doing with Rex Tugwell’s [Editor: Rexford G. Tugwell] Resettlement
Administration. She was working on employment issues for women and
Afri—and blacks—I mean Negroes. It was interesting how what goes
around comes around. It was all part of what was happening in my life [at
that time.] I remember driving with her one night to take Mrs. Howly, our
housekeeper, home, to her home. I had not seen her home, and she lived in
a tenement in another part of Washington. But it was definitely a tenement.
Wise: Similar to Shots Alley?
Lyman: [00:10:33] No. It was more stabilized than Shots Alley. It had electricity and
running water. But it was still a tenement. I can remember, and I don’t
know what possessed me to say to my mother, when I grow up, I’m going to
work for colored people, because it’s not fair they always have to work for
us. So it obviously was making a huge impact. Almost everything that
happened, the kinds of jobs my parents had were all related to equal
opportunity for somebody. In my father’s case, it was for the labor and
management, working out. And he was always very even-handed in his
dealings. Twenty-five years he was a regional director [of the National Labor

15

Relations Board]. Yet, his allegiance was entirely with labor. And the people
who came to our house were all labor—young labor organizers who had
another huge influence on me. They were my idols. Then for a while, we
had a bunch of young male and New Deal employees living with us one after
another. They were all baseball players, which made me a baseball fan early,
early on. Although they were all white, obviously. That was it. But then a
very interesting thing happened. We then moved over—the rats in our
house on 1st Street got to taking over, literally. When they began breaking
the china, my mother said, “Up with this I will not put any longer.” And we
moved over to a house that is still there, and it’s right behind the Supreme
Court on A Street where it abuts into the backside of the Supreme Court.
214 A Street. It was half of a double house. Our half was on an alley, and
across the alley was a coal yard. And every morning at five o’clock in the
morning, the coal trucks went out blahing as they went, backfiring right, left,
and center, which was not conducive to really good sleep. But there you are.
You got used to it. Interestingly, that house is still there, although the coal
yard is gone, and it’s all very middleclass now and fixed up. My two best
friends were a pair of twins who lived about a block and a half away. I don’t
know whether you—in your reading, you got the story about how we used to
roller skate on the Supreme Court terraces.
Wise: No.
Lyman: [00:14:06] The three of us. They were short and round, and I was this
beanpole. And we discovered that the Court Police would rescue us from
the Park Police when they threatened to throw us off the terraces. We would

16

retreat to the Court Police and they would let us go to the ladies room and
play in the ladies room. And I never will forget this. They had a green satin
chaise lounge in the ladies room and we would play Madame Recamier on
the satin. Anyway, we discovered in the course of things that the Chief
Justice came out of the court every afternoon about four o’clock with his
retinue and went around to the backside. He came out a side door and went
around to the back and got into his limousine on 1st Street which was
running right along the back of the court. This was 1st Street Northeast. We
decided it would be fun to say hello to him, the three of us. We were
standing there in with our roller skates and in our civvies, our play clothes,
and this Park policeman came up to us in jodhpurs with, you know, leather—
Wise: Boots or—
Lyman: [00:15:40] —boots—not boots, but chaps sort of things. You know, strap
on. He muscled up and he said, “What are you doing here?” We said,
“We’re just waiting to see the Chief Justice.” He said, “You can’t do that.
Go on. Scram.” Well, we were very incensed. I went home that night and I
was telling my parents about it at supper. My mother said, “Well, you know
what? Why don’t you write to the Chief Justice and tell him that you’re
Alfred [Ryder] Page’s granddaughter, and that you just wanted to say hello,
and that the Park police wouldn’t let you do that.” It turned out that my
grandfather was the person who proposed Hughes for the presidency to run
for the Republican Party in the caucus—of the Republican Caucus, and
they’d known each other quite well over the years. So I sat down and wrote
this letter. By return mail, I got—I hope it’s somewhere in the archives.

17

God knows what happened to it. But the most enchanting letter saying, “My
dear Elizabeth, of course, I’d love to see you some afternoon, and here is a
pass to show to anybody who tells you you shouldn’t be there, and here’s a
pass to the Court, and you can come in anytime you’d like. I’d be pleased to
have you.” Well, I called up my twins. We were beside ourselves with joy.
We got ourselves all spiffied-up in our best do, and we marched over the
next afternoon. As luck would have it, the same policeman was there. He
had just sort of elbowed up and said, “I thought I told you kids not to hang
around here.” Around the corner swept the Chief Justice. And here were
these two roly-poly little things, and here was this beanpole. They looked
identical. He walked right up to me and threw his arms around me and said,
“My Dear, I’m so glad to meet you. I was so devoted to your grandfather.”
I thought this policeman’s jaw would clank on the floor. It was just the most
marvelous come-uppance. He just sort of—well, I don’t know what
happened to him. He just sort of melted away.
Wise? [laughter] He wanted nothing more to do with that.
Lyman: [00:18:16] But it was such an absolutely gorgeous piece of come-uppance.
But it was not irrelevant to the kind of weird life we led, that it was a mixture
of very down-to-earth stuff, and the height of some of the politicos of the
time. I mean, we interacted with some of the movers and shakers. I worked
for a woman who had actually been one of the people who had lived with us
when we were out on Reservoir Road, and who had—poor woman—had
tried to keep my hair—I wore long hair and in braids, but I didn’t comb it.
There would be horrible tangles in it. And once a weekend, she would try to

18

straighten me out. She was one of the key people in putting together social
security, and a very important behind-the-scenes person.
Wise: So do you think you understood better sort of how to get things done
through this?
Lyman: [00:19:31] Of course. I actually worked for her. She moved into an
apartment up on Connecticut Avenue. I used to go up when she was giving
parties, which she did fairly often. I would go up and work as a passer. So I
met everybody. They all knew who I was. She would introduce me to
people. It wasn’t as though I was a servant. I was helping out. It was just
part of the whole ethos of what was happening in our lives at that point.
Both my parents were involved up to here.
Wise: So you’re probably a little less intimidated by political figures or people in
power.
Lyman: [00:20:24] And, of course, I was a confirmed Democrat and have remained
so. And fortunately, Dick [Richard Lyman] was converted by the U.S. Army
from a fairly liberally-minded Republican family to an ardent Democrat. And
he, too, has remained so.
Wise: Now, were there any people, like one or two, that particularly stand out to
you that influenced you?
Lyman: [00:20:53] In Washington?
Wise: Of all the people that you’re talking about through your childhood and in
Washington during this time that were particularly significant.
Lyman: [00:20:59] Well, one of the people—a weird guy by the name of Morris
Mitchell, who was a Virginia gentleman, went to NYU Graduate School, and

19

found himself in a cafeteria starting to eat his lunch at a cafeteria table, and
this person sat down opposite him and had black hands. He thought he was
going to throw up right then and there. I mean, it was just so unheard of for
him. He decided that he couldn’t do that, that he had to be there and just
take it in his stride. He became one of the most ardent desegregationists, and
worked—I mean he was—I’ve never known for sure. One of his brothers
was an avowed communist. I’ve never been sure about Morris. But he
certainly didn’t let it warp him, and he ended up working in education. But
he was working with my mother at that point in the Resettlement
Administration on desegregation and employment. He took me on a trip
through the South, through Virginia and North Carolina, and that’s where I
first met Mrs. Roosevelt. I inadvertently almost knocked her off the stage,
being a gawky—I think I was twelve, and all arms and legs and elbows. We
went to visit one of the projects, and she was dedicating the project.
Wise: Oh, wow.
Lyman: [00:23:19] I somehow was on the stage with her and stepped back and
bumped right into her, and literally, nearly knocked her off the stage. Well,
you can imagine that made something of an impression. God, I was ready to
die.
Wise: Right. [laughter] Absolutely.
Lyman: [00:23:39] Of course, she became the most incredible symbol for me. He
was fine, but she was the one. It was so interesting because as I went on in
various parts of my continuing to grow up, there were various women who
were hugely important. You ask who were the influential people. Helen

20

Ringe (pronounced Ringy) was one of them, the woman whose cocktail
parties I did. Then her boss’s daughter—Gordon Wagnet (pronounced
Wagonet) became my roommate at the Putney School when I went to the
Putney School. No. There’s a stage you have to know first, because in 1937,
when we were still living on A Street [in D.C.], my great aunt, my father’s
great aunt, he had—his grandma—his mother and two great aunts—two
aunts, and she was the younger one who had never married. She’s the one,
there are various stories about that, who had adopted [21] girl war orphans
and educated them.
Wise: Right. In Paris.
Lyman: [00:25:18] No, it wasn’t in Paris. They were actually out in two different
houses out in the countryside, or in small villages. In 1937, she came back to
the United States for the first time in some time. Her father had been a
railroad man, and she had enough money to live an extremely comfortable
life in an apartment in Paris, and access to a chauffeur and driver, and a
femme de chamber and cuisiniere. I mean all of the accoutrements, and set
up these two homes for these girls. If she’d lived in New York, she would
have lived on one of the avenues and that would have been it. But with the
exchange rate, she could do all these other things. I have no idea what her
sexual orientation was. All I know is that she never married, and that all her
friends were women. That was sort of the beginning of a lot of women in my
life. It wasn’t the beginning, but it was certainly reinforcing it. I think she
had said—when I was born—she adored my father, but she hated boys. My
father was the third of six boys. He was the last one that she took on a

21

Grand Tour. She took my two older uncles and then she took him. He was
the one who won her heart. So when I was born, as the only girl, she put
aside money for my education. And it was with—at least on the strength of
that money that she said, “I think she’s got to come [to Paris].” When she
came to see me, and I was this [twelve-year-old, tall, skinny, gawky] thing, she
was somewhat appalled, but rode with it.
Wise: For the record, let’s just say that you were tall.
Lyman: [00:27:37] I was tall. Yes. Excuse me. I was tall and skinny. I was close to
my current height, which—no. I was taller than my current height. I was
close to my ultimate height of five foot-ten, and I weighed ninety-four
pounds.
Wise: Oh, my goodness.
Lyman: [00:27:55] I was not anorexic. I mean, I just was skin and bones, and all
knees and elbows. She said to my parents, “If she’s going to learn to speak
French, she’s got to come now. There is going to be a war, and she’s got to
come.” So it was set up that I would go over in early ‘38, and I think it was
in June, and I went over. My father had just been changed from Regional
Director of the Baltimore Region to Regional Director of the Philadelphia
Region, which was a much bigger deal. It was a huge feather in his cap to get
that. We were just about to move, and my mother was going to work for the
Quakers, the American Friends Service Committee. But they took me up to
New York, and I joined a Putney [School summer] trip that was going to
Scandinavia, to Norway and Denmark, and Germany and Switzerland, and
then France, and all through France. But I left them when they got to Paris.

22

But that’s how I got there in this early summer of ‘38. Then Aunt Adine
who—I had grown three inches since she had seen me the year before, and I
was by that time my current height. She was thunderstruck. She just—but
she decided—and I was very tense. I mean it was a scary proposition, what
was happening.
Wise: Were you taller than other [women] in your family?
Lyman: [00:30:01] Oh, yes. Always. I mean I’d always been taller. I went whoooo
like this. I was five foot-ten and a half, and everybody else was five-five, or if
they were tall, or possibly five-six. And here was I. Just skin and bones. So
it was very disconcerting. Of course, my feet were like this. I had had foot
trouble, so I wore orthopedic shoes. God save me. I’ve always had these
gargantuan feet, never been able to buy pretty shoes, when they just didn’t
make pretty shoes for people with feet like mine. Then I had to wear these
damned orthopedic shoes, and it was awful. It was a penance. Here I was,
twelve—twelve and going on forty-seven, and six. I mean it was really a
mixed bag. And I had these skinny braids. She decided that the thing to do
for me was for me to live with one of the directors of one of the homes that
she’d had for her girls. When they all grew up and got married, she gave
them all little dowries. Then she gave the school buildings as homes to the
two directors. And I went down to Romorantin, which is not too far from
Blois just off the Loire, and [the town] was the home of Francois Premier’s
hunting lodge. She lived in a little cottage on this same property with the
school where the director lived in a little house that had double D’s on it like
this, over the sills that stood for Diane de Poitiers, who was the mistress of

23

Francois Premier. Here she was in this funny—the whole house was no
bigger than this part of our living room. It was tiny. It was [Aunt Adine’s]
retreat from Paris. It was also her way of coming down and checking on me
from time to time. I had French lessons every day, and the Madame, the
director, and her cohorts, who were her family members around her, were
convinced that I would never learn to speak French, that I was much too
tense and high-strung. I think they delighted in me, but they also thought—
ggssshhh—she’ll never make it. So then she decided the thing for me to do
was to go to this school [Préalpin] in Switzerland. She picked it out. It was
in a little village [Cherbres] up above Vevey at the other end of Lac Léman
from Geneva. [coughs] It was this incredible building—it had balconies each
floor, each room opened onto the balcony. They all looked out over the lake
and down to the Dents du Midi, those wonderful spiky mountains at the base
of Lac Léman at that end. The students were Germans, many of them Jews,
Eastern European Jews, Nazis, German and American. My first roommate
was an American—the daughter of an American Nazi from Milwaukee. I
finally wrote to my aunt and said I can’t stand this. I cannot live with this
woman, this girl.
Wise: How did the Jews and the Nazis get along?
Lyman: [00:34:42] Oh, well, [coughs] this was ‘38. Very bad. But there were eighty
girls, and there were a sprinkling of English girls in there, and they were the
ones—and a couple of other Americans, but one in particular who happened
to be the granddaughter of Frick—of Frick Gallery. [Editor: The Frick
Collection] She and I bonded, which was my salvation, because her mother

24

was around and once in a while they would take me out. [coughs] The other
thing that was my salvation was that Aunt Adine insisted that I go to the
Anglican church in Vevey every Sunday. So I would be bussed down to the
Anglican church and then I would have to wait for the bus to take me back
up to the school. I would go to the patisserie and buy these gorgeous things.
Meringues with chocolate, and so on. Uh.
Wise: Right. Put a little weight on those bones. [laughter]
Lyman: [00:35:56] Yes. Well, you know, for years I could eat anything, and did. I
mean anything. It was part of the sort of the strange ethos of this whole
experience. I finally got moved. I refused to stay with this Nazi any longer.
And I moved into a room with a Swiss --the first Swiss was a disaster--and a
Czech, whom I adored—a wonderful little roly-poly Czech girl—Jewish.
[coughs] That really didn’t mean anything to me very much at that point.
The first Swiss was a horror. She was the daughter of a much older woman
who didn’t know how to take care of her. She came with this great wicker
hamper, this huge thing, with all her clothes laid in layers. Between each
layer were sacks of garlic. Have you ever smelled what that smells like?
Wise: Oh, no.
Lyman: [00:37:20] And she was supposed to eat garlic because it was supposed to
keep the bugs away, and the only thing it did do was to keep everybody as far
from her as possible. She reeked of the smell of stale garlic. Every time she
opened this damn trunk, we would open the door and say, aagh. [laughter]
So that didn’t work very well. Then they gave us another Swiss [Vrenili
Schultess], [coughs] with whom I still keep up, and whose daughter stayed

25

with us at Hoover House. It was one of those magic [combinations]—the
Czech and the Swiss and me, we just had a hysterical time. Plus, my friend,
Louisa Lee (her grandfather was the founder of the Frick Collection), lived
down at the opposite end of my balcony. I don’t know how I did this in
retrospect. If you walked on the balcony, there were slats that squeaked.
Monsieur, the husband of the director, would come out on his balcony below
ours, which extended out, to smoke his cigar. So I couldn’t walk down there
on the slats. I tightroped along this wooden balcony down to the other end.
Then I would have a séance with who we called “Baby,” because she [Louisa
Lee] was baby-faced. Then I would tightrope back.
Wise: Tight-rope back. Wow.
Lyman: [00:39:09] We just had a lot of funny experiences. But I did learn to speak
French, because in my room, that was the only option. It was the only
common language we had. I was taking classes, and I was not dumb, and so
I learned. I never have learned to write the way I should have. When I was
in college and took French classes for literary courses, it was a pain in the
neck.
(misc.)
[00:40:05] But that was a hugely important influence. I then went back to
Paris in June with Annalise, my Czech roommate—she was going to Paris,
she hoped, to meet her parents who were supposedly flying out of
Czechoslovakia. I don’t know whatever happened to her.
Wise: Oh, you don’t? Hmmm.

26

Lyman: [00:40:37] I don’t know what happened—whether she ever met her parents.
She disappeared forever. It’s been a source—I was so devoted to her. She
was such a delight. We, in a costume party—do you know Paris?
Wise: Yes, somewhat.
Lyman: [00:40:55] All right. So you know the Sacré-Coeur, which is shaped like this.
And the Eiffel Tower, which is shaped like this. We went—no, sorry, not
the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty. She went as the Sacré-Coeur —and
I as the Statue of Liberty. I made myself a crown, and I put red paper around
my flashlight.
Wise: Perfect.
Lyman: [00:41:24] But, I got to Paris, [coughs] and my aunt couldn’t keep me in her
apartment. It simply didn’t accommodate two of us, especially me. So she
had arranged for me to go out to Brittany [Editor: Lyman uses the Anglicized
version of Bretagne] with this Parisian family. I was almost immediately
taken out to Brittany and spent the summer with this family. [Editor: The
town the Herlins lived in was Trebeurden] I [shared a room with] Elisabet,
who was a year older than I in the family, and then this gorgeous Claude,
who was the absolute vapid brain, older brother, and then a next younger
brother, Charlie, was absolutely hysterically funny and wonderful. Then a
much younger brother, Xavier. So the four of them were sort of my family.
And I adored both the parents. He (Louis Herlin) would come on weekends,
and she would be there. And her mother, Madame Lonbere, who started
every morning by saying, “Bon Jour, mes enfants. [Comment allez vous?]
Comme il fait beau aujourd’hui.” And that was the way the day started. And

27

we got bicycles. I’d had a skiing accident in the school and spent several
weeks in bed with my knee. But I rode the bicycle anyway, and my knee
would swell like this and hurt like the very dickens. But I wasn’t going to be
stopped by that. We rode bicycles all over Northern Brittany—literally.
Then we took a bus one day—or—yes, it was a day. We started out very
early in the morning, and we took a bus to Mont Saint-Michel across the
Brittany border into Normandy, of course. So it was quite a trip from where
we were. But everything worked. Then it was obvious that horrors were—
the war was coming. So Madame Herlin took me in to Paris to meet my
father who had come over to get me. He had arrived that day in Paris. We
came in by train. The train's leaving Paris -- people were hanging their bags
out the window because there was no room inside. It was unbelievable
chaos.
Wise: Where were the trains going?
Lyman: [00:44:19] Anywhere. Anywhere out of Paris. It was denuding Paris at that
point. Well, this was getting on towards evening by this time. She managed
to get me to my aunt’s apartment in Paris. And my father was there. And
she left me there. Then my aunt’s chauffeur said to her, if you want to
leave—you see, everybody thought the Germans were going to bomb Paris.
Wise: Oh, okay.
Lyman: [00:44:55] This was the day, it turned out, was the day of general mobilization
in France. And he said to her, “If you want to leave Paris, I can take you as
far away as you want to go as long as I’m going away. The minute I turn
around to come back, I will be requisitioned. So if you want to leave,—you

28

have to leave now.” So that early evening, without any meal, I, having just
arrived on the train from Brittany, they took my luggage [coughs] and what I
had—I had left a lot of stuff at the school to be shipped to me later. I never
saw it again.
Wise: Oh, you never—oh.
Lyman: [00:45:50] We got in August [the driver]’s car, my aunt and my father and I
sitting in the back, and we started out of Paris. It was wall-to-wall cars all the
way. We started out the Champs-Élysées to Versailles. Suddenly August
had the bright idea, and I don’t know why he had to be the first one to do
this, but he said here’s this great sidewalk, and he drove up onto the sidewalk
and started to drive along the sidewalk. Pretty soon we were leading this trail
of people driving down the sidewalk. Both sidewalks. Everything was going
out of town. There wasn’t anything coming into town. We just kept going.
We got as far as Chartres, and we tried to get food, and they told us they had
no food. They couldn’t serve us. So we went on out towards Brittany to a
little city named Amiens. There we got a pair of chairs in a lounge for my
aunt to lie across so that she could lie down. This was, by this time, the
middle of the night. I can’t remember whether we had something to eat. I
have a feeling we had something to eat at that point. But they were far
enough out so that we got something to eat. But I can’t even remember that
because my father and I walked around the town and we watched them
putting up the general mobilization posters in the dark. Then we walked
up—there was a fort—and we walked up to the fort. We thought we’d look
at it. And no way were they [going to let us in.] Fortunately, the interesting

thing was, my father, who was quite verbal in French, had this absolutely
execrable accent. [making sound] Just terrible accent. [As we drove and
drove and I got so tired.] And he—and I would start to speak to him in
English and lapse into French without even realizing I was doing it, because I
was getting so tired and speak French until he said something to me in
response, at which point I thought—aagh—and tried to go back to English.
I kept doing this. This happened to me later on when we also had a weird
trip down from Brittany to Bordeaux to finally get our boat out. But we
ended up—we took my aunt out to Dinard, which is across the river from
Saint-Malo to a hotel where she could stay for an indefinite period of time.
Then we went back to my family in Brittany. They were somewhat taken
aback by this, but very gracious. They got a room for my father and I simply
moved back into the family. For almost a month, we just did things, and
watched the news, and I can’t remember at what point—I think my aunt
stayed out there for several months, and then ended up going back to her
apartment and staying in her apartment even in the German occupation.
They let her stay there, although she had people camped on her. But she
ultimately died there.
Wise: Now, were you and your father trying to get out earlier?
Lyman: [00:49:46] Yes. We were trying to get out. He had had passage on a freighter
leaving from London. Well, it was a partial freighter and passenger ship. He
decided that it didn’t make any kind of sense to cross the channel at that
point. It was being mined. It was vulnerable. Getting a boat would have
been impossible. So he just decided—that was why we went back to my

30

family in Brittany. It turned out that half the people on this ship from
London were sent up to Glasgow and sailed on the Athenia, which was the
first ship that was sunk in World War II.
Wise: Oh, my goodness.
Lyman: [00:50:41] So there you are. Anyway, some three to four weeks later, we find
out we can get on a little tiny ship that had never crossed the Atlantic before,
but was a Bermuda Line ship, if we could get to Bordeaux. So we had this
wild trip through the night, and trains that didn’t go when they were
supposed to go, and trains that went when they weren’t supposed to go, and
so on. But we got there. We got into a hotel in Bordeaux, and we went to
the consulate and confirmed—we were offered places on one of the [United
States] Line ships. I think it was the [Manhattan]. But whatever it was, it was
the same ship that Dick [Lyman] took a month later from [Southampton],
and that came to Bordeaux with all its lights blazing, blacked out in Le Port
Autonome de Bordeaux and took on champagne for the U.S. Christmas
market, and then went out again with all its lights blazing. But that was his
story. In the meantime, my father said he was not interested. If we could get
on the [U.S. Line] ship we would have been in the ballroom or someplace,
whereas in this [Clyde-Mallory Line, Bermuda-based] ship, we got a
stateroom that we could share together. This was complicated by the fact
that I had only fairly recently started my periods, and of course, I got my
period as soon as we got onboard ship. I was, augh, miserable. Having to
share the stateroom with my father at thirteen was not fun. But he was
pretty resilient about it, and it worked. We had a ball. We were supposed to

31

stop in the Azores, and we went through the Azores because they didn’t
think we had enough water, but that was because they thought that we would
be full to the gills. But when people found out how little [a ship] she was, a
lot of people turned her down. The staterooms were all filled, but there
weren’t overflow crowds. So everything was pretty normal, except that it
took us, I think, twelve days to go across. We went through the Azores, but
it turned out we had enough water so we kept going. We didn’t stop. And
we had a ball. It was very funny because my father would have a Manhattan,
and he would ask for a ginger ale for me. But he said take the cherry from
my Manhattan and put it in my daughter’s ginger ale. Well, there were two
bartenders. So the first bartender saw what the situation was, so he put two
cherries in. So then the next bartender put three cherries in. By the time we
got to New York, I had a glass that had about this much ginger ale and the
rest was Maraschino cherries. It was very funny. Much later, when I went
from Philadelphia to New York to see Baby (Louisa Lee). I was sitting on my
suitcase waiting for them to pick me up in Grand Central—no, in
Pennsylvania Station. Suddenly this charming young man stood in front of
me and he said, “You’re the cherry girl.” It was one of the bartenders.
Wise: [laughter] All right. So I’m going to move along—you came back and you
went to Putney.
Lyman: [00:54:36] No, I came back and went to Friends’ Central School out on the
Main Line for a year. But I had chosen it over Friends’ Select because it
looked as though it was a little more trendy. It turned out it was a little too
trendy. Everybody was so socially minded, and it was all Main Line

32

Philadelphia stuff, and I found it just anathema. My older brother by that
time had graduated from Putney and was going to Reed College. My other
brother was finishing up at Putney and going to go to Swarthmore before he
went into the—of course, then they both went into the service. So I
determined that I was going to go to Putney.
Wise: Was this a family tradition, or—
Lyman: [00:55:35] No. The school had only just started. My brother was in literally
the first class.
Wise: Oh, that’s right. You said that.
Lyman: [00:55:40] The woman who started it was an extraordinary woman who really
was a devotee of progressive education. Carmelita Hinton. [Editor: Devotee
of John Dewey] She had taught at the Shady Hill School in Cambridge and
she wanted to have a school that would revolve around a farm and living on
this— [interruption] She wanted to have it be a working farm with the kids
involved in the running of the farm and the school with work jobs, but with
a rigorous academic program. And that’s what it has always stressed. It’s
that combination of both. It had some downtime for a while, but it’s really
returned to that general thesis. The woman who’s now running it is very
much along that line, and it’s exciting. It’s really a very interesting school,
and that the fact that it survived—It just had its seventy-fifth anniversary—
’35. Yes.
Wise: So you started there in 9th grade?
Lyman: [00:57:53] No. I started in 10th grade. I had three years there. It was
interesting that some people said, and it was justified criticism, that it was

33

such a rarified atmosphere. The kids that came there were everything, but
they were very select. We had the children of academics, we had the children
of performers, we had the children of social servants, we had the children of
politicians, we had children from nothing backgrounds. Not, at that point,
minority children. But that became a real issue for the school, and a very
important one, but always looking to mix people up. It was very challenging
because I thought I had a reputation to live up to with my brother. As long
as I tried to do that, I was having a miserable time. Finally, my house
director said to me, “You know, you don’t have to do that. You could just
be yourself.”
Wise: She perceived that that’s what you were trying to do?
Lyman: [00:59:19] Yes. And then things were much better. I had a wonderful three
years there. I fell in love—several times, but really lastingly for some time
with a young man. And Mrs. Hinton, the director, was so straight-laced
about that. She wanted kids to interact, but she didn’t want any sex. I
remember her calling me—and she was notorious for doing this, calling me
in to see what I was doing. And, she said, what about you and Allen? I said,
well, I love him. She was so taken aback by my just saying that baldly that
she didn’t know what to do. She sort of shook her head and said, oh, well,
then that’s all right. Of course, it was our—both of our experience in sexual
interaction, but that was not part of the discussion. It was interesting.
Wise: I have a question overall about the transitions. It sounds like you made a lot
of transitions—
Lyman: [01:00:40] Yes. Lots.

34

Wise: —from Westchester to Washington. Then loving Washington and leaving
Washington. How did you feel about—and then coming back, but coming
back to Philadelphia. Did you just float in and out of these things, or were
you sorry when you left Washington, that you were—
Lyman: [01:00:57] Yes, I was sorry. And I always kept—I’ve always had a close
connection with Washington, as you will hear when we get to my relationship
with Dick.
Wise: Right. But I mean did you resist it? When you left something, did you miss
what you had left? Or did you just move on?
Lyman: [01:01:15] No, because the people went on being sort of part of our lives. It
was the people as much as anything. You know, I did terrible things in
Washington. They were really—the little Greek girl who lived next to us on
1st Street took me to the Burly-Q on 9th Street in Washington. Her sister had
been picked up for soliciting. I’ve said I learned about sex from the bushes
around the Washington Monument. I mean not the Washington Monument,
around the Capitol. Things that went on under those bushes below the
Capitol building there were just amazing. But at the same time, here I was
with my two little twins--visiting the Senate office building, getting to know
the staff of various senators, feeding Claude Pepper’s little alligator
hamburger on a pencil and then riding, as we could in those days—riding
that little train between the Senate office and the Capitol every day, I mean
practically, and then playing on the Supreme Court steps, and that
experience. It was this weird mixture of things. It was better when we

35

moved and I ditched the little Greek girl who was not, shall we say—she was
a nice girl, but she was not a good influence.
Wise: But it sounds like you were fine then leaving Washington for Paris and all of
those experiences.
Lyman: [01:03:03] Well, as much as any thirteen year—or twelve year old can be fine
about that kind of transition.
Wise: Oh, okay.
Lyman: [01:03:10] That’s hard.
Wise: It is hard. That is hard.
Lyman: [01:03:12] It’s very hard. And, as I think about accommodating the
exigencies of this school director in her home—
Wise: Did you have a say in whether you would go to Paris or not? Or was that
just decided for you by your parents?
Lyman: [01:03:31] Oh, yes. Well, it was, but I thought it was the cat’s meow. I
thought it was very exciting. I loved the idea of learning to speak French.
And I did.
Wise: Right. Now, I’m going to fast-forward to the three years in Putney. How
did you decide to go to Swarthmore? Because that was sort of the next stage.
Lyman: [01:03:51] Well, my second brother, the one who didn’t go to Reed, went to
Swarthmore and I knew his friends. Several Putney families went to
Swarthmore, so there was sort of a tradition. And his sister was in my class.
My brother’s best friend, who would visit our house, and whom I knew,
came from Putney with my brother to Swarthmore. And then his sister and I
were in the same class, and we went to Swarthmore together. So there was a

36

sort of a pattern, although my favorite roommate, who is Marie Wasserman
Ridder, whose daughter, Carrie Ridder, was one of the students at Stanford.
Wise: Yes. I know Carrie, actually, from Washington.
Lyman: [01:04:58] You do?
Wise: Yes.
Lyman: [01:04:59] Okay. Well, Carrie’s mother was my roommate at Putney. They
also lived in that incredible house. Did you ever see their house out in
Whitemarsh? [Editor: Architects George Howe and William Lescaze
designed the William Stix Wasserman House, “Square Shadows”, 1932-43,
Whitemarsh, Montgomery County.]
Wise: No.
Lyman: [01:05:14] God, what is it called? It’s one of the Lescaze’s houses [Editor:
Swiss architect William Lescaze]. And it’s quite a house. I used to go to
parties out there. I went to my first New York ball courtesy of the
Wassermans, and changed my clothes in Crazy Bill’s apartment in the top of
the Chrysler Building. I mean—again, I had these extraordinary experiences.
[Editor: Financier William Stix Wasserman was called “Wild Bill”, Time
Magazine, April 24, 1939.]
Wise: Right. Yes. Yes, you did. Absolutely.
Lyman: [01:05:52] The Putney Wing was very influential. Very influential. And it
made an environmentalist out of me before I knew that’s what I was, which
is interesting, because it had such an emphasis. George Aiken was on one of
Mrs. Hinton’s—Senator George Aiken of Vermont, who was one of the very

37

first, quote, “environmentalists”, was very influential with her. The school
stressed environment from the word go.
Wise: That’s really quite something.
Lyman: [01:06:30] It really is something. It really is quite amazing. I found in my
early years of housing activism, I had this—because the two never met, the
Green Foothills [Editor: The Committee for Green Foothills] people would
never speak to the housing people. You know, the housing people were bad.
Wise: Right. Because they were building houses?
Lyman: [01:06:59] Yes. And taking open space. So I had this war going on in me,
which was an interesting thing. I sort of knew it was there, but I just
couldn’t admit it because it just didn’t add up. But then going to
Swarthmore, you have to understand that I went to Swarthmore in 1943—
well, the war began for us in ‘41. And that was a traumatic experience. I
remember exactly where I was when I heard the word about the bombing of
Pearl Harbor—in the main building at Putney. It just interestingly distorted
all sorts of things. Of course, this young man—my cousin from Portland,
Oregon, who was my age, came into my class at Putney. He and my
boyfriend became very good friends. They both went into the Mountain
service—I mean to the 10th Mountain Division of the Army--together, and
had quite different kinds of experiences. Allen was not shot up, my cousin
was and never fully recovered from it, although he did. He was always
somewhat eccentric, but he became even more eccentric. But he became a
veterinarian and ended up living with an Indian woman in New Mexico or
Arizona or someplace. I didn’t see him again. But we had been very close at

38

a point. He went to Williams for part of a year, and then went into the
Mountain Division. So a lot of Putney kids did, because it was skiing. The
10th Mountain Division was all about skiing. And they were in Leadville,
Colorado. They had an unbelievably rigorous training, and then they were
sent overseas. And, of course, I went off to college. There were other men,
although there were not a lot of Swarthmore men. One of the problems for
me about Swarthmore was [that] the coeducational aspect of it--which I went
there for, instead of going to Vassar where my mother had been--wasn’t
really working, shall we say. We had a bunch of the V-12 kids from
neighboring colleges, like Dickinson, and Franklin and Marshall, and some of
the smaller colleges in the Pennsylvania area. They were not Swarthmore
people. They came in as V-12 trainers. And the Swarthmore people went
into V-12 programs, and some of them stayed long enough. For instance, a
pair of brothers who were—one of them was a class ahead of me--Clayton
Rich, who was Dean of the School of Medicine here. He and his younger
brother, who was in my class at Putney, ended up at Swarthmore, but in the
V-12 program.
Wise: I see. So they came from those other schools to do the V-12.
Lyman: [01:11:14] Then all the Swarthmore people went off and we were left with
these young people coming in from other places who were not the same
caliber at all.
Wise: And then were they going to go as well? What’s V-12?
Lyman: [01:11:33] V-12 was the officer training school.
Wise: Right. So they weren’t going to be there very long either.

39

Lyman: [01:11:38] No, they weren’t going to be, and so there was a lot of turnover
anyway. And I seriously considered transferring at the end of—well, for one
thing, you should know, I totally failed my Freshman Psych course. I mean,
I really failed. It was so unbelievably humiliating because the professor was
the husband of the woman who had been my boss when I worked
temporarily as a volunteer at the [American Friends] Service Committee and
the Resettlement Administration. Wolfgang Kohler, who was a distinguished
psychologist, wrote a book called The Mentality of Apes, which was way
out ahead of the rest of the world in terms of developmental psychology. He
was a lovely man. I will never forget his meeting me after I’d failed this
course completely. He looked at me and he said, “Too many conferences,”
which he meant dates, I think.
Wise: Dates? There weren’t any men around.
Lyman: [01:12:52] Well, there were men around. I had dates. But it was not a really
exciting kind of environment. Then in the spring of my junior year, one
returned veteran had come back who was, by that time, married to one of the
delightful women who my brother had dated. My brother dated a whole
series of wonderful women, and then married a disaster from my standpoint.
But that’s neither here nor there. The first one of his wonderful women
married the first veteran to return to Swarthmore after the war. And Laurie
Page Pixton said, “Oh, I hear that Doug Cray and Dick Lyman are coming
back. I can hardly wait. They’re so wonderful.” So I was prepared for Doug
Cray and Dick Lyman to be terrific. I was taking a French course with this
French professor, was this little tiny guy. I was coming up the library stairs

40

and he was coming out of the library on the outside stairs. I had on my
Scottish Balmoral [Editor: Scottish bonnet – like a beret]. You know, the
Tam o’Shanter [Editor: A Scottish style hat originally worn by men], which I
had worn, and my father had got me medallions for it. It was quite a
handsome piece, shall I say. It had red and white things around and the blue
Tam O’Shanter. As this Frenchman came out, he looked at me and he said
“Est-ce-que c’est Francais?” Suddenly this voice behind me said, “Non, c’est
ecossais.” No, it’s Scottish. I turned around and here was the famous Dick
Lyman. That was my first hearing him, although I had seen him an earlier
time. He had been walking across the campus, across the main walk up to
the main building towards the library, and he had on a pork pie hat and a
raincoat that was flying open like this. Everything was sort of flying. He
walked under this branch of a tree and suddenly—and as I think about it, it
was the most uncharacteristic thing for him to do. He leapt up in the air and
grabbed this branch and began to swing back and forth. And I thought,
wow.
Wise: Did you know who he was at that time?
Lyman: [01:15:57] Oh, yes. I knew exactly who he was. And he had found out who I
was because I was Pete Schauffler’s sister who slept in the library. So that
was our introduction to each other. Anyway, that’s a whole different story.
Wise: That is another story. But I did want to know just a little bit about what
attracted you to him.
Lyman: [01:16:26] Well, obviously, that was a setup. Laurie, whom I adored, said
Doug Cray and Dick Lyman are coming back. That was the best kind of

41

introduction I could ask for. Then this swinging episode. Then this voice
saying, [speaking in French], and understanding exactly, and saying it in
French, was just great. By that time, I was living off-campus in French
House, which I did for three years. There were three of us who were sort of
Three Musketeers. But my two roommates were there—they were
roommates and I had a single room. They lived across the hall from me.
But we did most things together. The fact that we lived in this off-campus
house gave us a certain flexibility, shall we say. The first thing, Dick asked
me for a date to go to Plush Mill, which was the beer joint just over the town
line where you could sell beer. You had to either take a bus or walk quite a
long way to get there. I detested beer. Absolutely detested beer. And this
first date, I managed—I still don’t know how I did it. I drank two bottles of
beer. I never drank beer again for twenty-five years. I now drink beer
reasonably happily. But [coughs] not then. Anyway, I did it. We took to
having—he was dating several other women. His life has always had lots of
women in it, starting with his mother, whom I adored. Absolutely wonderful
woman. I got along with his father, but I adored his mother, who was a very
special person. The fact that we had this relationship is interesting, because
he’s an only child. One of the reasons why we had four kids was because
he’s an only child. But he’s always found it easy to get along with women. I
have just known that’s what I had to accommodate. It hasn’t affected our
relationship. [coughs] And I love many of his women. It just—that’s the
way it is. But at that time, I wasn’t quite so accommodating, and it was
difficult. I had to learn how to sort of adjust to that. But in the meantime,

42

he would come over to French House and we would drink sherry out of my
Mexican teacups. My parents were both overseas by this time, my father
with UNRRA [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Association] and my
mother with the Service Committee, doing refugee resettlement stuff. Both
of them, each of them in different ways. So I had the use of the family car,
and I moved us out of our house in Philadelphia to this little farmhouse out
in exurban [Philadelphia], beyond Paoli. But now, of course, it’s suburban.
But it’s a beautiful area. This little house was a little saltbox house with a
little kitchen lean-to. It had been lived in by squalid—literally squalid people.
I took a crew out from Swarthmore and cleaned this much of chicken dung
off the basement floor. We just took soap and water and washed down the
walls, and then washed down the floors from top to bottom. But it had this
little lean-to for the kitchen and the bathroom, and then it had a room about
the size, again, about this—not quite as wide as this, with a huge fireplace,
and a little circular stair up to the two tiny bedrooms above it. That was it.
And an attic.
Wise: Right. Now, was it at Swarthmore that you began to be interested in
education and teaching as a profession? Or how did that—because it seems
like early on you had a career in education.
Lyman: [01:21:55] Well, I did, but when Dick and I were married, that was when I
did my Shady Hill teacher training apprenticeship. But that came later. Let’s
see. What did I do? I was not a fast-track student through the war years—I
had three months off in the summer. The first summer, before I actually
went to Swarthmore, was when I came out here [California] for the first time.

43

And I lived with the Wagnets. Remember the head of the Social Security
[Administration]?
Wise: Yes.
Lyman: [01:22:41] All right. He was now running the social security program for the
state of California, and living in Oakland. My Putney roommate, Margaret,
who was known as Muff, was a student at Berkeley, and a sorority sister in
the Tri Delts. And I lived with the Wagnets in Oakland and spent the
summer—I mean the mornings, commuting to a job that I got really through
Gordon [Wagnet], only on my own, in a cannery. [coughs] And it was hell.
It was real hell, because I was much too tall. These little marvelous Mexican
women, who had no English, and I had no Spanish, were canning nineteen
to the dozens, when I was barely making—they would make three trays while
I made one, of canned figs. I had to stand on the floor, because if I stood on
the rack that kept you off the cement floor, I was way too tall. So then I
transferred and I ended up running the nursery program, which was hell,
because there were two little rooms about—again, about this size, but
separate from each other, and the kids were in both rooms. There was a
sandy playground around it with wire fence so the kids couldn’t get out. But
you could never see where all the kids were. It was hell.
Wise: Was this attached to the cannery?
Lyman: [01:24:38] The Del Monte Cannery.
Wise: Oh, wow. And was this near Oakland?
Lyman: [01:24:43] This was in Alameda. Then I would go in the afternoons to audit
classes at Berkeley. My first experience [in California] was Berkeley—

44

actually, the YWCA in Berkeley was a hotspot of radicalism at that point.
They were organizing against the then-governor on immigration issues.
Interesting way back when. Way back when.
Wise: Yes. Some things have never changed.
Lyman: [01:25:27] You know, he became Chief Justice. Who was he? Republican. I
can remember his being so nice to our kids at the first Rose Bowl, at the
luncheon. He was there. [Editor: The Chief Justice is Earl Warren]
Lyman: [01:26:22] So that’s what I was doing. And then—and, of course, the only
time I ever went anywhere near Stanford [coughs] was when we drove down
to Monterey. We saved up our gas and drove down to Monterey, and
Carmel. And everybody I was with was Cal people. They couldn’t say
enough opprobrious comments about the white shoe boys at Stanford.
Wise: Did you actually go onto the campus?
Lyman: [01:27:03] No.
Wise: No.
Lyman: [01:27:05] We went straight down the valley.
Wise: So did you adopt their same attitude about Stanford?
Lyman: [01:27:12] I thought Stanford was a white shoe boy school.
Wise: Hm-mmm. Meaning wealthy and—
Lyman: [01:27:16] Yes. That’s the way—the Harvards are referred to as white shoe
boys. It was you wore your white loafers—they weren’t loafers, they were—
Wise: Like bucks or something.
Lyman: [01:27:30] Yes. White bucks. That’s it. Exactly.
Wise: Did you think they were Republicans?

45

Lyman: [01:27:36] Everything. And dumb.
Wise: And that Berkeley was the school of the people, and the—
Lyman: [01:27:47] You got it. Absolutely. And it was. This was when it was just
beginning to grow. It was a very exciting place. This was the summer of ‘43.
And my parents gave me, as my graduation present, a railway trip across the
country. That was a second-class ticket so that I had to sleep in upper berths.
Fortunately, I had people strewn across the country in appropriate places. I
had an uncle in Chicago. I took an upper berth from Philadelphia to
Chicago, spent a few days [coughs] with my uncle. Then took another upper
berth to Portland, Oregon where another uncle was. Spent several weeks
there. And then I got not an upper berth, but a lower berth, down from
Portland to Oakland. I woke up frequently because I wouldn’t pull down my
shade. And just at sunrise, suddenly in my window was this gargantuan
mountain. Shasta. You know, how the railroad goes almost all the way
around Shasta? I got the whole thing. I was totally smitten. (noise) I was so
disturbed by the green and gold. The gold—quote. It scared me. That same
summer I ended up going down to Pasadena where my aunt and my
grandmother were, and staying. My aunt was a convinced Friend—you know
the difference between a birthright Friend and a convinced Friend?
Wise: No.
Lyman: [01:29:59] Quakers.
Wise: Oh, okay.
Lyman: [01:30:02] If you’d been accepted into the Quakers, you are a convinced
Friend. Otherwise, if you were born into it, you’re a birthright Friend. She

46

was a convinced Quaker. One of the things she was doing was to drive up
into the mountains every couple of months with magazines for the boys at
the Civilian Conservation Corps camp [the Conscientious Objector] up in
the—way, way back. I remember driving up in her little car, and it was
boiling over because we were going up and up and up and up and up. And it
was dark, and there was this big moon. It was threatening to boil over, so we
stopped, and a great spider walked across in front of us. I swear I heard
him—ckckc—ckckc—ckckc—it was this tarantula, like this. I want to tell
you, I was absolutely terrified. Then her secretary teased me by telling me
that the spiders that I had asked her about—and I was staying in Aunt Bee’s
study. She said, oh, those are just Black Widows. Well, you know, they
weren’t, but—God. But anyway, I went down there, and my grandmother
died while I was there.
Wise: Oh, dear.
Lyman: [01:31:33] Well, it was a very instructive thing. And I always felt—I adored
my aunt. And incidentally, she was my maid of honor at our wedding. She
was eight years older than my mother. I absolutely adored her. I had worked
as her research worker as a seventeen year old when she was out here and I
was in Virginia going to all the places that she needed to do work as a
Jeffersonian Scholar.
Wise: Right. Now which aunt?
Lyman: [01:32:04] [coughs] This was my mother’s sister. And she was our maid of
honor at our wedding, which was—I’ll show you a picture of it. It’s quite
weird. You probably know about it.

47

Wise: Well, I’ve read some about it, but—
Lyman: [01:32:32] Well, you remind me to show you the pictures because they’re fun.
But I was her matron of honor when she married for the first time at the age
of sixty-five. She was a woman of considerable parts. But I never forgave
her for the fact that she sent me into town with her secretary as my
grandmother was dying, so I wouldn’t be there when my grandmother died.
I had stayed up with my grandmother the night before to be the person to be
with her. Then she sent me off. I never quite forgave her for that, because I
should have been there. But at least she said—she told me that my
grandmother said to her, “Jing stayed with me last night, didn’t she?” So she
knew that I was there, and that was reassuring. But anyway, that’s another
story. Anyway—and my whole process of getting back and forth across the
country was a story in itself.
Wise: Yes. Especially during the war.
Lyman: [01:33:43] Yes.
Wise: Because those trains were often devoted to the troops. So I guess then,
when you were at Swarthmore, what were you thinking in terms of what your
career would be?
Lyman: [01:34:02] I guess I was thinking in terms of teaching. But I was really
thinking in terms of occupational therapy, more along that line. And my
courses—I told you I flunked the psych, and I had to make that up. And
then I almost flunked a Political Science course, too. I got a D in it. I was
not, shall we say, a spectacular student. But I was kind of a BWOC [Big
Woman of Campus].

48

Wise: But didn’t you say you had—when I spoke with you about scheduling this
interview, you said you had dyslexia, right?
Lyman: [01:34:57] Yes.
Wise: So wouldn’t that—
Lyman: [01:34:59] But nobody knew that.
Wise: Well, no. But it seems like that would certainly influence your ability to do
the work.
Lyman: [01:35:06] It was a real problem. Huge problem. But I didn’t know that until
my son, our second—our fourth child, was in junior high school and was
finally diagnosed officially as a dyslexic. I didn’t understand what that was. I
just thought I was an abysmally slow reader. And, you know—I coped. I cut
corners where I could. So anyway, Swarthmore was a mixed bag until Dick
came, and then it was—well, there were a number of guys, and he had a
number of women. And one of the things, we became engaged over
Christmas of our senior year. That’s early in our senior year. We were up in
Connecticut and we decided that we were going to get married. But we also
decided we would not tell anybody, because at that point, if you were pinned,
so help me, it was considered inappropriate for either of us to talk to
anybody else. I mean it was so archaic, you can’t believe it. We just thought
this is stupid, because this isn’t the way we want to operate. So we didn’t say
anything about it to anybody except our parents. Nobody. We made the
plan—I tried to get the then director of the American Friends Service
Committee, a wonderful man by the name of Clarence Picket, to marry us on
Barred Island—well, as it turned out, we couldn’t be married on Barred

49

Island, which was our island in the middle Penobscot Bay, which I had
bought on behalf of my parents in 1944 for seven hundred and fifty dollars.
And we built a log cabin. Subsequently, after my brother and we had kids,
we built a bunkhouse to stash the kids, and so on. But Clarence was not free
to do it. So we got a local Episcopalian minister from Deer Isle to agree to
come out and adapt his service to our needs, which were, shall we say,
informal.

Interview Session Two
June 30, 2010

(misc.)
Wise: There were two things I wanted to talk about before we got to Washington
University at St. Louis. And then we’ll just stay at Washington University a
little bit and then get you to Stanford. But the two before that were, one, the
genesis of your name, which I know I read somewhere, and now I couldn’t
find it again.
Lyman: [00:00:23] Yes. It comes from an Edward Lear nonsense rhyme called the
Yonghy-Bonghy-Bo. And it was about this little creature who lived on the
coast of Coromandel, which we actually went to when we were in New
Zealand. Although there were several ersatz ones, the real one is down there,
and it was very removed when that poem was written. And this little
creature lived there on a little heap of stones with his candle and his jug
without a handle. He fell in love with the Lady Jingly Jones, who was visiting
from Dorking. But unfortunately, she had a spouse in Dorking. And so she
had to decline his very kind offer. And he got on a turtle and rode away into
the blue yonder. And for what reason, my mother never knew. It was some
ten hours after the event [my birth] that she finally got to see me. She was
pretty well ripped up as one was in those days often. She said, having
decided if I were a girl child, that I would be Elizabeth, after her sister and
her mother, and Dudley, which was the name that my father’s father called
his wife, although she hated it, which always struck me as odd. And I hated
it, too. I mean I never thought Dudley was an attractive name. But
51

technically, I was Elizabeth Dudley Schauffler. But when she saw me, she
said, ah, the Lady Jingly-Jones. It just happened like that. And as a kid, I was
called Jingley—J-I-N-G-L-E-Y, only I think it’s spelled in the poem without
an E. But I always spelled it with an E. It gradually got shortened into Jing.
And I changed schools frequently in the course of my upbringing, as my
parents moved around from one place to another, and every time I changed
schools, I tried another diminutive of Elizabeth to see if it fitted. So I went
through the whole lexicon of Elizabeth diminutives. And none of them-within two weeks I would come back to Jing.
Wise: So you were always called Jing at home?
Lyman: [00:03:08] I was called Jingley, and one of my daughters still refers to me as
Jingley. But the others refer to me as various things that—we won’t begin to
go into all of those things.
Wise: But at each school, the teacher then would use some of these different
forms?
Lyman: [00:03:29] Yes—no. For instance, in my school in Switzerland, I was always
Elizabet. But to my friends, I was Jing. And people who knew me always
called me Jing. And then it got more and more prevalent to the point where
only my official signature was Elizabeth, and is still. And my professional
quote, since I never had a profession, my professional name was Jing. What
I’m known as in the various communities in which I’ve worked is Jing. Very
few people know about the Elizabeth unless they’ve had occasion to have
some sort of official signature from me. And then they’re puzzled.
Wise: On your check, is it Elizabeth, and in quotations Jing?

52

Lyman: [00:04:28] No. It’s just Elizabeth. And I hate the quotations, because it is
not a quote, it is me. And it’s always felt much more me. And if it weren’t
for my Aunt Bee—I didn’t really care that much about the fact that my
grandmother was also Elizabeth. It was my aunt who was so precious to me.
But she was always Bee in our books.
Wise: The other thing I wanted to hear you talk is the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender newsletter that wrote about you on your 70th birthday.
Lyman: [00:06:01] Oh, yes. That’s a good piece. That’s as good a piece as anything
that’s been written about me.
Wise: I thought so, too.
Lyman: [00:06:08] Yes. That’s by Edith Gelles.
Wise: I’d like to hear it from you as well as having read about it that you were at
Swarthmore and your best friend was Mrs. Roosevelt’s niece.
Lyman: [00:06:18] Well, one of them [best friends]. She was a good friend. And she
had a lot of friends, and I had a lot of friends, but we really clicked.
Wise: Right. And I wanted to hear about your—
Lyman: [00:06:30] She’s the one who took me down to the White House.
Wise: That’s the story I wanted to hear about from you.
Lyman: [00:06:35] And it was just a mind-boggling experience.
Wise: First, let’s have her name.
Lyman: [00:06:41] Amy Roosevelt. She was Eleanor’s niece by her brother—I can’t
remember his first name now. But the one—he was—like her father, he was
an alcoholic. He married and had three daughters, of which Amy was the
middle one. And the older one lived out here—no. Yes, the older and the

53

younger one ended up out here, after we got here. But Amy, I kept track of
Amy. And she was an absolutely brilliant teacher, and she was living in
Denver later on, much later. And she had a tragic—oh, that was interesting,
because she had a tragic marriage with a guy who turned out to be one of
these pathological beaters. And she got out of that eventually, but not easily.
And I always thought probably she had major lesbian tendencies. And her
home background was so challenged. But she was just absolutely the salt of
the earth, and as I say, a brilliant teacher. And we went to one of her classes
in her elementary school in Denver, and I taught kids how to make potato
puppets. And our kids did it. I mean they demonstrated it. Everybody was
sort of involved, and it was a great occasion. And she was one of these
people who could throw a baseball like a guy, and she could do practically
anything in the sports field. She was very talented. And just an ebullient
person with a tragic background. In the end, I think she just physically
deteriorated. She just went to pieces. And I didn’t see her in the last couple
of years, but—
Wise: But in college. Tell me about the trip to the White House.
Lyman: [00:08:59] Well, we went down on a Friday night, and it was the
Thanksgiving weekend. So they had been up at Hyde Park for Thanksgiving,
the family. And Amy and I went down. As we were walking up—and I
don’t know why we were walking up to the White House, but we were.
Maybe we were trying to save money, quite possibly. Or maybe—there was
no transportation. This was the middle of the war. This was in the fall of
‘43. No. Because—yes—because he was just starting the election. That was

54

it.3 But we were walking up, and we met this group of Chinese naval officers
who were studying at Swarthmore. And Amy said to them—they said, “Oh,
this is the White House.” I mean, their eyes were like this. She said, “Yes.
Would you like to go in?” And I thought these kids were going to die. And
they had very little English, and it was an interesting experience. But we all
went in. And, of course, she passed through the various barriers. And they
weren’t nearly as stringent then, of course. And she took these young men,
all in their spiffy little uniforms, and so rigidly proper, sort of on a tour of the
public spaces. And they were beside themselves with joy. It was just
obviously the highlight of their lives. It was pretty clearly the highlight
[coughs] of my life, too, although I’d been raised all around there, and my
mother’s office was right across the street from the Treasury Building, which
is right next to the White House, so that it was an area I knew backwards and
forwards. And I used to go to the Easter egg rolling when I was a young kid.
But this was obviously something quite different. And what struck me was
that we were taken up to our rooms, and for some reason or other, when I
was in the bathroom, I looked at the bathmat and it had all been carefully
darned. And I realized they weren’t throwing anything away. This was,
again, the middle of the war. And I can’t remember whether she said, “Oh,
yes, Aunt Eleanor does that sort of thing.” But it was something like that.
And [coughs] we had somehow eaten, I guess, before we came, because I
don’t remember eating anything that Friday evening there. But we had our
room up in the top of the White House. And in the morning, we went down
According to Richard W. Lyman, Jing Lyman went to the White House in November 1944. And
the election was recently over.
3

55

to have breakfast, and they had screened off one end of that long hall that
went down the main floor. My recollection, although it doesn’t fit with the
diagrams I’ve seen since then, but my recollection is that the Lincoln
Bedroom was just off here. I know I went to see it. But this place was
screened off, and they used it as a breakfast room. And we got down there
and President Roosevelt was all by himself at the table in his wheelchair with
the doctor. They were obviously talking. They had come down on the night
train, and he was in hysterics of laughter over the fact that [Eliot who] was
the one of the sons that had brought on a plane two Mastiff dogs that they
had put off two generals in order to make room for these two dogs coming
from London. And he was in hysterics over this. He thought it was the
funniest thing he’d heard of for years. He said it sort of put the generals in
their place. [coughs] And we were having this discussion about this, and
then it turned out that two elderly aunts had showed up. And so they had no
places at the breakfast table for them and for us, so we got sent back upstairs
to have breakfast upstairs on a tray. And that was all right. But then at
family Sunday dinner, I was seated on his right hand. And I was the only
non-family member, because the two aunts were there, and everybody else
was family. It was just a very small group. And since I was, in effect, the
only audience he had, he really turned it on. He just—he just—poof. It was
really amazing. And we had this sort of wonderful banter back and forth.
Wise: Oh, that’s great.
Lyman: [00:14:51] And I remember he—whether he’d just been to see Pavlova, or
whether he was just trying to remember about her, and fortunately, out of

56

somewhere I plucked this name, and my coup was to be able to provide him
with the name he was trying to find.
Wise: Oh, that’s great.
Lyman: [00:15:12] But, you know, it was trivial stuff like that. It was all sort of on the
surface, but it was just delightful. And everybody was having fun.
Everybody was involved in this, including Mrs. Roosevelt. But before that
was when Amy said, “Would you like to go riding?” And I grew up—well,
my parents at one point were running a summer camp while they were still
running the school. Up in the Catskills, they were also running a summer
camp. And my father had got this western pony that had been brought in to
be the mail wagon horse, but he didn’t work in harness. He had kicked the
wagon to bits, and so they had turned him loose in a field. And the
postmaster said, “Look, if you want him—if you can get him, if you can tame
him, you can have him. As far as we know, he’s okay for riding. You just
can’t put him between shafts.” So my father went up and curried favor with
him, and finally got him to come, and finally got on him, and finally rode him
back to the camp, and got back late after the camp—the camp kids were all
in bed—got back, put him in the barn. My brothers discovered him the next
morning. I guess my father must have left them a note saying the horse is
there—Prince, as he was called—Prince is there, but you’re not allowed to
ride him until I get out there. So when my father finally got up and came
out, here was my older brother lying along the back of this horse. And he
said, “But we didn’t ride him. We weren’t riding him.” And it was that kind
of thing. And I still have scars on my leg from where I was riding him and

57

he suddenly decided he wanted to go back to his barn, and they’d just put
new shale on the road and he went around the corner—shvvvsht—like this,
and I went sailing off.
Wise: So you knew how to ride.
Lyman: [00:17:50] I knew how to ride, but Mrs. Roosevelt’s horse was gargantuan.
And I had always ridden Western. I had never ridden an English saddle,
which means you have to post. I knew how to post, but, boy, there was
nothing to hang onto other than the reins. And I thought, oh, God. But I
did it. And he was fresh. It was a lovely crisp morning. And we rode
around, and it was fine. I survived.
Wise: Were you just on the White House grounds?
Lyman: [00:18:36] Oh, no, no. We went out to Virginia. We got chauffeured out to
one of the bases out in—probably what is Alexandria now. I don’t know.
Wise: Right. Right. Probably.
Lyman: [00:18:53] Fort Myer. Where is Fort Myer?
Wise: Arlington. It’s not very far out.
Lyman: [00:18:58] Well, that’s where it was. And so we went out and rode around
there, and then came back for this Sunday dinner. But in the meantime,
[coughs] I had no riding clothes with me. And that was when we walked in
to her [Eleanor Roosevelt’s] study. And aside from the time that I had
backed into her many years before, I had never laid eyes on her. I walked in
and she was sitting at her desk with her back to us as we came in. When she
stood up—I was then five foot ten and a half--when she stood up, she was
taller than I was. And I was staggered by that. I was not used to having

58

women who were taller than I. And the thing that just struck me, just almost
knocked me for a row of loops, was her eyes. They were the most gorgeous
eyes. And they were intense and blue, and she looked right at you, and she
talked right to you. She was the most wonderfully direct person. And when
it was good, it was very, very good. And I watched her—at a subsequent
point, when she came to speak at Washington University. And I went up to
speak to her after her talk and [coughs] asked about Amy. And she’d been
smiling. And her face suddenly went absolutely deadpan, just as though a
sheet of ice had come down over her. And she said—this was when Amy
was having this terrible marriage--she said it’s a very, very difficult picture.
She has a terrible marriage. And you could just feel the pain. When I read
Blanche Cook’s books about her, I understood the kind of pain that she had
had to live with all her life with family members, and that sort of thing. It
was so interesting to just watch this thing come down. [Editor: The
expression on her face after Jing asked about Amy.] But at that point, in her
study, in her bedroom, she couldn’t have been more wonderful and gracious.
And we sort of sized each other up, and she said, “Yes, I think you can wear
my boots and my jodhpurs. And here they are.” I mean they got them out.
And then I borrowed one of Anna’s shirts, and that was it. I had the shirt
and the jodhpurs and the boots.
Wise: And you were done. So let’s go to Washington University. And I know
we’re skipping over a chunk of your life.
Lyman: [00:22:11] Yes. That’s all right.

59

Wise: Cambridge, London, you know, a whole bunch. But let’s go to Washington
University. And you and Dick now are at Washington University. He’s a
professor, right?
Lyman: [00:22:25] He’s an assistant professor. Gordon Wright—you may remember.
Wise: Well, wait. I want to know what you’re doing. How many children have
been born by that point?
Lyman: [00:22:34] Two.
Wise: Two? So two kids have been born.
Lyman: [00:22:37] Yes, because one was born in Cambridge, and one was born in
Philadelphia the year we came back from London, and the only job we could
get was an interim appointment at Swarthmore where they knew him,
[coughs] teaching French Revolution, and the general history course at
Swarthmore.
Wise: Right. So now you’re at Washington University, he’s assistant professor. Is
he perfectly happy there?
Lyman: [00:23:14] Well, yes. In fact he was selected by the chairman of the History
Department who was not there.
Wise: Of Washington University.
Lyman: [00:23:29] At Washington U. And the chairman of the Political Science
Department, who was Tom Eliot, who was a former congressman from
Massachusetts. One L, one T—was the person who actually interviewed him
for this job4. And you’ve got to understand that at that moment there were

According to Richard W. Lyman, Tom Eliot never interviewed him as a candidate for the job at
Washington University, though Eliot did ask about Lyman when Eliot went to Cambridge in the
course of his travels. Eliot recommended Lyman's appointment on the strength of those discussions.

4

60

very few jobs teaching history, let alone teaching your own field. There
just—there was nothing existing. It was just the most absolutely barren sea.
Wise: Why?
Lyman: [00:24:24] Because nobody had any money. He had interviewed for teaching
Western Civ at the Colleges of the Seneca in New York, and a whole bunch
of irrelevant positions. And then this thing came along in which he was
being invited to come and teach at Washington University. It was to teach
British History. Tom was subbing for the chairman of the History
Department. So we came to Washington U. in 1952. When he came home
and said there’s a job teaching British History at Washington University, in
St. Louis, and I said, “St. Louis? You’ll see me dead before I ever go and live
in St. Louis.” So we went to St. Louis. And I went out there, I flew my first
flight out to St. Louis to pick out an apartment and found an apartment on
the third floor of what was the next thing to a tenement house. But it had a
fair amount of space. It turned out that it was a robber baron place where
we were charged an exorbitant rent. And some days the heat would be
blasting out and you had to keep the windows open to survive, and the next
day there would be no heat and it would be snowing through the closed
windows. It was that kind of a place.
Wise: But he must have been very grateful to find a job teaching British History.
Lyman: [00:26:35] Oh—yes, and of course, Tom became his mentor. And his wife,
Lois Eliot, became our cherished friend, and stayed that way for the rest of
her life. And it just—they sort of opened all sorts of doors for us. And Tom
comes back into the picture later on, because he rose to be Chancellor of

61

Washington University, Tom did. But in the meantime, Dick was in a fair
way to become Chairman of the Faculty Senate5—he got promoted—no, he
didn’t get promoted to Associate Professorship, but he got a raise. That was
it. Oh—we came on a salary of three thousand dollars6.
Wise: Whoa.
Lyman: [00:27:48] Whoa. Now, mind you, those were different dollars. But still, in
all. And then he got promoted to a salary of four thousand. That was it.
And I decided we had to [move]—oh, we got the next thing to an eviction
notice from this apartment building because we were organizing the other
tenants.
Wise: Oh, wow. You were?
Lyman: [00:28:11] What?
Wise: You were organizing the tenants?
Lyman: [00:28:12] Oh, yes. Absolutely.
Wise: Oh, that’s great. Were you doing that personally?
Lyman: [00:28:15] Yes. Of course. And we had the two kids at that point. And a
standard white French poodle unclipped that people would stop us on the
street and said is that a sheep or a dog. She was wonderful, but she was
absolutely crazy when it came to squirrels, and she would run in through the
streets, run into anything trying to get a squirrel. But anyway, we had to walk
her, of course, take her out.

According to Richard W. Lyman, there was no Faculty Senate at Washington University, so he was
never "in a fair way to become chairman" of it. Lyman did speak up in faculty meetings more than
most assistant professors, which, Lyman thinks, commended him to Eliot.
6 According to Richard Lyman, his starting salary at Washington University was $4,000, not $3,000.
He was paid $3,700 the year he worked at Swarthmore.
5

62

Wise: Rain or shine, snow or—
Lyman: [00:28:59] Rain or shine, exactly. Yes, all of the above. And I was walking
her when—oh, well, I don’t know when I got this letter from the real estate
company saying, “In as much as your complaints amount to more than all
the rest of the tenants in the building, we suggest you find alternative
accommodations.”
Wise: I love the fact you were already doing tenants’ rights.
Lyman: [00:29:23] Yes. Right. No. But—well, I needed it. My God, they needed it.
Wise: It didn’t take you long.
Lyman: [00:29:30] No, it didn’t take me long. It certainly didn’t. But we had lived on
the top. At Swarthmore we had lived on the top of a men’s dormitory. And
our babysitters were all men, which was a great beginning—because our two
first babies were girls.
Wise: Oh, there you go.
Lyman: [00:29:48] And they loved it. Well, that’s another story, too. But anyway, so
then Lois helped us find this little house in a funny little sort of cul-de-sac
backing up on the Delmar Wabash Railroad. And the trains, the diesel
engines would come into the Wabash Railroad Station, and they would park
literally across the hall from here, from our house. There was a street
between us and them. And they would sit there and they would go—
aauuugh—aauuugh—aauuugh—as they were waiting to—you know, revving
up before they took off again. And the first week I thought, my God, I’ll
never live through this.
Wise: I can imagine.

63

Lyman: [00:30:41] And within a week, we never even heard them anymore.
Wise: Isn’t that astonishing how that happens?
Lyman: [00:30:45] Isn’t it amazing? Just incredible. We didn’t think anything about it
anymore.
Wise: Humans are so adaptable.
Lyman: [00:30:52] It was a classic case of understanding about adaptability. It really
was. So anyway, we had that little house. And Cricket was born in a little
house. Cricket is Christopher, and who’s always been Cricket. As I’m Jing,
he’s Cricket. And still at fifty-five he’s Cricket, although his professional
name is indeed Christopher. But he was born at Washington University
Maternity Hospital. And I had—my Ob Gyn was William Masters of
Masters & Johnson.
Wise: Oh, my goodness.
Lyman: [00:31:38] Yes. This was before he had tied up with Johnson. And he was
just beginning to do the first rudiments of fertility stuff. But he had been ten
years in practice. And he was the funniest little man. He was this little egghead, and he told me when I came in. He said, “I have two rules for all my
patients.” And he was looking at me with these great beady eyes. He said,
“One is that I don’t want to lock any doors after the horse is stolen. You’ve
got to tell me if you have any problems at all immediately. And the other is
that, if you are late for more than one appointment, I’d be glad to refer you
to another obstetrician, but I will not handle you anymore.” And I used to
leave my house in University City, drive down to St. Louis Maternity, park
my car, go up, have my appointment, and be home again within an hour. On

64

an Ob Gyn appointment. My God, whoever heard of it? I used to wait two
hours in Philadelphia before Holly was born for this prima donna. Anyway,
that was the way he was. And yet, he was with me in the delivery room.
And after Cricket was born, and he turned out after two girls, and everybody
had told us that if you do two, you do three so we would have a girl. And it
turned out to be a boy. And we didn’t know. In those days, one didn’t. And
I always like that. He turned to me and he said, “Would you like to call your
husband right now?” He said, “We’re not supposed to do this from the
delivery room, but would you like to call your husband right now and tell
him you have a son?” And I said, “Oh, yes. I really would.” So he dialed
the number, handed me the phone, this funny little man, and stood there,
and I said to Dick—I got Dick’s mother, and I said, “Has Dick come back?”
He left me off at the hospital and went to a faculty meeting. And I said, “Is
Dick back from his faculty meeting?” And Ba said, “Yes, he’d just come in.”
And I said, “Well, I better speak to him.” And I got it. He said hello. And
he said, “You’ve had the baby?” I said, “Yes, you have a son.” And there
was this stunned silence. And then he said, “My God, how—oh, hurray!”
And he just was so thrilled. But then, with my second son, I went into labor- well, for about a week, I was in labor. And I would start up and then go
back. And I changed all the screens in the house. And my poor mother-inlaw was going crazy because I was doing these nutty things because I was
beside myself to get this damn baby born. And I was huge. Well, the long
and short of it was that he said, “It’s Friday. You come in. And if you
haven’t delivered by Monday, I’ll induce it.” And I didn’t. So on Monday,

65

he induced me. And it took forever. But finally, this gargantuan thing came.
He was nine pounds, fourteen ounces. He was huge. But perfect. And I
still see this funny [little solemn] man standing at the end of my bed when I
got back to my room, he came in and he stood at the end of my bed, and he
[was smiling all over and he] said, “I have to tell you that in ten years of
delivering babies, I have never succeeded in delivering a live baby until today
under these circumstances.”
Wise: Oh, wow.
Lyman: [00:36:09] And I said, “Tell me more.” It turns out that the umbilical cord
was coming down first. And what he did, by inducing me, and the fact that I
hadn’t ruptured my waters before that, he was able to keep pushing this cord
aside as the baby came down for what seemed like three weeks, but was, you
know, an hour or so—as this baby came down so that he wasn’t strangled by
it, which was just fascinating. And I still see the—he had a grin from here to
here, this man who never smiled.
Wise: Right. Very serious guy. Just like this. So we’ve sort of set the scene—
Lyman: [00:37:03] So then we have four kids.
Wise: You have four kids. You’re still in St. Louis. And you’re happy.
Lyman: [00:37:08] Yes. Very much so.
Wise: Not looking for a job, not looking to move. Is that correct?
Lyman: [00:37:12] Not really, except that then at the job market, that Christmas,
that’s when Gordon Wright came out.
Wise: What is the job market?

66

Lyman: [00:37:27] It’s where they—at Christmastime the Historical Association
always had a job market at their annual meetings, you see. And that’s where
they hired everybody.
Wise: I did not know that.
Lyman: [00:37:42] Oh, yes. Absolutely. And the MLA does it, and so forth. I
imagine they still do it. But it’s a pretty hairy situation for a young person.
Wise: Well, you don’t have to go, do you?
Lyman: [00:37:59] Oh, yes, you do. I mean if you want to go anywhere, you’ve got to
be visible. And you have to have published, and—
Wise: But if you’re happy where you are, and you don’t want to go anywhere, you
don’t have to go to the job market, or put your résumé in.
Lyman: [00:38:16] Well, you pretty much have to anyway. You’re probably looking
for other people. There’re a whole lot of reasons why you had to go. And
every Christmas, his Christmas week was ruined because he always had to go
off to this meeting. [laughs] I took him down to one of these meetings. I
can’t remember which, on the day after Christmas, on Boxing Day—no, two
days later—I took him down to the St. Louis Station, and then I had Tim—
Tim was—I mean Cricket was a baby at that point. And Holly was this little
stumpy creature. She wore the snow suit that we had got for Jenny in the
wartime when it was the only thing available. It was a little boy’s snow suit
with a little helmet, so that all you saw was this face. And Holly had what
Jenny referred to as her big cow eyes. We’d seen Dick off on his train, and
we were coming back and about to go through the door into the waiting
room. And the doors flew open and this guy came running in. Holly was

67

right in front of me and he just started to mow her down. And he put his
hand on her head and stabilized her and himself, and then turned her face up
and looked down into this little face. He just looked at this face, and then he
went—blrb-blrb-blrb—like this, and then streamed off to catch his train. I
can still see these eyes just sort of looking at him. It was so funny, in this
funny little cap.
Wise: Oh, wow. So Dick’s off to the job market.
Lyman: [00:40:08] He’s off to the job market. But he wasn’t expecting to get a job at
that point. And the job market was in St. Louis. And—the year that
Gordon Wright from the [Stanford] History Department came on behalf of
Tom—whatever his name was—the then head of the department—looking
for someone to replace Carl Brand. Carl Brand had done the English
[history] from beginning to end. And in the end, they hired Dick and Gavin
Langmuir. Langmuir to take the early part, and Dick to take the Modern
British.
Wise: Two people to replace Carl Brand?
Lyman: [00:41:03] Yes. Right. And, of course, Carl Brand had started the British
Labor Collection at the Hoover Institution. And Dick contributed
significantly to that. And he was very excited about coming and being able
to work with that collection because he had just published The First Labour

Government, which was on Ramsey McDonald in early [1920's] Labor
Government for the first time in Britain. And his book had had significant
acceptance in the historical field. It was well-received. And so that was a

68

good beginning. And it was on the strength of that that they were then
interested in hiring him to replace Carl’s modern part.
Wise: Now, I want to hear about you though. Did Dick get the offer at the job m
market, or did he come home and hear about it? And then what was your
reaction?
Lyman: [00:42:09] Well, at that point, we had four little kids. And we were living in a
house that we just bought that we couldn’t afford. And it was a wonderful
house, but it had crumbling aspects, shall we say. And it was a challenge.
But we loved it. It was called Happy House. It was in the bottom of a culde-sac. And interestingly enough, Jenny was the one non-Jewish kid in the
public school. All the Catholics went to parochial school. It was University
Heights in St. Louis. And this was an interesting experience because at the
Jewish high holidays, Jenny was practically the only student who went to
school. But we didn’t really even think about that much.
Wise: Now, where were you when you heard about an offer to Stanford?
Lyman: [00:43:25] I can’t remember. I suppose it was after he came home after this
meeting and said there’s a job there.
Wise: And how did you feel?
Lyman: [00:43:31] Well, I thought that sounded very interesting. But it was Stanford.
I mean, that was the white shoe school.
Wise: That was what I was wondering, whether you would feel that way.
Lyman: [00:43:42] Yes. I was ambivalent about that. But I loved the idea of
California, but then, all the people at Washington University said, oh, you
can’t do that. That’s a nothing job. And he wasn’t even going to get tenure.

69

He was only going to get an associate professorship, but no tenure for the
first year. And everybody said, oh, you mustn’t do that. And everybody at
Washington University was trying to dissuade him, of course, from going.
Wise: But isn’t it normal that you wouldn’t get tenure right away? Wouldn’t you
have to work your way into tenure?
Lyman: [00:44:22] It would all depend a little bit. And for an associate professor, yes,
you wouldn’t get tenure with an assistant professorship.
Wise: But he would be an associate professor.
Lyman: [00:44:33] But quite often, if you were invited to be an associate professor,
you got tenure, too.
Wise: You’d be on a tenure track, and have to work toward it?
Lyman: [00:44:40] Yes. Right.
Wise: Got it.
Lyman: [00:44:41] Well, he was that, but that was another issue. Then finally he told
Tom—why can’t I remember his name? Tom—I want to say Tom Barkley,
but that was a different one altogether. That was not the one I’m thinking
of. And he was a distinguished American historian. Writer of many books.
And he was at that time chairman of the department. [Editor: Thomas A.
Bailey, head of the History Department, 1952-55 and 1957-59] Anyway, Dick
said, “I really can’t do this without having come out to see the situation.” So
he flew out here and was entertained by the top level of the History
Department, royally entertained. Wooed, shall we say. And Nan Brand, who
had a fabulous garden, and this was in February. Dick came back with this
box of flowers, and all four of the kids and I all had stomach flu. And he

70

called me from the airport and he said, “Where are you?” And I said, “You’ll
have to get a taxi. We can’t come to get you.” I was beginning to come out
the other side, but it had been absolute hell, because I’d been trying to cope
with all of these kids on my own and feeling absolutely miserable myself.
Wise: Right. Almost impossible to do.
Lyman: [00:47:07] Yes. One of those situations. And he got out of the taxi and he
came in, and he had this huge box. And he said, “Nan Brand sent you this
box.” And I opened it up and here was this panoply of gorgeous spring
flowers. Camellias, daffodils, grape hyacinths, all laid out like a florist
contribution in this gorgeous thing. And I said, “Can we go today?” [laughs]
But then we had to sell the house. And we’d only owned it for two years.
And you’re not supposed to do that sort of thing. We actually made—we
didn’t lose money on it.
Wise: That’s a good thing.
Lyman: [00:48:02] And that was a good thing. And we got out here, and Otis Pease,
whom you probably wouldn’t remember.
Wise: I know that name though.
Lyman: [00:48:10] Well, he was the trustee by the time you came along. But he had
gone up to the University of Washington. But we all lived on Salvatierra
Street in those duplex houses. And we lived at 591, which was the inboard
side of the big brown-shingled one that Lyman Van Slyke now lives in. They
bought it from us, across the street from the Pearce Mitchell houses. And
the Peases owned the grey duplex side of it nearest us so that we were like
this. And they had four kids and we had four kids. And we had a kid, and

71

then they had a kid, and we had a kid, and they had a kid, and so on. So it
was all stair-steps down. And those eight kids just simply flowed back and
forth between these two houses. And although there was ostensibly a fence
on their side, it didn’t make any difference. I mean, you never knew who was
going to be there at any given moment. And they set up this incredible, with
Jonathon, the oldest Pease boy, who was between Jenny and Holly, very
creative and made cardboard houses. And they set up in our playroom,
which was a big glassed-in porch on the side of that house, with a big wide
shelf on the end of it looking out towards the street. They set up on that
something called Pine Tree Corners, which was a town. And they made all
the houses for it. And they used those little rubber bears, they were about
that big and they were panda bears.
Wise: Oh, okay.
Lyman: [00:50:07] Yes. And we had God knows how many hundred of those bears
between the two houses. And everybody had their own bears. And then we
had a few Mavericks, shall we say, that weren’t bears, but who were part of
the Pine Tree Corners picture. And we had political [elections]—and you
never knew when you opened something whether there was going to be a
piece of campaign literature. It was a crazy and wonderful environment.
Wise: That’s great.
Lyman: [00:50:41] And, of course, there was very little traffic in those days. The only
time I ever remember a problem with traffic was the one day we had given a
dinner party at night. And it was so strange. As everybody was leaving, quite
late—you know, for us, it would have been impossible because we still had to

72

do all the dishes and everything. Everybody said, “Whew, it’s cold. It smells
like snow.” And everybody said, “Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.” And the next
morning—we got to bed, I think, at two o’clock finally having cleaned up
everything. And at six o’clock, the telephone rang. And it was the kids in
the other half of our house, the older kid, and saying, “Hey, Jing, it’s
snowing.” And I said, “Thanks a lot, Jane.” We had just come back from
England, and, you know, we’d seen snow—we didn’t care about snow. I
said, “Thanks a lot, Jane,” and hung up. Two minutes later the telephone
range again, and it was her mother. And Anne said, “You know, I don’t
think you really understood what Jane said. It’s snowing.” [laughs] And I
said, “Oh, all right.” And when we got up, sure enough, it was still snowing.
And there was snow all over the schoolyard, which was, of course, where the
Pearce Mitchell houses are now, was the Stanford Elementary School where
our kids all went to school. And the playing field was completely covered
with snow. And the kids, of course, went out and they made snowmen, and
it was wonderful. They had a great time. And then, as they came in to go to
lunch, along came a little Volkswagen, and a bunch of Stanford students
jumped out of the Volkswagen. They opened up the hood in front, put in—
took the snowman in its pieces, and put it in the trunk, closed the trunk and
drove off with the snowman. I thought the kids were going to have a fit.
[laughs]
Wise: Oh, my gosh.
Lyman: [00:53:06] That’s so grossly unfair. And then, of course, by that time, there
wasn’t enough snow left to do anything more. So that was that.

73

Wise: Did you have a sense that you would at some point develop a career with the
kids? Did you feel that—well, I’m going to just do these kids—
Lyman: [00:53:28] No. I was, at that point, that was beginning to be when I felt at a
total loss. I went through the pits. Absolutely the pits. Especially after Tim
started kindergarten. And I didn’t know—I had tried a puppet business. I
made puppets and I actually sold them to a place that was called House of
Today on University Avenue that sold crafts and things. But I was so slow
making them that I could never make a business out of it. But it was
interesting, in light of what I ended up doing, working on Women’s Micro
Enterprise. It was interesting to have had that experience of discovering how
hard it is to make something that makes you a business. That being able to
do something is not making a business. And this was obviously not gelling,
and it was satisfying because I loved the creativity of making the different
puppets. And I made all different kinds. And then I taught one summer
school program over at Escondido School for kids making puppets with
papier-mâché and so on. And I discovered that in order to teach here, I
would have to get a credential. And that meant going back to school. And I
was not about to go back to school again. I’d had it up to here with school.
Wise: Right. But when you got married, was your vision going to be that you
would have a career?
Lyman: [00:55:22] Yes. I was going to work in social service of some kind. In fact—
Wise: You were somehow going to—
Lyman: [00:55:26] In fact, Dick and I came almost to a parting of ways when it was
clear I could go to Germany for two years with the Service Committee with

74

the Quakers working on one of their relief programs. And he simply said
unequivocally, that’s fine, if you do that. But just don’t expect me to wait for
you to come back, because I’m not that kind of a person.
Wise: Were you married at that time?
Lyman: [00:55:59] This was still while we were in college. And I guess we were—
engaged, but I mean he just laid it out absolutely flat.
Wise: So you knew when you got married to him that you would be following
where he went?
Lyman: [00:56:15] Well, one did. That was not an unacceptable—I mean, it’s what
was assumed you would do.
Wise: Well, and also it’s not—it would not be unacceptable to be a mother of four
children and not have any other aspirations.
Lyman: [00:56:28] Absolutely. Absolutely.
Wise: But somehow in the back of your mind you did have other aspirations?
Lyman: [00:56:32] Well, I knew I was going to have to do something.
Wise: So you always had that sense.
Lyman: [00:56:37] God, what a meticulous housekeeper I was. Whew. Because my
mother had been very casual about this sort of thing, and we’d always had
help that had done all the things. And interestingly enough, my older
daughter is like Marnie [Marnie Schauffler, Lyman’s mother]. She’s the most
disorderly person I’ve ever known. And I think it was mainly reaction
because, boy, I just kept everything absolutely—unlike now. I’ve grown
much more casual about this sort of thing and did over the years. But, at
that point, my flowers were always right, and I went out into the highways

75

and byways and picked all the current things that were growing up in the
highways and the byways—and we had wonderful flowers in our own garden
on Salvatierra Street. And we had this bunch of fruit trees where our New
York friend came and looked at this and said, “Gee, do they work?” [laughs]
But I just fell apart at the seams. I think I wasn’t even involved with the
PTA yet at that point. And I just couldn’t figure out what I was good for.
And here was Dick making leaps and bounds and getting into academic
administration, and I was going nowhere. And I just didn’t know—I literally
didn’t know what I was good for. I totally lost my self-confidence. I came
from a family that always believed that you sucked it up and you didn’t admit
you had any problems. And you didn’t ask for help, for God’s sake. So
counter to everything that I had been brought up to cherish, I went to the
Palo Alto Medical Foundation and asked for help, and got a wonderful man
by the name of Julian Pichel, who I would go—I can’t even remember—I
think it was once a week for a while, and then gradually every other week,
and then once a month, and so on, just for psychiatric counseling. I can’t tell
you what it was he did for me, except that he was a resource. He helped to
get me perspective about things. And then, lo and behold, in ‘64—the early
‘60s that I was going through all of this because in ‘64 was when Bob Byers
and everybody went down to Selma.
Wise: Oh, wow.
Lyman: [00:59:54] Yes. And then in the fall of ‘64, two realtors, both of whom were
active members of the California Real Estate Association, which is now
called something else, but that’s what it was, the CRA in those days—and

76

they were coming up with this referendum at the state level to do away with
Fair Housing in perpetuity. The Rumford Act had been passed first by
Berkeley, and then at the state level in ‘63. And in ’64, the CRA came up
with this referendum for the November election to do away with Fair
Housing in perpetuity. And that’s when Bernie—Jesus, here I go again.
Sociology Department, and his wife was in the School of Education—
Elizabeth—
Wise: Well, we can certainly find that. [Editor: This was most likely Bernard P.
“Bernie” Cohen who joined the Department of Sociology and Anthropology
in 1959. Elizabeth Cohen joined the department during the 1970s but may
well have been in the School of Education before that. Professor Lawrence
Ryan noted in his oral history interview that there were nepotism rules on
Stanford at one time when two spouses couldn’t work for the same
department, so the other spouse which was often the wife went to a related
department.]
Lyman: [01:01:24] They developed a system for testing sometime over that summer,
because I worked as a volunteer for Liz doing surveys down Alma Street, of
people’s reactions to minority living.
Wise: Now, just for the record, [the CRA developed a proposition which] was
called Proposition 14, right?
Lyman: [01:01:50] Yes. Right. And we had the “No on 14” position. On Waverley
Street, there’s an Episcopal Church now that’s practically moribund, but it is
there. It’s a very modern concrete building with a central sort of almost like

77

a chimney on it right here. And just inboard of that was an old Quonset hut
that had been a Purity market.
Wise: Oh, yes. I remember that.
Lyman: [01:02:35] Yes. That was not a market anymore, and we took that building as
the headquarters for No on 14. It was filthy dirty. But we had this huge
stream of volunteers coming in. And these two real estate people, Len
Cornell and Howard Lewis were the two [keys]—and Len was the brilliant
organizer. Howard is still alive, still going forward, still very conservative, a
Republican [but very supportive of Fair Housing]. His sister lives here in
Channing House.
Wise: Do you spell Lewis L-E-W?
Lyman: [01:03:25] L-E-W. Len Cornell had been a conscientious objector in World
War II, and had worked in mental health. He was one of these catalytic
creatures who could stimulate people to all sorts of things, and he organized
this whole campaign, but would have very little to do with it himself, except
he would speak from the standpoint of being a real estate salesman. He
could sell anything. And then John [Rutherford] from Los Altos Hills, a
businessman, joined. We had everybody involved in this. We had the most
incredible group of people who took different parts of this whole campaign.
Wise: Were Cornell and Lewis the creators of Prop 14?
Lyman: [01:04:27] No, no, no. They were the fighters of Prop 14. Howard Lewis
stood up in the CRA annual meeting and said you can’t do this. This is going
at it backwards—this is not the way to do this— and got black-listed. They
both stood up against it [Proposition 14], and that’s why they organized us

78

into this whole campaign to undercut it. It ended up with Berkeley and the
Mid-Peninsula. Everything from Atherton down through Mountain View,
and Los Altos, and Los Altos Hills, all carried the No position. The only
other place besides Berkeley that did was— I want to say Mohawk, but that’s
not right. One of the northern counties.
Wise: Oh, right.
Lyman: [01:05:57] I can’t think what it is now, but we actually carried the No when
the state went two for one for Proposition 14. But in the end, the Supreme
Court threw it out as unconstitutional.
Wise: Now, what about you? What did this do for you?
Lyman: [01:06:25] Well, what happened was that Bernie Cohen. Bernie Cohen, Liz
Cohen.
Wise: Okay. But is this what brought you out of the doldrums?
Lyman: [01:07:24] Yes. Absolutely. And this was very interesting because in the
meantime, here in Channing—my mother had introduced me to Lucy
Sprague Mitchell, who was the founder of the Bank Street College of
Education. And if Dick had gone to Columbia Graduate School, I would
have gone to Bank Street. But because he went to Harvard, I went to Shady
Hill instead and did their apprentice teaching program. And that’s when I
became a carpentry teacher.
Wise: Right. I’ve seen that in that good story that we were talking about.
Lyman: [01:08:04] Yes. And actually, the table that I made that got me that job is in
the other room there. We used it as our dining room table until we could
buy a table that was big enough—well, we managed to seat six people around

79

it, but it was a stretch. [laughter] But in any case, when we got started on this
campaign, Bernie Cohen simply turned over the office operation of the
precinct work. And I would assign people to precincts to cover. I worked
on the principle that every single person who had to sell this to somebody,
the No on 14, was a convert, that they would talk about it in their social
environments and spread the word. And it worked like a charm. I can’t tell
you exactly how many people I put out into the highways and the byways,
but sometimes I would have six or seven people working one precinct. They
would all be having to sell this idea of No on 14 to somebody. They had to
make the argument, and they had to feel—as they made the argument, they
had to feel in their gut that this was what they wanted. It was fabulous. It
worked like a charm. I just sent people out and got back results, and then it
was just miraculous, because we actually carried the No position here.
Wise: Yes. It was great.
Lyman: [01:10:06] And I sent out thank you letters to everybody who had worked.
When it was a couple, I sent one letter to couples and most of them were
couples, because they’d work often in tandem, because they often had to
work in the evenings, and so they worked as a couple. I sent out over three
hundred thank you letters to people who had worked precincts. This was,
again, Atherton through Mountain View, Los Altos and Los Altos Hills.
And we got fabulous people from all of these areas to work on this
campaign.
Wise: Now, did you realize that you were going back to Shot’s Alley in the—

80

Lyman: [01:11:04] No. I had no idea. I was just simply doing what I felt convinced
had to be done.
Wise: Because remember your statement.
Lyman: [01:11:18] No, I didn’t tie the piece of—
Wise: You didn’t at that time—
Lyman: [01:11:20] I hadn’t tied the pieces together until much, much later. Actually,
I hadn’t tied the pieces together so much until I listened to my mother’s
tapes shortly before she died about what she did to realize how all of these
things feed together, and as I get more perspective about what life is and
how my life has worked out, and it’s worked out in interesting different ways.
But this was a seminal experience. And Lucy Mitchell, who I had known
when I almost didn’t—I mean I had been interviewed by her about going to
Bank Street, and had been accepted at Bank Street if Dick had gone to
Columbia. But then she moved out—she retired out here. She was the first
Dean of Women at UC Berkeley at the age of twenty-five. You should
read—if you want a really interesting book, it’s a book called Two Lives
about her and her husband, Wesley Clair Mitchell, the economist. And it’s
absolutely fascinating. I reread it recently. It’s called Two Lives, and it’s
Lucy Sprague Mitchell. And it deals with his growing up and her growing up,
which is a fascinating historical study. He grew up in the rural Midwest, and
she grew up in Chicago in an affluent family. And how they made the
connections, and what they did with their lives, and how incredibly
reinforcing they were to each other. Marvelous relationship. But she lived in
a little tiny house over here on Forest Street or something, under a huge oak

81

tree. And when my mother first came out here to visit us, she took me over
to see Lucy with the kids. And the kids were mesmerized by her. She had
such a knack of getting with kids, any ages. She was wonderful.
Wise: But was she working in Berkeley and commuting from here?
Lyman: [01:13:48] No, no, no.
Wise: Oh, later when she was older.
Lyman: [01:13:53] This was when we were here. And so it would have been in the
early ‘60s. And what happened was she moved in here [Channing House] in
the first group of residents that moved in, and very soon after she moved in,
she managed to set herself on fire—the bed on fire by smoking in her bed.
This was one of the reasons why they outlawed all smoking, thank God. But
all her beloved books, which she had selected to bring with her here were
smoke-damaged. They weren’t burnt, but they were smoke-damaged. And
Holly would come over after school a couple of times a week and put new
spines with tape on the back of her books and put the titles on each one.
And in the meantime, this was when I was lost, and one of the things that
happened—I said I don’t know what to do with myself. And she said, “Well,
can you write?” And I said, “Well, not very well. I’ve always had trouble
with writing.” So she gave me a one-on-one tutorial. Each week I would go
to see her, and she would give me an assignment to write about something.
And then she would critique it. She was brutally efficient, and marvelous,
and so nice about it. I mean, I say she was brutally efficient because she
really got to the heart of everything. But it was such a treasure, and to the

82

extent that I then became a reasonable writer. Partly it’s Dick, and partly it’s
Lucy.
Wise: Right. But you were motivated, obviously.
Lyman: [01:16:53] Yes.
Wise: I mean you could easily have said, hey, I don’t need this.
Lyman: [01:16:57] Yes. Right. No, no, no. And it was just such a treasure to be able
to have that time with her as a one-on-one. And it was a treasure for her,
too. I became her eyes and ears. She had a son and a daughter-in-law and
grandchildren here. But they were too close. And so we became sort of an
alternative family for her. This was a wonderful relationship that she and I
had. But she also had it with our kids. And it was just very special. And I
would come and see her fairly frequently even as she deteriorated. But I
remember after—this is quite fascinating—after the No on 14 thing, I went
to see her and she said—and her terminology was wrong, but you
understood what she was saying. She said, “Okay, you know, you’re a
[manager]. What are you going to do with it?”
Wise: What do you find mistaken about that terminology?
Lyman: [01:18:16] That it was much more than [managing]. What I am is a classic
networker, that I can put people together. My strength has always been, in
all these things I’ve done, was to bring people together who wouldn’t
normally be talking to each other, and make it possible for them to hear each
other, and get somewhere that they didn’t think they could get because of
that. And that’s what I was doing in a sense—even with the campaign in
getting these precinct workers to get out there and make a case for

83

something that they didn’t know they believed until they had to talk about it.
But then we had to reorganize into Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair Housing.
And we had five thousand dollars left in our campaign fund. And we made a
board, and then we made me executive director. And we took an office on
the corner of University Avenue and Bryant Street. No. It is the last one
down. That isn’t Bryant. It’s the next one down. Is it Emerson? No. What
is it? High street.
Wise: Oh, High.
Lyman: [01:19:48] High Street. It became a bookstore, and I don’t know what it is
now. But on the second floor there, we had these two rooms. And we had
one telephone and two offices. So we had a twenty-five foot cord. The
person who was the volunteer secretary would answer the phone, and if it
was for me, she’d bring the telephone in to me in my office.
Wise: And were you getting a salary?
Lyman: [01:20:28] Well, I said I wanted to be paid. And then we discovered that, in
those days, if I got a salary, even though it was a volunteer job, I had to
declare income. Well, you don’t have to do that anymore. But you did then.
Wise: Well, it was volunteer. But if you wanted a salary, it wouldn’t have been
volunteer then.
Lyman: [01:21:05] Well, it was because of the way it was set up. And I can’t tell you
what it was. But in any case, I was so mad. I said I’d rather work for
nothing than have to pay income tax on something where I’m essentially
contributing my time. And—
Wise: Oh, yes. So they were taxing your time really.

84

Lyman: [01:21:29] They were taxing my time, and I was working all hours of the day
and night. I mean it was just huge.
Wise: Well, it was the—it was Midpeninsula—
Lyman: [01:21:39] Citizens for Fair Housing.
Wise: That’s right.
Lyman: [01:21:41] And MCFH is it. And it’s sort of still alive, but it’s now
incorporated in another organization. But it was quite an amazing
experience.
Wise: And so once the fire was lit, you just went for it.
Lyman: [01:22:03] I went. And I organized that. But then in ’66, I took a leave of
absence because Dick had a sabbatical leave and we took all the kids and
went to Europe. And he was now being wooed by several institutions,
including Haverford College at that point. And when we came back from
this leave, we stopped at Haverford. They were offering him a job. And he
was very taken. His father also died at that moment, too, and it was
traumatic. But we came back here very uncertain about what was going to
happen. And I had taken this leave of absence. In the meantime, he had
been offered a job at Washington University to take over as Dean of Arts
and Sciences by Tom Eliot. And we decided that we had left Washington
University and we didn’t need to go back there again. And besides, to me,
this was where I belonged. And, again, I’m blocking on the then Dean of
Arts and Sciences here, of Humanity and Sciences here. But he said, “If you
want to find out what administration is like, I’m going to have an associate
deanship coming up very shortly. Why don’t you hang on and I’ll give you

85

that.” [Editor: Psychologist Robert Sears served as Dean the School of
Humanities and Sciences from 1961 to 1970.]
Wise: Would he have had an administrative position at Haverford?
Lyman: [01:23:59] Pardon?
Wise: At Haverford?
Lyman: [01:24:01] This was before the Haverford thing came up.
Wise: Oh, I see. I see.
Lyman: [01:24:04] This was in ‘64 or so. In ’64, he became an Associate Dean of
Humanities and Sciences. I think it was in ‘64. May even have been in ‘63.
It was probably ‘64 because when we got back from this sabbatical Joel
Smith, who was then Dean of Students, was talking to Dick and said have
you told Wally that [you are planning on going to Haverford]—because at
that point, we were prepared to go to Haverford.
Wise: Oh, my goodness.
Lyman: [01:24:57] And Joel said, have you told Wally Sterling that this is what you’re
doing? And Dick said, “Well, I did talk to him earlier about it, but”—he
said, “Well, you better make sure he understands this.” And within hours
practically Wally said, “I need to talk to you.” In the meantime, I don’t know
how we began talking with Herb Packer in the Law School—oh, I know.
Wally said, “I would like to make one of you provost and one of you vice
provost, but I’m going to have a fight over Herb Packer because he has the
reputation among the board of this radical person.” He had written a book
that had upset everybody. And Dick can give you the details on this. But
anyway, the end result of all of this was that we—Nancy Packer and Herb,

86

and Dick and I, and Robert McAfee Brown as our counselor, sat around our
living room and debated this. Wally said, “I’d like to offer the provostship to
you and you guys can decide how you’re going to work it out. Herb wanted
to do the Study of Education at Stanford so they worked it out that Dick
would be the provost.7 This doesn’t get into all the complexities, which is in
his book. Have you read his book?
Wise: I’m about half way through.
Lyman: [01:26:43] Yes. Because he deals with all of that stuff there, and his side of
that. But believe me, it was something. And to hang in there and be
available. And—one of the things that happened in my life as a result of all
of this was finding out how to balance his needs with my needs and my
activities, which were still local at that point, although they were beginning to
branch out for a whole lot of reasons. And the fact that I got my first
Rosenberg Grant in—I think ‘64, but maybe not. Maybe it was later than
that. I can’t remember. No, it may have been in ‘66—for Fair Housing
activity with the California Real Estate Association. This was after the
passage of Prop 14, and we were trying to find a way to educate the real
estate industry on how to sell to minority clients. It was a community
initiative to do that. Again, finding ways to bring people across barriers
together. But for the moment, the focus was on what was happening with
According to Richard W. Lyman, the offer for him to return to Washington University to be Dean
there came in ‘62 or ‘63. Lyman turned it down because Dean Sears said he should stay at Stanford,
not because Sears would be appointing an associate dean but merely because opportunities to try
administration were bound to arise sooner or later. As it turned out, a year later it was an
appointment as Associate Dean of Humanities & Sciences that came up. Haverford's presidency was
three years later; [their] visit there was in the fall of 1966. It was the Haverford presidency that the
Lymans decided Richard Lyman should take that triggered his appointment as Provost, effective
January 1, 1967.

7

87

Dick. And in the end, he turns Haverford down and said, yes, he would
stay—this was if they would hire Herb, too, he would stay. If they weren’t
going to hire Herb, he was going to Haverford.
Wise: To get back to my one question before, was the Haverford position also
administrative?
Lyman: [01:28:38] It was the presidency.
Wise: Oh, it was the president.
Lyman: [01:28:41] Yes.
Wise: Oh, well, yes, I would say.
Lyman: [01:28:44] Well, yes, except that it was—as we stopped on our way west to
visit Gil White, who had been the president of Haverford, and he said, “Well,
if you don’t mind being waked up at one o’clock in the morning because a
faculty wife has a plumbing problem, this is the job for you.” That wasn’t
exactly reassuring, shall we say. But you have to understand, this was also
our old stamping ground.
Wise: It was. Right down the street.
Lyman: [01:29:16] Right. So there were a lot of pluses and minuses. But it was
clear—and the more we both thought about it, the more we realized [Dick]
was a big institution person, not a little institution person—that that wasn’t
going to work, that he needed the stimulus of the multiple aspects of a larger
institution.
Wise: Yes, because he’d had that at Washington University.

88

Lyman: [01:29:46] Well, yes, he’d got his taste of that then. And he’d begun to move
up in the academic activity side of that. So this was a logical step. And of
course, when he took over in ‘67, the roof was beginning to fly off.
Wise: As provost, you mean.
Lyman: [01:30:12] Yes.
Wise: Yes. Now, how did the kids fit into your working around the clock?
Lyman: [01:30:19] Well, one of the things was that because he [Dick] had an
academic schedule, and because he was an only child, he had always wanted
to be actively involved with his children. He changed diapers, he fed babies,
in the early years. I’m not a morning person. I don’t speak to anybody in the
morning if I can avoid it until I’ve had something to eat. And he learned—I
mean, we all learned, that I would get up and feed the current baby, and the
baby and I would go back to bed, and he would feed the other kids. First,
there was one, and then there were two, and then there were three. And he
would get them off to school. And he would often be there when they came
home from school, if he didn’t have a meeting. If he did, we—that’s where
we got to know Sharon Giles, now Beamer, because we had this stream of
wonderful students and because he had a connection—we would go to eat in
the dorms and cultivate students who would be good babysitters. We never
had a problem. And then we were also part of something which we’d never
experienced before, which was a babysitting pool. They didn’t have those
anywhere else in the world at that point.
Wise: Oh, really?
Lyman: [01:31:47] As far as we were concerned, this was a Stanford area experience.

89

Wise: My mom was in one in Marin.
Lyman: [01:31:57] Well, maybe it was a California thing.
Wise: California, or Bay Area.
Lyman: [01:32:00] I don’t know. But it certainly wasn’t in the East and it made so
much sense. For the most part, he was the one who would go out and babysit. So he’d had a lot of experience with working with kids. And it was
invaluable, both in his administration, but in his dealing with his kids. And
the classic, classic case of this, thank God, when Cricket—well, both of the
boys did a maverick thing at school, as school age persons. They both
graduated a year early from high school. Cricket went and spent three
months on our island off the coast of Maine with our dog by himself in the
fall. And it was a real challenge. Then, because he had met Jane Goodall at
our house, she invited him to come out to Gombe [Editor: Jane Goodall
worked at the Gombe Stream Game Reserve in Tanzania] as a seventeenyear-old. And he did that. Boy, I want to tell you, that was a mind-boggling
experience for a seventeen year old, because he hit the tropics, he hit Africa,
he hit scientific exploration, he hit everything—boom. And disease. He had
everything. He had all sorts of bacteria in him when he came back. But it
was a mind-blowing experience. Tim graduated a year early. Tim was the
one who was acutely dyslexic and had himself, at our expense, tutored in
Serbo-Croatian because he had apprenticed himself to one of the folkdance
troupes up in the city, a volunteer folkdance troupe, and been smitten with
the Yugoslav folk dancing. So he had himself tutored in Serbo-Croatian by a
graduate student—or rather his wife, here at Stanford, and earned money by

90

working in the [PsycheDeli] to pay for his transportation to Yugoslavia. The
then Consul-General and his wife in Zagreb were longtime friends of ours,
who now live here in Palo Alto, and whom we adore. And they took him
under their wing and introduced him to the whole of the country, and to
people to get to know and to stay with so that he traveled all over
Yugoslavia—for a pittance, and lived with a Belgrade family, and apprenticed
himself to the National Folkdance Troupe. And did that for a year. Came
back, earned some more money, and went back for a second summer, and
ended up going to Harvard. When he found out he could go to Yale where
the three others had gone, then he went to Harvard, as a nineteen-year-old
freshman. So he’d taken two years out.
Wise: Oh, right. But one was an early graduation year though?
Lyman: [01:35:47] Yes. So he was only one year behind. But he came in with a
group of kids. They were the last group of students [to live as freshmen in a
multi-class dorm at Radcliffe --- men and women]. I, in the meantime, was
serving on the visiting committee to Harvard and Radcliffe for the
undergraduate program. And it pretty soon became both the graduate and
the undergraduate program because of the way they were changing their
curriculum, and the graduate students were so much involved in a whole
tutorial of the undergraduates that it all got sort of into one big ball of wax.
But they made the decision, and I fought, bled, and almost died over this, to
go into an all-freshman dorm situation. So Tim was in the last class of
students who lived at Radcliffe, if they wanted to, outside the freshman dorm
and they lived in a four-class environment. For older kids, this was what

91

made sense. And a lot of his bosom-beaus, whom he still sees on a regular
basis, were part of that group who lived at Radcliffe that year. And I, in the
meantime, was using these kids unmercifully. Because I wasn’t on campus
the way a lot of the other visiting committee people were often, I had to get
sort of up-to-speed on what our agenda for the current meeting was. So I
would come in a day early and—first, I’d just use faculty brats, and then
when Tim went, I used him to organize a group of students for me to talk to
about these issues that I was supposed to be hearing about with the canned
students that were presented to us in the meetings.
Wise: You were probably getting a more honest view.
Lyman: [01:37:43] I was getting a different perspective, shall we say. [coughs and
laughs] How honest it was, I never was quite sure. But it was fun and I had a
ball.

Interview Session Three
September 15, 2010

(misc.)
Wise: I just want to pick up briefly, to ask how Dick’s appointment to provost
affected your work at the time.
Lyman: I was actively involved with MCFH [Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair Housing]
at that point. But what it mainly allowed me to do was to be active with the
Faculty Women’s Club. In starting, we moved. We had been living down on
Salvatierra Street and then the opportunity to buy this incredible house up on
San Juan Hill that was—five bedrooms and four baths, or something? I can’t
even remember. No, it was seven bedrooms, because there were three little
bedrooms back in a servants’ quarters that the kids used. Jenny used that—
one of them was over the garages and was a wonderful bird’s nest room.
Then the boys, Cricket took a suite. He had an up-and-down suite. Then
Tim had a room over in the main body of the house. So, each had a lot of
independence.
Wise: Was this available because he was provost, or—?
Lyman: [00:02:12] No—
Wise: No, just coincidental?
Lyman: [00:02:13] It was just that the Croskofs—Connie Croskof [Editor: Konrad
Krauskopf, known as “Konnie”, is a geology professor and pioneer in the
field of geochemisty.] who had owned it, they had bought it for a pittance
because it had been business—it was up on what was known as Business Hill
that was all Business School people. The former Dean of the Business
93

School had owned this house—this huge house. Absolutely gorgeous. It’s
shaped like a horseshoe with this living room hanging off one end. It had a
double lot and it just went down into the little creek that went through the
divide there between Gerona Road and Mayfield. It was a perfect site
because it was very protected. There were four houses. Really, three houses
actually on the circle. You drove up this little street. Gerona went along the
backside of the campus and then took a little bend. Do you remember that
before it went back into Mayfield?
Wise: I don’t. I’d have to check that out.
Lyman: [00:03:20] It was a thing like this. If you look at the maps, you’ll see it. This
is just a little cul-de-sac that came up off of that short leg of Gerona Road.
You came up the hill, and then into this lovely little circle with a tree in the
middle of it. Then this house with this huge blue spruce, right in front of it
which is unfortunately no longer there, but it was out here. So that the front
steps came up here. There was a big front hall, and then a dining room, and
then the kitchen area out here with this—with kids' little rooms over here
and then three rooms across the front of the house. Then a bathroom and a
long—my God—a long little attic—there was a crawl-through space in this
bathroom that went out over this wing. We had the downstairs. There was a
beautiful glassed-in patio room, looking on this courtyard and the courtyard
was bricked-in with four little plane trees that were pollarded so that they
made little green umbrellas. The sun came [00:05:02] and just warmed up that
whole patio. So you could eat out there even after dark because it kept it
warm. It was absolutely amazing. We adored the house. We could hardly

94

bear—we didn’t want to give it up. When we sold it, Dick said he’d never go
back there again because he was just so disappointed to lose it.
Wise: I guess the one downside was you left that family that was right next door.
Remember? You had a family of four kids—?
Lyman: [00:05:32] Oh, yes. Well, but they had already left. [The Peases had moved to
Seattle].
Wise: Oh, they’d already left.
Lyman: [00:05:36] Otis had gone up to the University of Washington. So we had
new neighbors there, and that was all right. We had wonderful neighbors in
the other half of our house, whom we adored. Did you take history?
Wise: Some.
Lyman: [00:05:53] Did you take any Japanese history?
Wise: Mm-mmm.
Lyman: [00:05:57] Tom Smith was our next door neighbor, and his wife, Jeanne, and
their two kids. And that was fine. We just had good relations with the other
half of the wall.
Wise: [laughs]
Lyman: [00:06:08] Jeanne used to say—I would say to her, “Jeanne, I hope we don’t
make so much noise that it will bother you.” And she [laughs] would say,
“No it doesn’t bother us at all, except that I don’t understand what all that
sound of moving furniture is.”
Wise: [laughs]
Lyman: [00:06:24] And I said, [laughs] “Well that’s just little boys coming down the
stairs.” [laughter] Then she said, “And who ever stops to listen in your

95

family?” [laughter] Which was a very appropriate question. [laughs]
Everybody was [laughs] going all the time.
Wise: Right, right. Six extroverts. [laughs]
Lyman: [00:06:43] Yes. That was our house on Salvatierra Street. Then we moved
up to El Escarpado and this wonderful house with a courtyard. That’s where
we, God, we had a reception for Bob Sears, who was going out as Dean of
Humanities and Sciences and Al Hastorf, who was coming in. And there was
an announcement made in White Plaza that day, that if you wanted to do
something to get at the Lymans, they were having this party at our house.
The thing to do was to come up and picket. There was obviously not
parking up there—so people had to park down and around Gerona Road
and then walk up this little cul-de-sac—up the sleeve into the cul-de-sac.
And [00:07:56] they lined both sides of that little sleeve. Poor Ken Pitzer,
[the then newly appointed president,] had to walk up there. And they were
just vile. They were really vile. But the advantage of this was that when we
got people inside the front door, it was as though they, [the hasslers], didn’t
exist. The only trouble was [what that identification of our home] led to—
and I can’t remember the exact sequence, but within a week or so—I had just
had the kitchen completely redone. It was absolutely spic and span clean.
Dick was down on campus until an ungodly hour, came home, and our dog
had had puppies, our Golden Retriever. We finally got rid of all the puppies,
and then one puppy came back. [takes a sip of drink] And it cried, and
cried, and cried, all evening long. Then Dick came home about 2. And we
had had a security guard in the house, right from the beginning.

96

Wise:

So Dick was a target?

Lyman: [00:09:16] Yes. Very much a target.
Wise: Even though, I mean, because, for the party, they were obviously heckling
Ken Pitzer, but it sounds like—
Lyman: [00:09:22] Well no. It was Dick—he was the major target.
Wise: How did he become a target so quickly?
Lyman: [00:09:29] He was in a position—you know, there was an announcement
when he was made provost.
Wise: I mean, had he done anything?
Lyman: [00:09:38] One of the ringleaders of this disruption, although he won’t admit
that, was Bart Bernstein in the History Department.
Wise: No!
Lyman: [00:09:48] He had made the announcement at White Plaza that we were
having this event that afternoon.
Wise: But he hadn’t made any decisions, he hadn’t taken any actions that people—?
Lyman: [00:10:00] Not yet, no.
Wise: —that people were protesting, right?
Lyman: [00:10:03] Not really. I mean, it was the Military Industrial Complex kind of
thing. I’ll tell you more about that a little bit later. We were inside this place,
and then about a week later, when Dick got back after 2 in the morning, and
we were just comparing notes. Suddenly, there was this loud crash. And
[laughs] the security guard had come in to get a cup of coffee. Fortunately,
the way the kitchen was designed, they threw one of those huge Coke
bottles—demonstration Coke bottles—of red paint through the kitchen

97

windows. It splattered all over everything. You can’t imagine what a mess
this thing made. It was broken glass, and—
Wise: Oh, God!
Lyman: [00:11:02] —oil paint. The Whites, who bought the house from us
eventually, until they finally redid the kitchen, there were still scars on the
cabinets from where this glass hit, way across the room from the window
that it came through but was in some ways much more serious because at 2,
you don’t expect anybody to be in the kitchen. Except of course, [laughs]
the security guard—poor man. He was behind the pillar. So he [00:11:44]
did not get hit. But he also didn’t have any idea who had done this. What
we found out the next morning was that they had thrown two big rocks
through the sewing room window up on the second floor. Well, it was four
feet from the [back] of Holly’s bed. But there was a wall in between. I
mean, she wasn’t in jeopardy, but they didn’t know that! They didn’t know
somebody wasn’t sleeping out there. And it was, you know, it was just
unconscionable. It really was. That was the same night that they had the fire
up at the Behavioral Sciences Center, and somebody lost all his writing. His
years of work, of writing, was just destroyed in the fire.
Wise: Just very thoughtless.
Lyman: [00:12:42] It was. There was so much of that sort of thing. That was just
random stuff. Well, we went through the whole Bruce Franklin thing, and—
Wise: Did you have to stop doing as much of—?
Lyman: [00:13:03] No. No.
Wise: —what you were doing because of—?

98

Lyman: [00:13:04] I just went on doing what I was doing.
Wise: You did?
Lyman: [00:13:07] Because to the extent that I could do things without losing the
ability to be with Dick and to go to the events, you know, one of the things
we did was that we went on going to dinners in the dorms and so forth.
Usually what happened was that it would be fine to begin with. What we
found very interesting was that the students who wanted to talk with Dick
were often the transfer students, who had a better sense of the value of what
Stanford had to offer. So they were doing that. And it just—it worked. But
then, almost inevitably, as soon as the word got out that we were there, this
cluster of the same people would come and they would ask [00:14:12] these
absolutely incessant, stupid questions. He would answer them carefully, and
thoughtfully. And he would come home and he would say, “I don’t know
why I’m doing this night after night. This is really stupid.” I said, “You're
doing it for the benefit of all of those people who sit around the edges and
have to hear those coherent, cogent answers.” It made a big difference. It
really did. The very fact that we kept doing it—and then he began doing the
KZSU broadcasts—weekly broadcasts. And [laughs] Bob Byers—God bless
him—and our son Cricket, who was then, well, he was 15 to 16. He
[Cricket] took it upon himself to be Dick’s bodyguard. So, he always went
with him. In a funny way, that was a relief and it also—because he had
connections with [00:15:21] some of these people. He would go to all of
these meetings until finally, we said, you know, “Maybe you’d better not

99

because you're a target yourself.” He understood that. It was not easy. But
he did it.
Wise: I guess Dick’s choice would’ve been to just pull back and hole up.
Lyman: [00:15:47] Oh, yes.
Wise: To hide.
Lyman: [00:15:48] But that’s what Ken Pitzer did. Ken Pitzer had one confrontation.
After that, he went out of his way to avoid anything that would be a
confrontation. He just wasn’t there. I mean, he was there, but—they holed
him up at the Hoover House, and that was it. They didn’t do, really,
entertaining because if you did entertaining, you were a sitting target, as we
found out. Then after [Dick] was appointed president, this was in
September. We tried to live in [our own] house on El Escarpado [coughs],
and use the Hoover House just for entertainment. But I found inevitably,
[00:16:55] whatever it was I needed was at the other place. I also [laughs]
had this bright idea that I would change caterers every time we had an event
so that we gave our business broadly in the community. I [laughs] discovered
that what happened was that every time we had another caterer, more of our
stuff disappeared. So I finally settled on one caterer. Besides which, she
learned to do the things I wanted to do. I planned all the menus, she just did
all the work.
Wise: Then at this point, when he was president, did you then spend a good
portion of your time being—?
Lyman: [00:17:39] I went right on doing all the other things.
Wise: You did? How did you find time for that?

100

Lyman: [00:17:43] Well, [laughs] it just—that’s the way it was. The kids were in high
school, and we just, you know, I traveled with him when he traveled, and I
just worked my schedule out. I remember [laughs] Coline—did you ever
know Coline Cuthbertson? Kenny Cuthbertson’s wife?
Wise: No, I don’t think so.
Lyman: [00:18:05] Coline was a pistol. She was the most outspoken, warmhearted,
effusive creature you could imagine. But she decided that it was
inappropriate for me to do all these things outside of the university. I came
back from a trip and they were putting up some kind of a reception at the
Faculty Club. I came down the stairs in time for the tail end of this thing.
And she had this stentorian voice. For the benefit of everybody in the room,
she just took off on me. [laughs] Poor Ken, I thought he was going to die.
But that was [00:18:56] just Coline. It was hurtful. It was very hurtful. But,
fortunately, I was able to see it for what it was. She had physical disabilities
and couldn’t do the things that she’d like to do. They had four kids. She’d
raised her kids, and she’d made a point of being his spouse. Yet, she was an
activist-minded kind of person. And I think she couldn’t quite bear it.
[00:19:37] But, you know, that’s all right. Takes all kinds. And she was
wonderful for him.
Wise: Now, what were you doing at this point?
Lyman: [00:19:50] Well, while Dick was provost, I helped Yvette Gurley, and I can’t
remember who else, who started the Job Opportunities in Continuing
Education. That was what did the two little booklets. The Going Into

Labor, and the Job Opportunities booklets that the Faculty Women’s Club
101

did. Going Into Labor was the one that had that [laughs] wonderful picture
on the front of the White House fence with everybody strapped to the fence,
chained to the fence. And one—we loved this—[laughs] one of the middle
banners said, “Swarthmore College.”
Wise: [laughs]
Lyman: [00:20:49] And the other one said “Stanford!” [laughs] It just felt, just
absolutely right. I thought it was hysterical. I mean, here they were chained
to the fence with these great big grins on their faces, and their fur boas,
and—
Wise: [laughs]
Lyman: [00:21:05] You know. [laughs] And the great big hats [laughs]. It was a
wonderful picture, if you could ever get a copy of it. It would be a great
picture to include with this because it was just—
Wise: So you edited or wrote the booklets, or—?
Lyman: [00:21:21] No, I worked with the people who worked on it. There were a
whole bunch of people. With Job Opportunities, we put an
announcement—Anne Miner, who was then working in the Development
Office, put an announcement in The Daily, I guess it was, saying that if
anybody, any faculty wife was interested in this, we were going to have a
planning session at our house to talk about what to do.
Wise: Were these job opportunities for people in the community?
Lyman: [00:22:02] No. These were job opportunities for faculty wives.
Wise: Wow!
Lyman: [00:22:06] Exclusively. Or faculty and staff wives.

102

Wise: Wow.
Lyman: [00:22:10] And then, Continuing Education opportunities for faculty and
staff wives because the university had had an adamant rule that you could not
take classes if you were a spouse. Of course, all the spouses in those days
were women.
Wise: So, let’s back up a little and then get into the Faculty Wives. And we’ll get to
this. Was this what brought you into the Faculty Wives organization?
Lyman: [00:22:42] No, I’d been active in it. In fact, I even thought—well, I might
share it. But I’d been also active in the Palo Alto school district. And I had
thought maybe I would run for Palo Alto school district board. Fortunately,
a wonderful woman named Aggie Robinson, who was a sort of doyenne,
took me aside and said, “You’re not ready for this. Do some other things
first.” That’s what got me started with the Faculty Wives, although I’d been
a faculty wife active with the Faculty Wives. [Editor: N.J. Robinson who
went by “Aggie” was an activist in many causes on the Peninsula, including
the PTA, school board, various health organizations and community college
boards.]
Wise: You had been since he was a professor, because you were a faculty wife,
right?
Lyman: [00:23:27] Yes, I was. Sure. I mean, this was a perfectly legitimate thing for
me to be doing.
Wise: But then, did you move into a leadership role when he became provost?
Lyman: [00:23:36] Yes. That’s when I organized this—well, I invited people to come
to our house. And 50, “5-0” people showed up. We were just staggered. It

103

turned out that people were desperate for this kind of opportunity, either to
do Continuing Education, or to get into jobs. And that’s what led to the
starting of the Resource Center for Women. That’s why—and it was a
session put on by Helen—I mean, Jane Fairbank and Helen Bryson, who did
a daylong session on job opportunities for women in the Bay Area.
Wise: Oh, in the Bay Area? Not just at Stanford—?
Lyman: [00:24:38] Yes, right. And they had a land office turnout for that.
Wise: Now, wait a minute. She was doing it for people outside the Faculty Wives,
or—?
Lyman: [00:24:49] Well, it turned out it was wives outside the faculty. But mainly, it
started out to be focused on faculty wives.
Wise: Faculty wives’ opportunities outside—
Lyman: [00:25:02] Yes, anywhere.
Wise: —everywhere in the Bay Area?
Lyman: [00:25:03] Yes.
Wise: I see. Okay. But it included—
Lyman: [00:25:08] They had a daylong session with revolving people presenting and
then a lunch at the Faculty Club for everybody who was a participant. And
they had to turn people away. Then they had sessions—repeat sessions in
the afternoon so that people could do two different things.
Wise: The daylong session included people other than faculty wives?
Lyman: [00:25:40] Yes. But it was started with the faculty wives and then—
Wise: Got larger.

104

Lyman: [00:25:45] —accepted people from the community. And everybody, I mean,
the women just turned out in droves! Literally. It was so successful that—it
was the five women who set that all up who started the Resource Center for
Women. I put on a luncheon for them—for the five of them—to talk about
this to people like Lucile Packard, and [Ellie] Heller. Why do I forget her
first name? Ellie Heller, who was a trustee of Berkeley and lived in Atherton,
and was very much interested in Stanford. I think I had about seven or eight
women of substance.
Wise: Now, was this a precursor to CROW?
Lyman: [00:26:52] No. This [The Resource Center for Women] was the community
piece. CROW was the university piece. That was going on simultaneously,
so that I was working “both sides of the street,” if you want.
Wise: Right. Because the focus of CROW was more research, right?
Lyman: [00:27:09] Yes, very much so.
Wise: And then this was more a center—?
Lyman: [00:27:11] And it [CROW] was academic. And that was just for people at
Stanford. Although what became the Wednesday luncheons, bag luncheons
that were put on by CROW, actually drew, they drew hugely staff. Staff.
Women. But they also drew community people. And when we began—we
talked with Rosemary Young, Mrs. John Young—and we had a luncheon for
her again at Hoover House about how to design an outreach program to
women in the community. That became the Friends of CROW, or whatever
they were called. Rosemary organized all of that, and arranged to have these
salons, about once a month, in various homes around the community to have

105

faculty report to them, and particularly faculty women. Those were hugely
successful. It was so interesting, because I always remember particularly Nan
Keohane, who was young and just coming out of her shell a little bit. But
very academically focused. And she presented. She gave an absolutely
fabulous report. Her whole attitude was as though she were [00:29:06]
talking to these wet-behind-the-ears creatures. The fact that all these women
were sitting around listening to this, and then she opened it up for Q and A,
and they began asking her questions. Her whole mindset—you could just see
it change. Right there in front of your eyes. She was blown away by the
depth and thoughtfulness of the kinds of questions they were asking her.
She had had no interest whatsoever in the Faculty Women’s Club, or in
CROW, or anything else. She’d been focused on “Nan Keohane doing her
academic piece.” And it transformed her. I mean, that, plus [her] initial
exposure, and then her increasing involvement. She ended up being Chair of
CROW. [laughs] [00:30:13] It was just so wonderful to see these things
happen.
Wise: This sounds like a transformation of the Faculty Wives, as well.
Lyman: [00:30:44] Oh yes, absolutely. It brought people out of the woodwork.
People who had never been involved with the Faulty Wives showed up as
part of these 50 people.
Wise: Let’s just set the scene, though. Before this, what kinds of things did the
Faculty Wives do?
Lyman: [00:31:04] They did very nice things. But they were all social. They had the
wine tastings, and they had the dancing groups, and they had the—same

106

thing they do now. They had the luncheons, and the fashion shows, and so
forth. But they didn’t have an awful lot of substance. The reading groups
did and the language groups did. But they were very specialized. What this
did was to give a chance to the women who were essentially academics, but
had been run out of the club because they made the decision to move [with
their spouses who had the appointment]—or had never [arrived]. Then we
established [laughs] something that we started calling, initially, “The 10
Bodies” and [00:32:01] realized that we couldn’t go with that because that
was so—[laughs] not acceptable. But they were 10 women who were
returnees who wanted to go back in as undergraduates. And the university
said, “No way.” Then, thanks to [laughs] Dick, they began to say, “Well, let’s
have a trial run.” Of course, these people were spectacular. [laughs] They set
the whole ball rolling and it just went from there. You can’t imagine—
Wise: So they had had to just stomp out—?
Lyman: [00:32:40] I mean, it was people like Sue Bell, who became a mainstay of
CROW and the research that was being done there, was one of these people.
She had never—because she married early [00:33:08]—she was just never
allowed [to matriculate]. Dick tried to go to bat for her with the History
Department and they would have none of it. I mean, you can’t imagine how
sexist!
Wise: Oh, I can. [laughs]
Lyman: [00:33:24] Yes, well. But it’s hard in today’s world, even though it’s still
there, it’s so incredibly different.
Wise: So this just revolutionized—?

107

Lyman: [00:33:37] This was revolutionizing the whole concept of women’s roles in
academia.
Wise: Also, it sounds like you found people who hadn’t been active in the Faculty
Wives.
Lyman: [00:33:50] Oh, yes! I mean—
Wise: —you brought out new people altogether—
Lyman: [00:33:53] Absolutely! Absolutely. And that, in turn, snowballed. So that’s
what sort of led to CROW, and to the Resource Center for Women. One,
being on campus and one being off campus. What I used to say is,
“Resource Center is for women, and CROW is about women.” I used to
have to explain to people how I could do both, because people shoved them
together in their minds. That wasn’t good.
Wise: Did you stay active this way throughout Dick’s time as president?
Lyman: [00:34:32] Yes. Then, these Wednesday lectures. Peter Bing, bless his
heart—I guess it was about the time that Dick retired—gave an endowment,
a temporary endowment, for those Wednesday lectures that became the Jing
Lyman lectures. And [laughs] I remember Bill Bowen, who had been
provost when Dick was provost, and then president of Princeton when Dick
was, and was then—I can’t think of his foundation [Lyman: Andrew Mellon
Foundation]. But anyway, he was out here. He was a board member of the
Behavioral Sciences Center. He was [00:35:20] out here for something in
lecturing. He was part of a panel of lecturers. He [laughs] went over to
CROW to use the restroom, and walked in. Here was this big poster. He
came back absolutely doubled up with laughter. He said, “I’ve just seen a

108

poster that says ‘Sexual Life in Jing Lyman,’ ‘Jing Lyman in Sexual Life,’” or
something like that. [laughs]
Wise: [laughs]
Lyman: [00:35:46] I can’t remember, but it was a very odd juxtaposition, it’s difficult.
Wise: That’s funny.
Lyman: [00:35:51] He was absolutely convulsed with laughter. They had it posted in
the bathroom. But those were wonderful lectures, you know? And they're
coming back, which is fun. They're only coming back once a month, or
something like that, or once a quarter. [Lyman: Once a year.] But they are
coming back. Now, where do we go from here?
Wise: [00:36:26] Okay. I’m going to transition to domestic duties. In the Winter
1995 newsletter of The Institute for Research on Women and Gender, you
were quoted as saying you knew nothing about the role of First Lady.
Lyman: [00:36:48] [laughs] God, that’s so right.
Wise: You were coached by the House Manager at Hoover House. I wanted to
hear about that and get the name of the House Manager, and all of that.
Lyman: [00:36:58] Paul Nakajo, N-A-K-A-J-O.
Wise: N-A-K-A-J-O. Okay.
Lyman: [00:37:05] He had a Japanese first name, but I never could—he was always
Paul as far as we were concerned. He had come to Hoover House as a short
order cook when one of [the Sterling] daughters was getting married. I can’t
remember who it was—which one, but he had come in, and had just worked
very well. So Anne hired him, and he was known in the faculty directory as
“Houseboy.”

109

Wise: [gasps loudly]
Lyman: [00:37:45] If you will. I didn’t even know that. Here I was in this position
of—a Japanese man for whom I was the boss, but I didn’t know the job.
Wise: Yes. That’s tough.
Lyman: [00:38:04] He was three inches, at least, shorter than I. There was just this
very difficult friction between us because he had to teach me. He had now
become, in effect, the House Manager. He had worked for the Pitzers, he
and two staff people had had a whole slew of house people and, plus
students. We had students who lived in a garage apartment. They had been,
traditionally, business school students. That changed under our aegis. They
were other things [00:38:53], including a medical school student and his wife.
It was this tiny apartment where they both lived. This was in return for
helping with parties. What we did was to make a decision that—the only
outside help we would have for parties would be a caterer and any staff that
she brought with her. Students worked all the parties. They were the
bartenders, and that was interesting, because I insisted that the bartenders
could also be women as well as men. And for Paul— that was a stab in the
heart. That was his—male prerogative was to do the drinks. Well, he had to
learn. [coughs] But it [00:39:52] didn’t change—I’ll tell you what changed
it—our relationship. We went through that whole first year from September
until July sometime, I think, with this uneasy balance. Then, we [Dick and
Jing] went, courtesy of the foundation, to a session in Japan, in Nara, which
is the old capital—of Japan. What am I trying to—all of a sudden I’m

110

blocking out the name of the city next to it, which is where all the beautiful
gardens are. [Lyman: Kyoto]
Wise: So you and Dick went on this—?
Lyman: [00:40:53] Yes. We were—Dick went on it. It was the men. It was educators
from the US, and from Japan, and from other parts of Southeast Asia. There
were [Indonesians], and Koreans, and so forth. It was a very, very interesting
session. The wives who wanted to were allowed to sit in on the sessions,
which of course, for me was wonderful. [coughs] And Nate Pusey from
Harvard was represented by Ed Reischauer. Ed Reischauer had been
ambassador to Japan, and was married to a Japanese woman and [coughs]
taught us. We would spend the morning in these sessions. In the
afternoons, we would go out to see the treasures of Kyoto and Nara, because
they were right close together—with Ed as our guide [00:42:08]. I sent Paul
a postcard saying this exciting thing, that we had Ambassador Reischauer as
our guide to the treasures of Japan. When I got back, I could still see [us]—
standing on either side of this gargantuan kitchen counter in the ceremonial
kitchen, and his leaning across to me. He said [in this awed voice], “You
really had Ambassador Reischauer as your guide?” And I said, “Yes, we
really did.” He said, “He knows more about Japan than most Japanese!” My
whole status flipped right over.
Wise: Wow!
Lyman: [00:42:52] It was [laughs] so interesting. I just suddenly achieved a whole
new level because of the association.

111

Wise: But it doesn’t sound like it—before that, it doesn’t sound like the teaching
was an easy task. He was sort of telling you, and maybe, letting you make—
Lyman: [00:43:13] That’s right.
Wise: —a few mistakes, and then you sort of—
Lyman: [coughs]
Wise: —it sounds like it was rocky.
Lyman: [00:43:18] Yes.
Wise: It wasn’t like he sat down and said, “Let me help you.”
Lyman: [00:43:22] And I went through all of this business of the caterers, and so
forth to his hilarity. He thought this was very funny that I should even think
this was an important thing to do. Then he would detail all the things that
went home. And I would say, “All right, go and get ‘em back!”
Wise: [laughs] Did he live at the house?
Lyman: [00:43:43] No.
Wise: No.
Lyman: [00:43:44] He was a Buddhist priest in South Palo Alto.
Wise: Wow.
Lyman: [00:43:51] Our other person, who was the staff of our life, was Billie Bell.
Billie Bell was an African American woman from somewhere in the
Southeast, originally. This gorgeous woman. Big, statuesque creature, with
the most beautiful face you could imagine. And equanimity in the face of—
you can’t imagine the horrors that had gone on in her family! What
happened to her first husband, I don’t know. Her second husband was really
not her husband, but a live-in. He went berserk and tried to murder her.

112

Somebody murdered one of her children. [coughs] This was all going on in
East Palo Alto. And she didn’t know how to drive. Bill used to bring her
over, her husband, I mean, this man. After [00:45:00] he went berserk, and
finally died, fortunately, she had to learn to drive. To her last day, when she
drove, she had to drive only the way she knew. It didn’t matter whether it
was the most direct way, but it was the way she’d learned. That was all she
could do. Yet, she could handle 15 students to get food onto the table, to
get it off the table, to get the dishes done in the dishwasher, to clean up and
get the tables put away. She could do all of that. [coughs]
Wise: But she was there for more than just parties, though. Was she there every
day?
Lyman: [00:45:52] She and Paul were the two house staff. As I say, Anne had run
it—about five different people. And live-in people.
Wise: Was she doing cooking for you every night?
Lyman: [00:46:05] No.
Wise: No?
Lyman: [00:46:06] One of the stipulations that the kids made—the girls were off by
this time. The boys said, “We will not go and live with you in that place,” as
they said, “unless you be cook.” So when we were family, we were four peas
in a very large pod. There was that big dining room. There was a round
table up in the window, in the bay window there. We ate there.
Wise: And you’d cook.
Lyman: [00:46:46] Only we’d find very shortly [that we] had drawdown curtains
installed there because we were like sitting in a goldfish bowl.

113

Wise: Oh. Now I missed what they said, “We won’t move there unless you be the
cook?”
Lyman: [00:47:05] “We won’t go and live there.”
Wise: Okay. I just missed the word there. I just wanted to clarify.
Lyman: [00:47:10] Right. No. They said, “We won’t go and live with you in that
place.” That place.
Wise: Unless you were the cook.
Lyman: [00:47:16] Yes. The other thing they did—the first thing that they did was to
find that they could climb all the way up the outside of the house, on the
outside, without ever touching a stair.
Wise: [laughs]
Lyman: [00:47:30] And that thereby hung a tale, because Tim—we were in New
York—Tim had discovered he could go up the outside if he forgot his key,
and reach in through the cat window, and undo the door.
Wise: [laughs]
Lyman: [00:47:47] Undo the lock on the door just outside my bedroom, and go in
that door. Well, he was trying to climb up and we had a temporary young
man as our security guard, who saw this person going up and called him
down with a gun out—
Wise: Whoa!
Lyman: [00:48:06] —and was threatening to shoot him if he didn’t come down. Tim
came down. And he said, “Who are you?” Tim said, “Well, I’m the son.”
He said, “How do I know that?” Tim ended up having to get a faculty wife
to come and identify him and then to call us, in New York—and fortunately

114

got us, and said, “They will not let Tim into the house unless you confirm the
fact that he is your son.” Can you imagine that?
Wise: Well, not in light of what was going on, on the campus at that—
Lyman: [00:48:43] Well, I mean, yes. But this was way above and beyond. It was just
ludicrous. I mean, [Christiana Creighton] could’ve identified him right like
that. And then that would’ve been—
Wise: Right. Calling you was a bit over the top.
Lyman: [00:48:55] It was, definitely.
Wise: When you tell me they were throwing Coke bottles of paint through your
window, it was not a friendly environment—
Lyman: [00:49:01] Well then, of course, they threw bombs into the president’s office,
and Wally’s things got—this was when Dick was provost. All Wally’s things,
all his treasures, his academic treasures, were decimated. We still have a few
things that show the signs of the smoke damage, from Dick’s office, which
was way across the hall at Building 10. It was a very hairy time. That was
when we had Scotty Reston as the commencement speaker. He and Dick
had to come down through the back—this was still in Frost Amphitheater.
They had to come [00:49:52] down through the back of the stage because
they were afraid—our police were afraid to have them walk down and
through in the academic procession. That’s when Don [Lee] who had been
one of the freshman students, who we had such a great time with when Dick
was provost, entertaining at our house, you know, during Freshman Week.
This kid stood up in the middle of commencement and said, “I’m going to
shoot you,” and was taken out. I mean, it was not a nice time. I’d say that

115

for four years, we never went into a public meeting, even if it didn’t start out
that way, that didn’t end up as a confrontation of some kind.
Wise: Four years!
Lyman: [00:50:47] We never did. That’s when Dick used to say, “I don’t know why
I’m doing this.” And I said, “You [have] got to do it because [the kids sitting
around the edges of these confrontations by the same people every time]
need to hear your rational, coherent answers to everything.”
Wise: So you were providing that support?
Lyman: [00:51:07] Well, yes. I mean, it was—we needed each other. It was just
incredibly strong. And the kids were great. You know? They were amazing
because their allegiances were not with our-aged people. Yet they never—we
talked about anything and everything in front of them. They never let us
down. They never betrayed any of the things we talked about in the family.
They were absolutely extraordinary. This was after Jenny went off to
Berkeley, and then—in the first class of women that went into Yale, and
Holly went off to Hampshire, in the first class they ever had at Hampshire,
and then transferred eventually. When Jenny left Yale, Holly transferred in.
Then [laughs] Cricket, after having a year off— [after the Island and Gombe]
thing—went to Yale for four years. Cricket never did Yale in anything but a
maverick way. He wouldn’t conform to any of the sort of traditional things.
And Tim found he could go to Yale, got accepted at Yale, and then went to
Harvard. [laughs]

116

Wise: Was there any point at which you thought maybe Dick should resign? Or
should pull back? Were you worried? This is your husband. Were you
worried about his safety—?
Lyman: [00:52:46] Oh of course. We were both worried sick. There were times
when we—I can remember going, when the Chinese ping pong team came to
play here. Unfortunately, something happened so that we didn’t get—when
we arrived and we were driven up to Maples Pavilion where they were
playing, something went wrong with the police escort. So, we just stepped
out into this crowd. When people realized who we were, they suddenly
descended on us like this. Somebody—Victor Li, who was [a law professor],
extricated us and got us around to the back of Maples [00:53:40]. And we
went in the back door. But it—that was a hairy time. And crowds are so
weird.
Wise: Oh, yes. They take on a life of their own.
Lyman: [00:53:57] Yes. They really do.
Wise: But even then, you were still able to maintain your own work.
Lyman: [00:54:05] Yes, I did. I was working on, obviously for a while, on the Job
Opportunities in Continuing Education and then its [all] resulting in [both]
CROW and the Resource Center. But there was also a group led by—well,
CROW of course was a group of students, who were essentially—one
graduate student who—I know perfectly well what her name is—you can
figure it out.
Wise: Cynthia.

117

Lyman: [00:54:44] Cyn—no. Cynthia Davis and Beth Garfield were the two
undergraduate students.
Wise: Oh, they were undergrad.
Lyman: [00:54:51] And [Susan Hecht], who I see all the time because she’s on the
advisory panel to the Institute. But they were the three students who really
launched CROW. It started with a speech by Pat Graham from Radcliffe
and—no. Pat Graham from the School of Education at Harvard and
[Matina] Horner from Radcliffe, both talking about their own experiences as
women becoming established academics and then going from there. [Editor:
Matina Horner was the youngest president of Radcliff College (1972-1989)
and did early research into women’s fear of success.]
Wise: So were you still doing Fair Housing?
Lyman: [00:55:39] Yes.
Wise: You got into foundation work though, too.
Lyman: [00:55:49] No.
Wise: No?
Lyman: [00:55:49] Not yet. Before that, I got started with the Urban Coalition and
did the Fair Housing work and established the first Fair Housing section, the
only Fair Housing section of all the Urban Coalitions in the country. That
was under the aegis of John Gardner, who was then a trustee. That’s how we
got started on that. I just felt that it was essential to have something. I got
Henry Breitrose in the Department of Communication and Nate—
Wise: Maccoby?
Lyman: [00:56:42] Maccoby [Nathan Maccoby]. Thank you.

118

Wise: You’re welcome.
Lyman: [00:56:45] To do a series of 12 spots. Did you ever hear about those?
Wise: No.
Lyman: [00:56:50] Around Fair Housing?
Wise: No.
Lyman: [00:56:52] Oh, well, you ought to see if the Department of Communication
has any copies of this because this was a triumph. I got them $6,000 worth
of funding. It was almost all the money left over from the “No on 14” stuff.
They did these incredible spots using Stanford students. MCFH set up the
case histories for them. Then they took the students and faculty to be the
actors. Nate was one of the key actors in this. They did these marvelous
things. There were six spots for blacks, and six spots for—or five spots for
Native Americans. No. How did it work out—?
Wise: Asians?
Lyman: [00:58:04] Yes. There was one spot for Asians. Only one. But that was
because they were not seen to be discriminated against. It was the unseen
minority issue. Of course, they were dreadfully discriminated against. But
we had one—I think it was only one. It’s been so long since I’ve thought
about these. It’s hard to remember. But—I got Jack Black, who was then
Vice President at Pacific Telephone to get us H-O-U-S-I-N-G, housing, as a
telephone number. If you thought you were being discriminated against.
They had posters up in the buses, and they had announcements on public
service television. It was just astonishing what they did. The main office, of
course, was the Urban Coalition on campus, which was in the old Tower

119

House. But we had a group in Oakland, and we had a group in Marin as
well, to respond to specific cases that looked like real [01:00:03]
discrimination. It just went like a house afire. MCFH handled the cases
down here. Then we had a couple of graduate students in the business
school who did a set of surveys of the Peninsula. They made sandwich
teams—a white and a black, or a white and a Hispanic and a white and
sometimes they would reverse it. But mostly, that was configuration. They
would send these people out into neighborhoods where there’d been
anticipated or examples of discrimination. They would simply record what
they did. No [01:00:57] questions asked, they would try to rent a place.
Then when they get back, the interesting thing was that often the minority
was not even aware of being discriminated against. When they got back and
compared the notes from each of these, they discovered these blatant—I
mean, really blatant, discriminatory practices. So we began bringing cases.
That just turned everything upside down. It was just amazing what a
difference it made.
Wise: Well, you’re documenting it at that point.
Lyman: [01:01:39] Absolutely. Very systematically, but very low-key, and
unobtrusive. So it really, really worked. So that was all going on at MCFH.
But it was using the spots also. I mean, thus everything—all of this stuff was
going on. It was all under the auspices of the Fair Housing Chapter of the
Urban Coalition. And just all sorts of ramifications of these things. That
was all going on. I can’t remember the exact sequence of everything, but—
Wise: Right. No. Of course not, that’s fine. I just wanted to get a flavor of that.

Wise: All right. I think we’re set to go. Last time we covered a lot of the housing,
and also CROW and the Resource Center. So I wanted to ask a summary
question, which is, what advice would you give to today’s housing activists?
Approaching some of the same issues that you did?
Lyman: [00:00:41] Ah. Well, I’m still very much involved with it. That’s essentially
what Enterprise does—is work on affordable housing. What they have done,
and I think it’s very exciting, is to bring together the Green Movement with
affordable housing so that they have a new goal to make all affordable
housing green by, I think, 2020, which would be a big thing. But that’s what
they're building. And when they say it’s “green,” it has a huge impact on the
health of the people living in those buildings. It’s also turning out to be—
although their basis of making the decision in the first place was that it would
only increase their costs by two percent [00:02:10]. In fact, the cost of
operations so reduces the expenses of the residents, that it becomes costeffective almost before it begins and then a real money saver for low-income
people. So, it’s a win-win-win. It’s a hugely important movement and we’ve
really led the way on that, which I think is very exciting. It’s part of the
movement to go green, but we were seven years ahead of the crest, which is,
I think, fascinating.
Wise: Are you discouraged that you're still dealing with these same issues?

122

Lyman: [00:03:02] Oh my God. I mean, they’ll go on forever and in the context of
the world, and in this country especially, the discrepancy. No, not just in this
country—anywhere. The discrepancy between low-income people and highincome people is so enormous at this point and the numbers are so
disproportionate. There’s this little nugget of people at the top and then this
huge amorphous mass at the bottom and decreasing numbers of middle class
people of course. That’s one of the points that politics makes these days. I
think it’s a very serious situation. But I [00:03:53] think one of the ways to
deal with it effectively is in the context of creating livable environments for
people that then other people want to imitate [laughs]. This is going to make
a difference. Plus, it’s going to make an economic difference for the families
who are living in these homes and it’s both rental and home ownership.
We’ve been working, of course, very closely on this. We’ve done a huge
amount of work on this problem of home mortgages. In the first place, our
constituents, for the most part—I think something like only two percent of
[00:04:47] our families fell into that trap. But we’re working very closely with
the communities where it was just an explosion to try and—especially in the
New Orleans Gulf Coast area, but in any of our concentration places around
the country. [Editor: Lyman is referring to the mortgage and credit crisis of
the 2000s in which many families cannot pay their mortgages and are facing
housing foreclosure.]
Wise: But would you say that the [low-income housing] movement has matured
since you started it up?

123

Lyman: [00:05:15] Oh, yes. I mean, hugely. And the green aspect of it is an evidence
of the maturity. But it’s so different, so very different now. We don’t
have—but the university has been working on these issues for years—as far
as Palo Alto is concerned, we don’t have such a thing as low-income housing.
But there’s a project now that’s got city approval. It’s right down on Alma
Street, just below where Whole Foods is—to do a 50-unit affordable
[00:06:09] housing, mixed income and mixed size. Everything from singles
to three bedrooms, in the 50-units, so that there’s a diversity of income and
size, that’s important. It’s to deal with some of the low-income workers at
Stanford among other things. Think of all the kitchen people, the grounds
people, and so forth. They're all caught in this.
Wise: And they travel from very long distances.
Lyman: [00:06:45] Oh, hugely long distance. It’s a disaster. And I do think that one
of the things that’s happened here is smart growth, the whole movement to
look at connecting to transportation and schools and so forth, so that you
have a complex of livability. And that’s another thing that we’ve pioneered
on.
Wise: When you say “we,” you mean Enterprise?
Lyman: [00:07:15] Enterprise. And we’re not the only ones. LISC [Local Initiatives
Support Corporation] is still doing it. A lot of other people are doing this
kind of thing now. But we have been a pioneer in this, there’s no question
about that.
Wise: Now, the other thing we talked a lot about was women.

124

Lyman: [00:07:37] [laughs] And that we go right on with. You know, that changes,
but it doesn’t change.
Wise: Right. I know, I wanted to ask the same thing.
Lyman: [00:07:47] I’m sure you're well aware of that. [laughs]
Wise: Well, I wanted to ask the same question about that topic—I don’t know.
Lyman: [00:07:55] Where are we now compared to where we were?
Wise: That and also, what advice would you give to a woman returning to the
workforce, and what are the challenges she faces?
Lyman: [00:08:04] Oh. Well for one thing, women go in and out of the workforce
somewhat more readily. You still read a lot of stories about the woman who
drops out to have a family and loses her priority position in advancement.
But even that I think is changing. And I’ve been part of various initiatives.
There was a big initiative here started by a fascinating young woman down at
San Jose who put together a study. In fact, it really was the progenitor, if you
will, [laughs] of what is now The Women of Silicon Valley Donor Circle for
the Women’s Foundation. But it was two years of research [00:09:02] on
what women’s lives were like in the Mid-Peninsula. There were two reports
that were done. I don’t know how you’d get them. They're somewhere in
the offing, but [laughs]—and several of the Stanford people were involved
with this. Juanita [M. Kreps], who’s been a vice president, was one of the big
corporate people who came back to the university as a vice president,
interestingly. But looking particularly at the fact that what women really want
to do, and increasingly younger men, is to find a balance. So that they’re not
working 87 hours a week [laughs] and sort of sleeping when they can, and

125

[00:10:15] eating when they can, and so on, and unable to relate to families
because they're never there. Or if they are, they're just—everything is sort of,
“rush to do this, and rush to do that.” I think people are trying to come to
grips with that a little bit more than they were. Certainly, for low-income
women particularly, it’s a huge issue, because to make ends meet, they often
have to hold one and two and three jobs.
Wise: Especially in this area.
Lyman: [00:11:02] Yes. I mean, the cost of living here is out of sight. Even in the
housing field, the allowance has to be so much bigger here to qualify
someone for affordable housing. It’s outta sight! It’s ludicrous to be like
that.
Wise: So, I just wanted to sort of do a cap on that.
Lyman: [00:11:35] Oh by the way, I’m going to go off the board of Enterprise. Our
December meeting is a teleconference. I’m thrilled to know that that’s the
last one of those we’re going to do. They find they're just not adequate. It’s
a three-hour session with people from all over the country and sometimes—
in the first place, the attendance is way down [on teleconference meetings]
because people just don’t—they’ve got to either commit to something or
they don’t and then they’re caught between. But I’m going to stay through
that and then I’m going off the board. It’s too hard for me to handle
everything anymore and they need to have a space to get new people and
new blood. I said, “And I hope you get a woman, and I hope you get a
woman of color!” [laughs]

126

Wise: [laughs] Good for you! All right. Okay, back to—again, some of this will be
a little summary to recap some of the things we’ve talked about and others
will go into new places.
Lyman: [00:12:59] Has it made any kind of sense at all?
Wise: Yes. It’s coming together nicely.
Lyman: [00:13:03] Oh good, that’s great.
Wise: During the activist years, which we’ve discussed, the 70’s, particularly
difficult years from your perspective, what—?
Lyman: [00:13:20] Oh you mean the student activist years?
Wise: Student activist years.
Lyman: [00:13:23] Yes. Not my activist years.
Wise: [laughs] That’s right.
Lyman: [00:13:26] My activist years went on until quite recently, I think.
Wise: [laughs] I was going to say, they haven’t stopped!
Lyman: [00:13:30] [laughs] No, they have, but only recently.
Wise: [00:13:35] The student activists during the 70’s.
Lyman: [00:13:37] Yes. The late 60’s, early 70’s. Yes.
Wise: Right. From your perspective, what were the main challenges confronting the
university administration? Not necessarily you personally or your family
personally, but overall? If you can step back a little?
Lyman: [00:13:59] Well, the assumption by students and some faculty that the
administration was all captive of the Military Industrial Complex. The
stereotyping of individuals was so ludicrous. It just was outrageous. I think
that, in turn, led to a lot of the other things that happened. I think it was

127

Bliss Carnochan gave a report to the [Stanford Historical Society] about
those years. And several people who had really been out for Dick’s throat
during the time, I mean, had been really outrageous, and particularly
[00:15:01] in the [laughs] English Department, stood up and said, “You
know, he really did an extraordinary job and although we didn’t agree with
what he was trying to do or what he was always doing, we appreciated his
total honesty in the way he went about it, and that you always knew where
you stood with him.” That there was no sort of trying to pull the wool over
people’s eyes. He was very upfront about what he was doing, and why. Of
course, what he was doing was holding onto the parts of the University that
were so absolutely essential while he was also helping those who wanted
[00:16:01] to make the change to make the changes that made sense, in terms
of adapting to a very different environment. I think he was absolutely
brilliant in that. And my role in respect to that was simply to serve as the gobetween from time to time when it was necessary. But mainly to serve as
moral support. And that’s what our kids did, too, which I think was so
extraordinary. They disagreed with him often and we had colossal fights, as I
think I’ve said, [laughs] in the bosom of the family. But they stood behind
him wholly to the external world. It was just absolutely extraordinary and
incredibly rewarding in the long run [00:17:04] because it really established
the kind of relationships that we’ve had with them ever since. In spite of
having had moments of controversy and so forth as we went along, as they
went along, we’ve come back each time to the center of equilibrium in that
understanding of the different ways people approach things.

128

Wise: Can you give an example, for instance, of what a member of the English
department would’ve wanted Dick to do that he wasn’t doing?
Lyman: [00:17:43] Well of course, there was the whole Bruce Franklin snafu [laughs].
I think people were confused as to whether they should have these classes
that were extra-mural, so to speak [laughs]. What he [Dick] was trying to do
was to hold onto a structure that would allow students to continue to learn
and mainly not to interfere with their ability to get diverse perspectives on
something, which was so important. Of course, he was dealing with
[00:18:29] the trustees who were going up the wall. If you look at his book,
and it probably would be a good idea to look [at it]. Have you read his book?
Wise: Yes parts of it.
Lyman: [00:18:43] But look back at it for the period of the time when he was dealing
with a changing understanding of the Board of Trustees and how they had to
move the trustee meetings off of campus, because there just was no way they
were going to have an undisrupted meeting on campus. As I said, I think it
was four years that we never went into a public meeting of any kind that
didn’t turn into a confrontation, even if it didn’t start out that way, and it was
so often the same little group of people asking the same questions. It was
really for the benefit of the kids [00:19:32] around the outside that it was—
and everybody else around the outside. [Editor: Lyman is referring to the fact
that she and Dick Lyman continued to visit dorms and meet with students.
She spoke more extensively about this in the previous interview sessions of
this oral history.] Of course, one of the things about a university president is
that he has so damn many constituencies. For a while, the alumni were

129

absolutely tied in a ball. Not all of them, but enough of them were just
really turned off and they were also different alumni. [laughs] That made a
difference too, so that they really didn’t understand it—their university. This
was a major [00:20:17] factor in our deciding to go and live at Hoover House,
which we didn’t want to do, but we felt that that was one of the symbols for
the generations of Stanford alums that represented a kind of lynchpin, a
stability. And although I did [laughs] outrageous things with it, and I had this
rotating art exhibit where I hung things that were pretty far out—
Wise: I want to talk about that, but I wanted to stay on this right now.
Lyman: [00:20:55] But, by using Hoover House, and entertaining there, and having
people come to the house, and having students working at the parties, so that
people saw students behaving in a normal way, was hugely important in that
whole thing. I had pretty strict parameters about what I could do and what I
couldn’t do, but I also knew that I could always go to Dick and say, “Should
I do this, or who should I talk to about it?” And I often talked to Bob
Rosenzweig about whether I should—in terms of the kind of entertainment
that I should be doing at Hoover House, and whether the University should
be picking up the tab for that. One of the things that happened, and this was
the point at which [laughs] Jerry Brown was first [00:22:01] governor.
[Editor: Lyman is referring to Governor Jerry Brown’s first two terms of
governorship from 1975 to 1983]. He made an exploration of the expenses
of the [University of California] presidential houses, the chancellor’s
residences, and the costs, and so forth. This was at a budget adjustment—
you know, we went through two major budget adjustment programs during

130

Dick’s presidency. So this was always an issue. They came to me and asked
me if I could by any chance tell them what the cost of our operation was. I
said, “Well I can’t tell you about the grounds care, because I don’t have
anything to do with—that’s all done outside of me. But I can tell you about
[00:22:52] what it costs, how many people we entertain. I can tell you exactly
-- give me time to go to my records -- exactly how many people we have
entertained in the course of the year, what kinds of things we’ve served, and
what our costs have been.” They were blown away because our costs were
so low. Well, you haven’t lived with my husband all your life [laughs] not to
be aware of how to spend your pennies. We did really [00:23:31] oblige by
reducing costs. But it was a stripped-down operation. There were a lot of
people who criticized us because it seemed to be sort of on a shoestring. But
I think, in the end, people really basically appreciated it, and understood it.
Wise: I think of you as starting out as an educator but maybe not. But, I framed
this—
Lyman: [00:24:25] Well, I was an educator, but I backed into it.
Wise: You backed into it. My question is on the assumption that you were at some
point. As an educator, how did you feel about the process of education
being so drastically interrupted during those years, both at Stanford and
across the country? One place I’m coming from is that I did an interview
with Professor Larry Ryan who said that the graduate students had to meet in
some of the professors’ homes because they couldn’t continue classes.

131

Lyman: [00:25:00] Oh, yes. Of course, we chose to have Dick’s seminars in our
home. But that was while he was teaching still. So that was not, for us, an
unusual thing.
Wise: Right. But just overall, was this a heartbreaking experience for you to see
education interrupted like this? Or were you angry about it?
Lyman: [00:25:29] Yes. We were sometimes angry, but I think we were also
understanding that it also developed some very important flexibility. Take,
for example, coming along at that point was the whole question of coed
dorms, which actually came out of the Stanford Abroad experience of these
kids who had a much more cosmopolitan approach in these campuses.
When they got back, they didn’t want to be regimented into the kind of
traditional men’s [00:26:22] dormitories and women’s dormitories. So that
was one of the factors. The whole question of the development of Human
Biology began this business of cross-disciplinary teaching. Actually this was a
hugely plus factor in this whole thing. So while there were awful things
happening, there were also wonderful things happening. You just had to try
and help one and not the other. I think that would be my [thoughtful
pause]—it was terribly disruptive. It was less disruptive on our campus in a
strange way. Although we had more disruptions, it was less universally
disruptive on our campus, it seems to me, than it was for instance on the
Columbia campus, or some of [00:27:36] the others. And some of them
didn’t get anything at all. There was a wonderfully crude but entertaining
experience that we had when we went to Joel Smith’s inauguration at
Kenyon College. I was sitting in the front row with Dick’s cousin who was

132

from the area, and Bill Wyman, who was then an assistant dean [at Stanford].
[laughs] And here was this corn-fed choral group up here, and Bill kept
looking at these kids, boys and girls just looking so traditional, and so totally
in contrast to our students. And Bill sort [00:28:35] of turned to me and he
said, “You know, I bet we don’t hear ‘fuck you’ once today!” [laughs] I
thought I was going to expire right there [laughs], because I’m sure he had
heard it many times. [laughs]
Wise: That’s hilarious. Well that puts it in perspective. [laughs]
Lyman: [00:29:00] Yes, it does put it in perspective. That’s what you had to do, and I
think one of the things that Dick managed to do for the campus as a whole
and certainly for these different constituencies—I mean, you had the
students, you had the faculty, you had the staff, you had the alumni, you had
the public at large, you had the Board of Trustees, all of them with their own
agendas. Somehow you had to find a ground that made sense, and move
stuff forward. That’s where I think his huge strengths were, in [00:29:40]
doing that. And the other thing which I’ve always had huge admiration for
him—having the ability to work with his surrounding staff people, and some
of them very diverse people and often not easy people. But helping them to
use their own strengths maximally, and then giving them a lot of leeway to
do that and also giving them leeway to move out when they didn’t want to
stay around anymore. All of that, I think, led to an [00:30:23] atmosphere
that led back to this comment at the Historical Association meeting, that you
always knew where you stood and you could get a straight and honest
answer. And I think that was absolutely brilliantly done on his part.

133

Wise: Now, let’s just take an even broader view of the administration. What would
you say are some of the major accomplishments during his presidency?
Lyman: [00:31:00] During his ten years?
Wise: Yes.
Lyman: [00:31:03] Well, obviously, to bring the university back to equilibrium. And
to solve the problems, financial problems, again with fabulous staff, for
dealing with the budget adjustment programs that allowed us to do that.
Then having the courage to go—and it was—I’m blocking on the trustee. I
can see him. Dick would probably remember his name, but—who pushed
the Board of Trustees to go for the 300 million dollar endowment program.
[Lyman: the trustee was Roger Lewis] That was outta sight, at that point.
And not [00:31:51] only to agree to do it, but to do it, and do it successfully.
So there were a whole lot of things. It was as though you had an hourglass
that was doing this, and in the course of the ten years, it [laughs] did this.
(Lyman makes a motion of tipping an hourglass upside down.) It was such a
totally transformed situation. In fact, when we took that Danforth leave in
the fall, you know, Dick got a special grant from the Danforth Foundation in
the fall of ’72 to just—he could do anything he wanted as long as he didn’t
do anything about Stanford and its education. And he could go anywhere he
wanted. We went up to [family-owned Barred Islands] and spent a couple of
weeks on our own up [00:33:02] there first. Then [laughs] I was to present—
thanks to Roger Hines—at a conference of university people on women’s
issues [laughs], [the American Council on Education] meeting in Miami. The
morning that we left the island, we got up and I had to crack the ice on the

134

water [laughs] bucket. It was so cold overnight. Then we got packed up and
left the island, and Cricket drove us up to Bangor and we flew straight to
Miami, a nonstop flight from Bangor to Miami, [laughs] and got in, and the
temperature was 82 in Miami. [laughs] And the air conditioning wasn’t
working in our hotel room. [00:34:05] I can remember, it was The
Fontainebleau. Oh God! It was just awful! But then we went straight to
England. We got this wonderful little house in Chelsea on a tiny little street
right behind St. Luke’s Church, off of Sydney Road. It was just the perfect
environment. In the first place, I wasn’t at all sure—and I may have said this
before but—I wasn’t at all sure what was going to happen to the two of us
when we sat down opposite each other without living at the height of
revolutionary [00:34:48] circumstance. I mean, would we have anything
“there there?” What we found was that we had a [laughs] whole lot “there
there.” Dick was reading a lot on higher education. He spent a lot of time
reading. I went off and looked at art galleries all over the city. We went and
did things, we went to concerts—a whole slew of concerts, all over the city.
It was absolutely wonderful. We could go whenever we wanted to, we could
stay whenever we wanted to, we both read. I just read fascinating, fun things
when I wasn’t out charging around somewhere. Then [laughs] this little
house, the garden had been totally neglected and I just took off all my
[00:35:46] energies on going out and digging up the garden, and putting in
little pots of flowers, the way my mother had done with a Philadelphia
garden, to make it look like something. [laughs] And there was just fun.
Fortunately, the owners lived in the house next door and we enjoyed them

135

enormously. It all worked out. And we came back, then—I think again I
mentioned this, that just before we were due to come back, we got the news
about Herb Packer committing suicide, which [00:36:31] was absolutely
devastating. Unfortunately, that same day, we went out to Cliveden, [Editor:
Stanford’s overseas studies campus in England at the time] and the kids who
were still at Cliveden were kids who’d left at the height of all the troubles in
the spring of ’72. They were still full of fight and it was just one long,
constant confrontation. We came home that night and Dick just said, “I
don’t know why I’m going back to this.” But what happened was that we
got back and there was no “there there.” It was so unlike what we just
experienced at Cliveden.
Wise: When did you go back?
Lyman: [00:37:20] We went back almost immediately.
Wise: Like, six months? Were you over there six—?
Lyman: [00:37:29] No, it was three months. So it would’ve been [at the end of Fall
quarter]. And there was complete quiet. There was nothing there. We just
couldn’t adjust that fast. It took us a long time to stop having to gear up to
go into a student [gathering]. It seemed to me for years I had knots in my
stomach. Every time we went into—
Wise: A room.
Lyman: [00:38:13] —where there were students. All of a sudden one night I think we
both looked at each other and said, “Hey: students are fun aren’t they?” And
then there was no more problem. I don’t know exactly how long it took, but
it took literally months and months to get there.

136

Wise: Well, you had never been—he had never been president when it was calm.
Lyman: [00:38:39] Oh, no. That’s true. (talking at same time) And even provost. I
mean, when he had been provost, it had been a mess. So it’s true. We didn’t
have any basis of understanding what it could be like, except for having
watched Wally. And Wally, of course, fell apart at the seams at the end, poor
darling. He certainly couldn’t have coped. And Ken Pitzer couldn’t cope,
obviously. [laughs]
Wise: Nope. [laughs] He was not the right man for the job. When did Dick
become president?
Lyman: [00:39:24] He became provost in ’67, and president in September of ’70.
Wise: Then by ’73, you're saying—
Lyman: [00:39:35] It was a different ballgame.
Wise: Right. And so let’s say from ’73 to ’77, right, was—?
Lyman: [00:39:43] Well, no, he went on until ’80.
Wise: Till ’80. Then what were the things that he was focusing on, or what would
you say some of those accomplishments were in those years? Was that still
part of the budget crunch?
Lyman: [00:39:58] Well, we had a second budget crunch but it was without the
student disruption aspect of it. And the trustees had learned a fair amount
also and had also changed, because they’d changed the whole trustee method
with the election of alumni [to the Board of Trustees], and so forth. It just—
Wise: Opened it up.
Lyman: [00:40:29] It opened it up. Everything was opened up. So it really was so
different in that respect.

137

Wise: But now, were there curriculum issues that he was working on, or what other
types of things were there—?
Lyman: [00:40:42] Now, that’s his problem. I didn’t get into that.
Wise: Okay. But from your perspective, I’m wondering—when you look at the
administration during his time, what you see as some of the
accomplishments, during the second half, I would say.
Lyman: [00:41:01] Well, obviously, the inclusion of women at all levels was a hugely
important thing and not easy, because that’s one of the things that we were
working on. It started, really, in the early ‘70s, when we did that session,
Helen Bryson, and Jane Fairbank, and Sue Bell did for the—became the
precursor of the Resource Center for Women but also, in a way, led to some
of the work that CROW began to do. And I was so involved with both of
those, and actually chaired the board. When Dick became president, I was
already president of Mid-Peninsula Citizens for Fair Housing. We had been
trying to move affordable housing for staff on campus and we [00:42:21]
both decided that I was not the right person to be doing that at that time,
that it was just too controversial. So I stepped down as president of MCFH,
but I stayed on the board until we left in 1980 and was very much involved
with the transition of that organization from fair and affordable housing
into—with the help of Stanford students—into testing—a process of testing
discrimination in housing.
Wise:

We covered that, yes.

138

Lyman: [00:43:03] Yes. That was just hugely important and really made a significant
impact on the community in that context. Again, everything was changing.
and we were just part of all of that.
Wise: Were you excited by the change?
Lyman: [00:43:26] Well, yes, and especially as I began to watch the change for
women. And it was frustrating. You felt as though you were going two steps
forward and one back, but it was moving. Dick was a very important factor
in that. This is one of the things—when Myra Strober [Editor: Stanford
professor of education and (by courtesy) professor of economics at the
Graduate School of Business] first came to me and asked for help, and I said,
“Well you surely should go to Dick because he’s a better feminist than I am.”
That was a really, eye-opener for her. And one thing—they kept putting
their [00:44:11] feet in their mouths. But really, they would try to do
fundraising things that they shouldn’t have been doing and I kept saying,
“Look: if you want my help, you’ve got to go through the right channels
because I can’t help you if you're going to go off on a tangent like that and
try to do something on your own.” That the Development Office—Oh, that
was another thing. God, I was so irate that the Development Office only
had women listed in their husbands’ names. I [00:44:51] mean, can you
believe that? This was like Paul Nakajo being called “house boy,” for God’s
sake, when he was the House Manager. And I fought and bled because every
time I wanted to get women’s names on the nametags for people who we
were entertaining at Hoover House, they wouldn’t have any names for the
women. They were just “Mrs. George.” So, I said, “Look: if you don’t do

139

anything else, you’ve got to change this. You’ve got to get your records so
that women have names in their own rights because they are women. They
may be also ‘Mrs. George,’ but they’re [00:45:43] ‘Susan,’ too. And you’ve
got to do that.” I think that did change fairly significantly. Not enough and it
took even longer to get it through. I’m not sure that it’s all completely
through now. But it’s certainly different.
Wise: It’s certainly frustrating in an alumni situation where you only would’ve
known them—
Lyman: [00:46:08] Well exactly.
Wise: —by their first name and their maiden name, but at least to know their first
names.
Lyman: [00:46:17] Can you believe it?
Wise: No. [laughs]
Lyman: [00:46:19] I can’t remember the exact year. I can remember sitting down
with the Development Office, Peter Sylvester, who was in the Development
Office. I said, “Peter, this is totally unacceptable. You have got to find out.
I will not entertain these people as Mr. and Mrs. George. They have to be
Susan and George.” And so in the course of the ten years, it did change.
But boy, was it hard. Whoo!
Wise: Harder than you would expect.
Lyman: [00:47:00] Well, no. Not in retrospect. I mean, not considering what it was
like then. It was not surprising at all. Although I have to admit, I was
dumbfounded to find out that they didn’t even have records of these

140

peoples’ names, and, of course, especially if they weren’t Stanford alums. If
they were Stanford alums, they might have a name for them.
Wise: All right. We are on the topic of entertaining. So, I wanted to ask about a
couple of things. Are there some special memories of particular guests or
experiences you had while you were entertaining at Hoover House?
Lyman: [00:47:49] [laughs] Well, I’m having such a problem with names these days.
Eban—oh, God. That’s not the—the Israeli Prime Minister. Or was he the
Foreign Minister? I think he was the Foreign Minister, who was very exciting
to me. A very special person. I can’t remember his name. But he was
absolutely first-rate. That was one. [Editor: Abba Eban was Foreign Affairs
Minister for Israel, 1966-1974]
Wise: What was he doing visiting Stanford?
Lyman: [00:48:36] Beats me at this point.
Wise: Just coming through? [laughs]
Lyman: [00:48:38] No he was probably giving a lecture.
Wise: That makes sense.
Lyman: [00:48:42] A lot of the people we entertained were people who were giving
lectures. And we had the University colleges. You know, when they set up
the University seminars as fundraising events, we would have a dinner.
Everybody got there Friday evening and they would have a session Saturday
morning and then they would go to the game Saturday afternoon. Then they
would usually have something personal on Sunday, and that was it. But these
were clusters of people—about, oh, 20, 25 people. Couples. And we would
have a dinner [00:49:29] for them. One of the things we discovered was that

141

I would sit with the guest of honor, male, on my right and Dick would sit
with his spouse on his right. He would come afterwards and say, “I couldn’t
get a word out of this woman.” We discovered that I would have these
fascinating conversations at my table and often involving the whole table. I
can remember a discussion of our children’s living arrangements as they went
to campus, any campus. And I said, “Well, you know, one of our daughters
has been living with a friend [00:50:26] for several years now and we assume
that maybe they’ll get married but maybe they won’t,” where at one point
around the table everybody said, “Oh we’ve got one of those!” Suddenly it
opened the door for people to begin to talk about these different
relationships that their children were developing, which was interesting. But,
there was this discrepancy between my experience with the males and Dick’s
experience with their spouses. Of course, he was seen to be such an
intimidating person that it was probably harder for them anyway. But it was
just painful because he would not have—and I used to try and set up a table
that would [00:51:19] give some leaven to his table, so that it wouldn’t be all
dependent on this interaction between this woman and him. That’s one of
the things that changed. But it was very interesting. It did change to some
degree over the years. [laughs] We had all sorts of funny experiences. I
remember we gave—when we were giving a dinner just around the big table
in the dining room which seated 14 people, and this was for an endowed
professorship in Religion. And I won’t go into which religion, or what. But
the guests of honor, the endower of the professorship was there and a
[00:52:20] leading member of the religious clergy was coming. At first, he

142

was coming with his wife, and then he called up and said no, his wife was not
coming. Then he appeared, late at around a 14-person table with the spouse.
And Marjorie Manning—did you ever know Marjorie Manning?
Wise: No.
Lyman: [00:52:54] Marjorie was the divorced wife of the Dean of the Law School,
Bayless Manning. But she was the most absolutely ravishing creature you
ever saw in your life, statuesque. And she still is, in her high 80’s, blonde,
sylph-like creature. [laughs] She went to the door and I came down from
the dining room towards the door as she rounded the corner. She and I just
looked at each other. And I spoke to them and greeted them effusively and
she walked up to the table, took her card off the table, and showed [laughs]
this wife to the spot at the table. He was perfectly well aware of what he’d
done. But there was not a ripple. It just flowed. But that kind of situation
we were constantly getting into. It was just one thing after another [laughs].
Wise: And maybe not always rescued as gracefully. [laughs]
Lyman: [00:54:05] No, not always rescued gracefully. I’m trying to think of
situations. Well, there was, of course, the classic case when, oh God, Dick
wasn’t there and Joel Smith was serving as my host. I was upstairs getting
dressed and a whole busload, from one foundation, of people were to come.
Fifty people were to get out at once from this bus. Fifteen minutes before
they were due to arrive, all the electricity went off on the main floor. And
[laughs] I yelled over the banister to Jeff O’Connor, my house manager at
that point [00:54:55], and said, “Get those candle butts, Jeff!” We’d been
saving all the little candle butts from Christmas for Halloween pumpkins.

143

[laughs] When I came downstairs dressed, just as the bus was coming, there
were these little saucers all over the living room and the dining room with
these little candles in them. And it looked so festive, you can’t believe it.
Everybody said, “Oh, how charming! How absolutely beautiful!”
Fortunately, at exactly the moment at which Jeff was coming up to me to say
dinner is served, the lights miraculously went on. [00:55:38] I was terrified
that as people started to go up the stairs into the dining room that
somebody’s clothes would get set on fire with one of these candles. So we
[laughs] extinguished all the candles quickly and everything went off fine.
But that was one of the kinds of crises that [laughs] one had to deal with.
Then there was the night when we were entertaining the visiting committee
to the School of Engineering and the master dishwasher in the kitchen went
on the fritz. [laughs] Billie Bell, my beloved housekeeper, came and said,
“The dishwasher won’t work.” I said, well, we’ve obviously got all these
engineers.” And I made it a public [00:56:28] announcement: “Can anybody
[laughs] go out and fix our dishwasher? We’ve got a crisis.” Not a [laughs]
single person. Nobody was willing to try and even take it on. So, we
muddled through. The kids [student workers] spent hours and hours and
hours washing dishes that night, but they did it. They were so wonderful.
Again, Ken Kaufman fed me these students, especially in the early days. It
was so important to have reliable kids. And I had a funny experience with
Paul Nakajo, who absolutely [00:57:09] refused to let women be bartenders.
I said, “Paul, you can’t do this. It’s unacceptable.” Actually it was the
daughter of one of my staff people at the Urban Coalition who had been

144

working parties, this gorgeous girl. She came to me and she said, “You know
that Paul won’t let us do this?” And I said, “Well, Melinda, that’s not fair.”
She said, “No. But you’ve got to speak to him.” So I said, “Paul, you have
got to let [00:57:45] the women do this too.” It just was so hard for him. I
recently heard stories about some of the things that he did that I don’t even
want to think about in retrospect from my son—who also worked parties. I
worked on the premise that our kids [the Lyman kids] were somewhat
limited as to what they could do because of their relation to us. So I had no
compunction about employing them and paying them what I was paying the
students. So both the boys worked parties. And Cricket then also, I don’t
think Tim did. But Tim started up something called The PsycheDeli, which
was the first of the cafeterias in any of the departments, if you can believe
this. And he [00:58:42] started it up while he was—I think it was while he
was still earning money to go to Yugoslavia. But Cricket would work for
Carol [Peer?], our caterer, at parties off campus and he had descriptions of
being driven back by faculty or staff who were in no condition to drive and
being absolutely terrified and being very concerned. Interestingly, he doesn’t
drink at all anymore. But he was very concerned about the level of drinking.
It was probably an education for him because he certainly saw the results of
people who got too much.
Wise: I think people were much more casual about drinking and driving then.
Lyman: [00:59:43] Absolutely. But we were very, very circumspect about what we
served because that was when it was first being challenged legally. I mean,
we served everything, but we really held things down to a dull roar. I had

145

everybody programmed to just not push anybody. I hate people who push
alcohol. And [laughs] I had a system. I was drinking gin and tonics in those
days and I would start with a reasonable gin and tonic. The next time, I
would have half the amount of gin, and the third time—because I would just
be drinking with other people—the third time I would [01:00:32] [laughs] just
have straight tonic so that it wasn’t clear. But I just felt it was terribly
important not to lose control of myself.
Wise: Absolutely. Absolutely.

[End of Jing Lyman Interview Part IV]

146

Interview Session Five
December 5, 2010

(misc.)
Wise: And this is December 5, 2010.
(misc.)
Wise: Do you want me to ask questions, or did you want to start out with
something?
Lyman: [00:00:15] Well, let me just make sure you have it, because when we first got
to Stanford, remember, we drove across the country with four little kids.
Wise: I don’t think we heard about that.
Lyman: [00:00:25] All right. Tim was then not yet two. Or, no, he was just two.
Was he just two? No, he was less than two. He had to be because he was
born in ’57. And he apparently developed—we didn’t know what he
developed, but it was apparently an ear infection that went on for a number
of months. But we arrived having had the most ghastly night in Fernley,
Nevada—Nevada—before coming across the mountains. It was so funny
because everybody was sick to death of traveling at that point.
[00:01:07] We were six of us in a Plymouth station wagon with this Kiddie
Corral crib, with the kind of screened crib that Tim was in taking up a large
part of it, the two little girls sitting on the forward back seat, and Cricket sort
of roaming around in the space on the side of the crib, and Tim in the crib.
And Tim was sick. He was obviously in pain and he’d been up most of the
night crying.
Wise: So he was sick.
147

Lyman: [00:02:45] He was sick. And the kids had had it up to here. We’d been
traveling for God knows how many days. My brother told me that it never
rained in the West in the summertime, so we had no tent. And it rained. And
we had to pile everybody into the car in the middle of the night and go on.
We got to the Badlands, and very appropriately named, but they were bliss
because we all looked at the Badlands. [We foreshortened our trip.] By the
time we got to Nevada, they were up the wall. I mean, all the games had
given out. All the paper dolls were boring and so on. So it was a rough
arrival [in Palo Alto].
[00:03:41] I called Louise Wright. Gordon Wright was then about to be head
of the History Department and I called Louise and said, “Can you set us up
with a doctor’s appointment, and we’ll go straight to wherever it is we go.”
We went to that little house that [was the clinic]—used to be a little gray
house down opposite the health club on El Camino. You know that little
place? Just on the edge of Southgate. That’s where Dr. Cutter, who was one
of the staples of the pediatric staff of the clinic, was. No, it was Gurdon
Pulford at that point.
Wise: Who?
Lyman: [00:04:28] Gurdon Pulford—P-U-L-F-O-R-D, who became our pediatrician.
And Tim saw him at that point.
Wise: What was his first name?
Lyman: [00:04:41] Gurdon. G-U-R-D-O-N. He became our pediatrician and it was
just coincidental that we saw him because this was the end of an afternoon,
and so on. But for some reason or other he was not on duty. When I called

148

in, Tim was in dire straits. After that, he saw us and gave us some stuff for
Tim. Then we went to a little house that Otis Pease’s [family] had moved out
of in Southgate, and we moved in on their lease and simply assumed their
lease while they moved into a house on Salvatierra Street, which they had
bought.
[00:05:31] Just to finish on Tim and Dr. [Pulford], I called up the clinic and
said this child is [sick], you know, I really think you ought to see him. And
he was so curmudgeonly, I couldn’t stand it. I got in there and I was just
terrified. And he looked at Tim and he said, “My God, this kid is really sick.”
And I said, “Well, what did you think?” [laughter] He said, “Well, you don’t
know the number of calls we get from panicky parents who simply think that
if [their kids] get a sniffle, they’re dying of pneumonia.” [laughter] We had
quite a relationship with him. When Cricket had his tonsils out, he had a
little fur platypus that we had got up at Pier 1.
Wise: Fisherman’s Wharf?
Lyman: [00:06:37] Yes. When they were first importing stuff, and we had given him
this platypus for Christmas. Dr. [William Masters] came in and said, “What’s
his name?” And Cricket said, “His name is Platitude.” [laughter] And that
absolutely cemented the relationship.
Wise: Oh, that’s great. That is great. I love it.
Lyman: [00:07:01] It was quite wonderful. But anyway, then we moved into what
became the OPB House, which was Otis Pease and Barley House. [laughter]
Otis, of course, became our bosom friend, and Mary, and their four kids.
[Editor: Otis Pease was the Stanford University William Robertson Coe

149

Professor in History and American Studies, 1959-66, and a member of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, 1969-84.] Then in December, we had a chance
to buy the half a house adjacent to their house, looking at their house.
They’re all half houses along there. I thought, I can’t move again. We’d just
finished moving across the country.
Wise: You just had. Yes.
Lyman: [00:08:49] I went and looked at it, and it was [living room, dining room, sun
porch], four bedrooms and a sleeping porch, and one bath. That was the
problem. But the one bath, and a half bath downstairs in the kitchen. Very
badly designed, but wonderful. I mean the living room—have you ever been
in any of those houses?
Wise: I don’t think so. Trying to remember.
Lyman: [00:09:16] The living room stretches across the front of the house, and the
dining room stretches out back this way, and they’re like this. In the corner
of the living room, and the corner of the dining room, are two diagonal
fireplaces. [coughs] So if you have a fire going in both fireplaces, it looks like
a reflection. It’s the darndest thing. It was the first of those big duplexes
that were built by the father—or father-in-law of the professor [coughs] who
was moving in. He then proceeded to build a bunch of other ones. But this
was the only one that was built with a full basement and a full attic. The
others had no attic and they had only [coughs] overflow basements.
Wise: Do you remember the name of the person who was building it?
Lyman: [00:10:20] No. But somewhere in the archives (inaudible). Payson Treat was
the man.

150

Wise: Was the professor.
Lyman: [00:10:33] Professor. It was his father-in-law. Then it was the Hurlbuts—
John Hurlbut in the Law School, who—no, Edgar Robinson bought it from
Payson Treat. Edgar Robinson was the head of the History Department and
he owned it for quite a long time [coughs]. [Editor: Edgar Eugene Robinson
was the Margaret Byrne Professor of History, 1911-52; emeritus 1952-77 and
chairman of the department, 1935-1952.] Then the Hurlbuts bought it. [John
Bingham Hurlbut joined the Stanford Law faculty in 1937 as an associate
professor; became a full professor in 1942; served as assistant dean in 194142 and again in 1945-46; and in 1959 was named Jackson Eli Reynold
Professor of Law.] Then they bought a big house up on El Escarpado and
so we bought this. When I went to look at it, I just knew we couldn’t not
buy it. You know what we paid for it? Fifteen thousand, five hundred
dollars.
Wise: Oh, goodness.
Lyman: [00:11:35] It was such a relief because we could afford it. We had a loan
from the University. So it just—it was bliss.
Wise: Was that typical of the University to give loans to professors?
Lyman: [00:11:50] Yes. To [coughs] permanent appointments, not part-time
appointments.
Wise: Now, I wanted to fast-forward a little. We’ve touched a little on different
things that happened in Hoover House—

151

Lyman: [00:12:19] Yes. Well, but there was a long period—not a long period, but
between the time that Dick became provost, which was in ‘67, and that, was
a very ambiguous time.
Wise: Well, did you want to talk about that first?
Lyman: [00:12:38] Yes, because that was when Dick—I can’t remember how, you’d
have to ask him [coughs]—how he and Herb got together about who would
be the vice provost and who would be the provost. Herb and the Board of
Trustees said, “Up with this we will not put.” Herb Packer—the trustees
thought he was a radical.
Wise: Oh, really?
Lyman: [00:13:14] Because he’d been attacked by one of those dreadful right-wingers
who set his book on—I can’t remember now what, but Nancy [Packer] could
tell you all of that. [coughs] Or probably Dick could. But there was this
problem that the Board of Trustees would not accept him.
Wise: As provost?
Lyman: [00:13:43] We had just received an offer from Haverford. That’s when we
met in our living room with Bob Brown. Nancy, and Herb, and me, and
Dick.
Wise: I want to hear that. I don’t think we talked about that meeting.
Lyman: [00:14:12] Well, that’s when Dick said he would not accept the job of provost
if Herb was turned down. They hadn’t decided which would be provost and
which would be vice provost.
Wise: And Dick was saying he wouldn’t accept the provost position?
Lyman: [00:14:27] He wouldn’t do anything. He would take the job at Haverford.

152

Wise: If Herb—
Lyman: [00:14:32] If they turned Herb down.
Wise: For either or both?
Lyman: [00:14:35] For either.
Wise: For either.
Lyman: [00:14:38] Which is part of his strength. That’s when Wally called this rump
meeting of the Board of Trustees up at Hoover House.
Wise: But what would—
Lyman: [00:14:50] He wanted to wait until the next trustee meeting and bring it up at
his speed.
Wise: But wait a minute. Why were these particular people in your living room?
Lyman: [00:15:02] Because we were deciding what to do. And then we talked to Bob
Brown about the ethics of the whole situation. Robert McAfee Brown was—
yes—was the head of the Religious Studies Department and was the
inimitable ethicist and a very close friend. And he became a lot closer after
that experience. [laughter]
Wise: So he was there as a friend and advisor really.
Lyman: [00:16:16] Yes. And Sydney, his wife, was very much part of my life, because
she was the founder of New Ways to Work.
Wise: Oh, interesting. Okay.
Lyman: [00:16:28] We were doing parallel things. So there were lots of things in that.
Sydney gave us the bear knowing about the bears. So he was named McAfee
in honor of Sydney and Bob. [Editor: Jing Lyman is referencing a stuffed

153

bear given to the Lymans by Sydney to add to their collection of stuffed
bears.]
Wise: Great. All right. Wow. We haven’t really talked about those friendships.
Lyman: [00:16:53] Oh, God. I mean there were some wonderful friendships.
Wise: Let’s stay on track with the provost. There was a rump meeting of the
Board.
Lyman: [00:17:05] There was a rump meeting up at Hoover House. I guess Wally
sort of laid it on the line. Interestingly enough, Dave Packard was absolutely
dead set against it.
Wise: Against—
Lyman: [00:17:23] Well, against Herb, and therefore, against Dick. And Wally talked
him around, as only Wally could.
Wise: Why did Wally feel so strongly about him?
Lyman: [00:17:40] Well, he knew he was failing and he wanted people. In the first
place, the whole new Study of Education at Stanford was beginning to be in
the works. He wanted [coughs] one or the other of them to oversee that.
Wise: And he had a lot of respect for both of them.
Lyman: [00:18:07] Yes. And, of course, Herb was a brilliant, brilliant lawyer, and also
an ethicist. He was a very thoughtful and terrific man. And he did take over.
He said, “Look. What I would like to do is the Study of Education at
Stanford. You be provost, and let me be the vice provost and carry on this
Study of Education at Stanford.” So that’s what they did.
Wise: Did that make the Board happy somewhat?

154

Lyman: [00:18:52] Well, whether they were happy—they certainly weren’t sufficiently
happy so that when the question of the presidency came up, Parmer Fuller
called Dick. We were en route somewhere in the summertime. Parmer
called Dick and said, “You know, I should lay it on the line. We’re not going
to ask you to be president.” They just said they thought he wasn’t ready for
it. And he wasn’t. Well, then, of course, he got his—shall we say his back
teeth, or his feet wet, or whatever you want to say, when Pitzer came in and
was such a disaster. And as provost, Dick really had to take the reins, and
did.
Wise: He had no choice.
Lyman: [00:19:56] Well, no, because everybody was—if you go back to the speeches
that were made at Peter Bing’s behest a couple of years ago, Dick, [coughs]
and Don, [Donald Kennedy] and Gerhard, [Gerard Casper] and then John
[John Hennessey]. [coughs] Don was in the faculty at that point. He was
dealing with the Gombe situation. So Don knew Dick—they knew each
other very well. Don said Dick saved the University in this speech. Then
interestingly enough, Gerhard, who didn’t get along well with Don at all but
had enormous appreciation for what he saw Dick having done, said in this
speech, Dick Lyman saved the University.
[00:21:23] So—and in fact, he did, [laughter] in the sense that he managed to
make the necessary changes without losing sight of what this kind of
institution is really all about. That was a really critical factor in his tenure,
and particularly through that whole time of chaos, which it was, in those first

155

years of his—well, his—all of his years as provost, and then his first two
years of presidency.
Wise: Two years.
Lyman: [00:22:08] It was really from ‘68 through ‘72.
Wise: There was still stuff swirling around when I was there, though—
Lyman: [00:22:19] Oh, yes.
Wise: —in ’72, ’73.
Lyman: [00:22:21] Well, the early part of ’72, it still was. The interesting part of it, the
spring of ’72 was disaster area. That’s when we had huge fliers. Then we
went off in September on that leave of absence. That’s when we came back
in January after having—well, Herb’s dying, committing suicide, which was a
terrible blow, just as we were about to leave London. Then we went out to
Cliveden, which was where the campus was at that point. [Editor: Stanford
overseas studies campus in England] [laughter] And all of these kids who’d
just left the campus in the height of the revolution attacked Dick up hill and
down dale. I mean they were just unconscionable.
[00:23:16] He said, “I don’t know why I’m going back.” This was just as we
were about to go back. We got back and there was nothing. It had gone. It
had disappeared. It was unbelievable how fast it went. That was when we
tried to live in the house on El Escarpado, and decided that the Hoover
House was an empty shell if people weren’t living there.
Wise: And you and I have talked a lot about Hoover. But there were a couple
things that we hadn’t talked about. One was that you had a goal to transform

156

the Hoover House into a showcase for artwork—by artists from the
Stanford community. And—you’re laughing. But I wanted to—
Lyman: [00:24:44] Well, people thought it was a very funny thing to do, and I had
some weird exhibits.
Wise: I wanted to know. What inspired you? Was it difficult to carry off? And
then, what sort of artwork did you bring in?
Lyman: [00:24:58] What inspired me was knowing that there were a lot of faculty
wives who were doing things in the creative arts that never got any attention.
One of the things I did ironically with that art show was to exhibit people
who’d been working against the odds with little kids in the house and blah,
blah, blah, and had never had an opportunity to show their work. Bobbi
Gunther was one of them. A very accomplished artist now, but then, she
had no recognition at all. [Editor: Barbara Gunther, printmaker] [00:25:43] I
had an exhibit of some of her things. I did this for a whole group of people.
Some of them were very well established in the Art Department. I started
out with a few big things from the Art Department and they were weird. I
mean Nathan Oliveira and so on. They were not things I would live with,
but I did it only for three months at a time.
Wise: Three months at a time.
Lyman: [00:26:19] In that big living room in the Hoover House, there were sliding
doors that closed off the entryway that you could reach from the front door
so that you could go back and forth to the kitchen from the front door
without being in the middle of the living room. There was a huge
Coromandel screen across that. I didn’t want to be responsible for it. It’s a

157

gorgeous thing. It’s somewhere now. I think parts of it may be
somewhere—maybe at the Buck House but in any case, I didn’t want to be
responsible—we were having things thrown at us all the time.
[00:27:09] I didn’t want to be responsible for something as irreplaceable as
that. So I said, “Take it away. We’ll close those doors.” I put a gallery wall
across those doors. That became the central hanging place and then I just
hung things around different parts of the house. It was all on that level
because we lived up on the top. Those rooms had been designed for the
Hoover boys, and nobody had ever lived up there except kids. And Dick
had his study. I can show you on that picture out there in the hall.
[00:27:54] He had his study sort of in the middle, and I had one room that
opened out onto that huge terrace on that level. Then he had, as his
bedroom, just down at the top of the stairway was a little hall and there was a
small room. I had a desk at one end of it overlooking the front door. Mrs.
Hoover used to sit there and she could see who was coming. If it was
someone that she wanted to see, she could slide down the little pair of back
stairs and into her dressing room and come out in through the bedroom to
greet people. If she didn’t [Laughter] want to be bothered with the people,
she just stayed there. It was perfect because you could see the whole thing
going on, but you couldn’t be seen. So that worked for me.
[00:28:47] Dick had his bed in there. Then I had a room which, since I’ve
always worked in my bed with a big [pad] and my stuff spread out all over it,
and my usual piles. I had my telephone on a twenty-five foot cord and I
could take it out to that terrace and work out there all day long and watch the

158

sun change. I would get up—there’s a beautiful pool at that house below the
kitchen, but not where anybody can look into it, which was good because I
would get up—we had no live-in help, but we had students living in the
garage apartment. They simply understood that at six in the morning, I
would get up and go swimming without my bathing suit—
Wise: [Laughter]
Lyman: [00:29:44] —and I would swim my laps for half an hour or more, and then I
would put on my bathrobe and walk the dog. Or rather, I guess I walked the
dog first and she often came out and sat there while I swam. Then I would
go up and make Dick’s breakfast and my breakfast. I would take my
breakfast upstairs to my room and eat my breakfast in the bed after all of this
other stuff. Dick would go off on his business, and that was that.
[00:30:22] But it worked for us, but the art would—the only time people
came onto that level was at the big reception for graduates when we opened
up the side door, so they could come through that upstairs hall and down a
circular staircase. That circular staircase I once slid down on my—I’m
convinced that was the genesis of my first hip operation—
Wise: Oh, my goodness.
Lyman: [00:31:03] —because I slid all the way down those stairs—blblblbllb—like
this, and I had a bruise from here to here. [Laugher] But I loved that house,
actually. I hated it when we first moved in. There was no place that I could
go and shout and get everybody for meals. We had a deal with the boys.
The boys said we will not move into—the girls were off at college by that

159

time –and the boys said we will not move into that place with you—“that
place,” as they described it, unless you be cook.
Wise: Yes, I remember you mentioning that.
Lyman: [00:31:40] So that was when—and I did—I cooked all the way through the
ten years if we were not entertaining. It just worked for the—worked
extremely [well]—as it turned out. Of course, we had this stream of students
who took over when our kids left. I mean they lived downstairs, and they
lived in the garage apartment.
Wise: In the house, or in the garage?
Lyman: [00:32:07] [Both.] They’d live there in return for work in the house when we
gave parties.
Wise: Let me get back to the artwork a little bit.
Lyman: [00:32:16] I picked them out.
Wise: Did you do that for the whole time that you were there?
Lyman: [00:32:20] Yes.
Wise: And you picked them out.
Lyman: [00:32:23] I did two things. I did the artwork, and I did all the flowers. We
would schedule a series of events in quick succession so that I could do—
because it [the flowers] was a big job. It was a day-long job.
Wise: With the artwork, every three months you were having to choose new—
Lyman: [00:32:49] Approximately every three months, yes.
Wise: Yes. And so—
Lyman: [00:32:51] I very quickly discovered I couldn’t get into the alumni bag,
because that was going to open up a bucket of worms. So I chose faculty

160

and staff family—children, wives, husbands, whatever, but they all had to
have a direct, current association with Stanford.
Wise: What about the students?
Lyman: [00:33:25] Yes. Yes.
Wise: Oh, you did do student work?
Lyman: [00:33:27] But not as much. The one thing—that’s when Leo Holub—did
you ever know Leo Holub?
Wise: I certainly know the name.
Lyman: [00:33:36] Leo Holub is a photographer. I guess he just died. But he was a
wonderful man. He’s the one who got Alida Rockefeller, who was his
student, to take a photography course. He set up in the Photography
Department, thanks to Alida, and I guess support from her father. I said to
Leo, “I would like to have an exhibit of your things,” and he said okay. He
said, “But I have to bring them up so you can see them.” I said, “Well, that’s
fine. You can bring them up so I can pick out the things that—and where
they go.” I did this with every single artist. They came to the house and
decided with me. I would look at some of their things. Then they would
come to the house and we would decide the location so that they felt
[comfortable]—and this was something nobody ever did for artists. So that
was fun.
Wise: So they felt honored or consulted.
Lyman: [00:35:01] It was often an opportunity for them that they’d never had. So it
was a good deal for them from that standpoint. But Leo came up with his
assistant and these boxes of carefully framed photographs. Then he said to

161

me, “Now, I have to tell you that these are not my photographs, these are my
students.” He said, “I won’t give them to you unless you promise to give a
party when we’re ready to take them down, if you give a party for all of these
kids so they can see them hanging here.” This is typical of Leo. I said, “Oh,
I can buy that.”
[Laughter]
Lyman: [00:35:50] That’s terrific. I think that’s a great idea. So we did. Did I show
you the one that I love?
Wise: Yes.
Lyman: [00:35:58] In there. Okay. That’s Alida’s picture. That’s the one that we had
hanging in our apartment in New York.
Wise: Well, why don’t you say for the [recording] which one it is, though.
Lyman: [00:36:10] Oh. It’s a picture of a young woman, a nude, and she’s sitting with
her arms around her knees in the grass. As Alida explained to me, well I
didn’t even realize that, there were grasses that were just following the lovely
line of her back. You see this beautiful fluid thing and her hair sort of
flowing, and then this incredibly earthy hand with dirty fingernails clutching
her arm. [Laughter] I absolutely love it. She was so astonished. I said, when
they came to see, I said, “You know, the one sad thing is that I can’t keep
anything that people do because I love them so.” And she said, “But can I—
could I give it to you?”
[00:37:14] I said, “Well, I suppose so. I’d never thought about that.” She
said, “Well, I would like to give it to you.” So that’s how it came. Then it

162

was her mother seeing it in our apartment in New York who told her, and
she then said, “I now really believe you liked it.”—
[Laughter] which is funny.
Wise: Now, did you have help finding the artists?
Lyman: [00:37:37] Yes. I went to the Art Department people. I asked people in the
various departments and once the word got out that I was doing it, people
would let me know if somebody was doing interesting things. I started out
focusing on faculty wives because I was so convinced that there was no
recognition of the talents of faculty wives. And they were all wives in those
days. And Dick was whole-heartedly behind me on this. He didn’t always
like the exhibits, but—[Laughter]
Wise: Right. I understand.
Lyman: [00:38:16] And the kids thought they were hysterical. Especially—there was
one—did I tell you about this? Called The House Beautiful? It was a cocoon—
a huge cocoon in a glass—Plexiglas box?
Wise: No.
Lyman: [00:38:32] You looked through the end of the cocoon and there was a little
house—paper pieces of a house inside. It was done by an artist who’s still, as
far as I know, practicing in Palo Alto. One of our [house event waiters], who
was also a swain of one of our kids, [laughter] brought his dog one day, and
the dog lifted his leg on the case of this thing. Fortunately, we caught him as
he was starting to do it and he didn’t actually do it. But he was all prepared
to. I thought the kids were going to die of laughter.
Wise: Oh, of course.

163

Lyman: [00:39:16] They thought it was so appropriate. [Laughter]
Wise: Because they did not like this one, I take it.
Lyman: [00:39:20] They did not like this one.
Wise: Now, this may be hard to answer. But of all the projects and groups and
events that you were involved in on campus, what do you see as your major
accomplishments?
Lyman: [00:39:42] Managing to create a space that served the University in a social
way, not a formal educational way, that it created the ambiance of support
for the institution. The people who came, and there were so many different
kinds of people who came, and what I wanted to help, was to show that this
was a functioning institution in the University, but it was geared on social
pleasure. Reasonable food, reasonable drinks—not a lot. And I kept a really
close tab on the drinks that went around because I didn’t want people going
out—that was just when they were beginning to lower the boom on people
drinking and driving. So I got my bartenders to be very, very cagey about
that. But I really wanted an informal and pleasant atmosphere. It was unlike
anything anybody had ever dreamed of, and probably unlike anything that
happens now.
Wise: For the whole house, you mean?
Lyman: [00:41:18] No, for the entertainment part of it. I really wanted to make a
place where people felt comfortable and enjoyed each other and learned
about each other. It was wonderful because we had only students who were
helping wait on tables, so there was interaction between the wait people and
the guests. It was a convivial environment and that was my goal, to make it

164

not too stiff, not too rigid, but always aesthetically pleasing, [Laughter]
because the aesthetics have always been such a huge factor for me.
Wise: Did you set out beforehand to think that through, or did it sort of evolve?
Lyman: [00:42:21] No. Listen. This all happened to me. I mean, I never dreamed of
having—of living—neither of us did, of living this kind of a life. When
wonderful Lyle Nelson—did you know Lyle Nelson?
Wise: Oh, yes.
Lyman: [00:42:45] Well, Corrine Nelson, his wife, was one of the people who advised
me. When Dick became provost, I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know
how to entertain—I mean we’ve—I had entertained our guests, and I would
sweat buckets making a dinner for eight people and doing it all myself, and
having it all be pleasant, and relaxed, and attractive, and good food. But
suddenly, to do it for loads of other people and I didn’t know how to do
that. And we were involved in stuff, and of course, it was a crazy
environment because that was the beginning—we moved into El Escarpado
in ‘67 just after Dick became provost. Then all hell broke loose. And we
had a security guard on the house. I told you about the cars.
Wise: Yes, you did.
Lyman: [00:43:53] And the move and so on. It was a very different kind of
environment. I didn’t know how to do those things. I had to learn. And
Corrine was wonderful. There were several other people. Marjorie Manning,
who was then the wife of the Dean of the Law School, Bayless Manning.
But he subsequently divorced her and several others after that. But that’s
another issue.

165

Wise: [Laughter]
Lyman: [00:44:23] But we still see her. She’s in Bennington, Vermont, interestingly
enough.
(misc.)
Wise: Jing, we never get through (talking over each other)—
Lyman: [00:44:46] I know. Well, the trouble is we keep getting me sidetracked. I’m
terrible in that respect.
Wise: But this has been good because you’ve talked about a lot of your friends and
the people at Stanford. This has been very—
Lyman: [00:44:57] One of the things that was interesting was that when [Dick]
became president, the friendship—we couldn’t have the kinds of intimate
dinners that we used to have with six to eight people.
Wise: Is that because it would show favoritism, or—
Lyman: [00:45:17] We didn’t have time. You did have to be a little careful about
favoritism, but that wasn’t a big issue. We had people that we’ve—you
know, one of the huge strengths that I think Dick brought to this job, with
so many impossible demanding things, was his ability to attract people to
work with him who were, as he described—he always said that, “He’s
smarter than I am.” They were probably at least as smart as he was, and
different. But he also could let them go.
Wise: You mean let them go to do what they needed to do.
Lyman: [00:46:12] Yes. To move on to the next thing.
Wise: Oh, you mean to leave.

166

Lyman: [00:46:16] Yes. He did not allow people to be sycophants. He did not get a
coterie of people who were yes people. He had a bunch of people, and some
of them moved on for various reasons. Some of them stayed. Some of them
had medical problems. There were— someone like Joel Smith who had
psychiatric problems [Editor: Joe Smith became dean of students at Stanford
in 1967 and two years later was named president of Denison College in Ohio.
He returned to Stanford in 1976 as vice president for development.]. But
[Dick] was able to enlist the strengths of a wide variety of people in a fairly
close working environment, and then let them go out and do their own thing.
This worked with some of the faculty members, too, which was very
important. The interesting thing is that you talk to some of the people who
were the young Turks, as we called them in those days, and particularly in the
English Department, who came to realize what an incredible strength he had.
They said, “However we may have disagreed with him, he was always fair,
and he was always to be trusted.” That was an incredible statement. I
watched this going on, and it was an incredibly growing experience for both
of us, really.
[00:48:07] As I think I told you, when we went on that Danforth leave, and I
wasn’t at all sure what was going to happen when we sat down opposite each
other. And it was so wonderful and it’s gone right on being wonderful.
[Laughter]
Wise: That’s great. Were there other accomplishments that you looked to separate
from the Hoover House, but other sort of (talking over each other)—

167

Lyman: [00:48:34] Apparently I made a kind of a mark as being someone who was
accessible. If they couldn’t get to Dick, they could get to me and I would
raise the questions. They were all scared to death of Dick so they would
come to me with problems. Sometimes I would say, “Well, you know, that
can be handled by someone,” or “That’s not Dick’s bag,” or “I could see
what he might think about this,” and so on. I did a certain amount of
filtering. There were a lot of people who wanted access, shall we say, and
sometimes not for very honorable reasons. [Laughter]
Wise: Well, they’re out there, people like that.
Lyman: [00:49:28] Oh, they’re always out there. That’s one of the things you learn,
and you have to learn how to make a judgment about which people are out
there and which people are really reliable, which is one of the reasons why
Bob Brown was so great.
Wise: Yes. Absolutely.
Lyman: [00:49:47] He would tell you exactly how he thought, but he also would be
incredibly understanding of the issues.
Wise: Were there things that you wished you had had the time to pursue while you
were at Stanford during those years that you didn’t get to?
Lyman: [00:50:10] Well, I was out there working in the highways and the byways all
that time. That was when Colleen Cuthbertson took off on me. I think we
talked about that.
Wise: Yes. But I mean were there things that—in the back of your mind you
thought, oh, I recognize there’s only a limit to how much time and energy I
have, but if I had another lifetime, I would have wanted to get involved in X.

168

Lyman: [00:50:40] I can’t think of—at this point. I would have liked to have carried
on more with the organizations that I was involved with. [00:50:55] Oh, well,
I’ve always wished I had time to learn to type, but [it] turned out that wasn’t
going to work—
Wise: [Laughter]
Lyman: [00:51:02] —for whatever reason. No, I probably would have liked to have
had—in fact, interestingly enough, when I could paint was only when we had
been at Barred Islands for a while, and I had cut loose and everything wasn’t
impinging. That was when I could paint again. It wasn’t anything
professional, but it was just satisfying. I remember when I came back from
the Nairobi conference for women in ’85, [Editor: Third World Conference
on Women] and I had a lot of photographs of the wonderful women
[00:51:53] because I did all these things that were outside the conference. I
was staying with a Rockefeller representative and his family there, which
meant I had a room all to myself when [Nairobi] was just an ant hill. I got
chauffeured back and forth every day to whatever the location was I wanted
to go to. Then I went with Alberta Arthurs, [Editor: Alberta Arthurs is
former Director for Arts and Humanities for the Rockefeller Foundation]
who was a program officer for the foundation, out to Mount Kenya and saw
this budding waterworks. It was absolutely fascinating. I had a camera with
me and I took pictures.
When I came back, particularly in the markets—[with] just having spent that
time when I was in college in Mexico in this little village [where] the market
[was] such a central part of what was happening in the village—[00:53:02] to

169

see these markets with all their fascinating foods and their creative crafts and
so forth, it was—
I’ve always had an interest in crafts. I guess the art show was sort of to take
care of my leanings along that line. I debated when going to graduate school
of going to occupational therapy, and decided that that was too technical for
me, that I was much more interested in the creative side of it. That’s when I
decided to go into teaching, or at least to find out what teaching with little
kids could do, because you were watching it all sort of begin. But that’s sort
of—I always wished I had more time and space to do that. I watched these
other faculty wives trying to carve out their space and it wasn’t easy.
Wise: No. No, it’s not.
Lyman: [00:54:21] I don’t think I had the talent to do it anyway, so that didn’t matter.
What I apparently did have the talent for was bringing people together. I
always said I painted with people and not with things, because I was able to
get people—I would see somebody doing this, and there was somebody
doing this over here, and there was no communication. I would find ways to
get them into communication, and so something would begin to happen.
And I did do that. It’s—[Laughter]—did I tell you the story about my friend
in the Mayflower lobby in Washington?
Wise: No.
Lyman: [00:55:05] I was with a group of people, and I suddenly saw someone who
was part of another group, and I brought this person over and introduced
them, and then went around introducing everybody, and simply giving a little
capsule about what the role each person was playing. And—[Laughter]—

170

this guy looked at me and he said, “My God, Jing, you’re such a social
amoeba.” [Laughter]
Lyman: [00:55:33] And it was absolutely true.
Wise: Oh, my gosh.
Lyman: [00:55:36] I thought my family was going to die when I told them this.
Wise: [Laughter] That’s funny.
Lyman: [00:55:41] They got fed to the teeth with my social amoeba-ism. [Laughter]
But that sort of the thing—my ten years at Hoover House really cultivated
that. Because what I would do in those environments was to try and put
people together who would—and I put [in] a lot of thought—I handled all
the seating charts for those things—inevitably there was a last-minute
change. I did that. I supervised that, although I had people—staff people
like Marjorie Manning who also helped me, but that was—the other thing,
very interesting, did I tell you this, that I insisted that they put women’s
names on their labels?
Wise: Hmmm—you did.
Lyman: [00:56:41] If I didn’t do anything else, I got women recognized in their own
rights. That was not unimportant, and especially at that time it was a useful
thing to do. I stirred up the Development Office fairly significantly. Not
always successfully, but—[Laughter].
Wise: Yes. Well—
Lyman: [00:57:15] They needed it.
Wise: —it was a time women were just starting to think about those things.
Lyman: [00:57:19] Yes.

171

Wise: Or maybe even a little before. You might have been a little before.
Lyman: [00:57:23] Just a tad.
Wise: And do you have any memories or specifically special guests or experiences
that happened over those ten years of hosting people, entertaining?
Lyman: [00:57:53] Yes. I remember particularly—I want to say Eban—he was a—a
very high mucky-muck in Israel.
Wise: Oh, right. Abba?
Lyman: [00:58:09] Abba Eban. You’re right. He came as our guest. And I was
enchanted by him. Elie Wiesel was amazing. That was the night when
Gertrude Levison, who was the wife of a long-time Stanford—he was one of
the founders of the Stanford Associates. [Editor: She is most likely Gertrude
Guggenheim Levison, wife of Robert Mark Levison, Sr.] Just a hugely
important family, and a generational repeat. She was so busy talking with
Wiesel as they were leaving the dining room that she stepped off those three
steps between the dining room and the living room without ever looking at it
and just went down—bang. This was a woman who was then in her
seventies.
Wise: Oh, my goodness.
Lyman: [00:59:09] And I thought, oh, God. She was also the woman who was giving
me Iceland poppies for my flower arrangements from her own garden. I just
thought, oh, I can’t bear this. She hopped up again. When I called her
afterward and I said, “Gertrude, I really want to know. Are you really all
right?” She said, “Yes. I’m a little bruised, but I’m okay.” [Laughter] She
just was so fascinated by this man.

172

Wise: Right. She just didn’t pay attention. What about artists or musicians or—
Lyman: [00:59:49] We had one concert, John Chowning, who was doing experimental
music. [Editor: John M. Chowning (b. 1934) is an American composer,
musician, inventor and professor best known for his work at Stanford
University and his discovery of FM synthesis.] That living room has this
coved ceiling. This was before quadraphonic sound -- he set up four
speakers in the living room. We turned off all the lights except the little cove
lights in the ceiling, and people listened to his music and it rolled around in
that room. It was breathtaking. That’s the only word for it, it was just
unbelievable. That was a positive one. Then I arranged for a wonderful trio
to play for a party, and nobody listened. They played magnificently. I just
was sick.
Wise: It was like background music or something?
Lyman: [01:00:52] Yes. I mean that’s the way people were treating it.
Wise: Whew.
Lyman: [01:00:56] It made me absolutely sick because they were brilliant. So I
learned you have to be a little careful how you set these things up. You can’t
have it connected with alcohol.
Wise: Were they before John Chowning?
Lyman: [01:01:17] I can’t remember when John Chowning came in.
Wise: Because I was just wondering if you’d learned from them to then make it a
concert with the lights off and—
Lyman: [01:01:27] No. No. I don’t think so. I mean, it wasn’t a very practical
situation because it was pretty dark down here. [Laughter] People really had

173

to sit and listen, and it wasn’t—mostly the parties we were giving were not
the kind of situation where you sat and listened unless it was specifically a
performance.
Wise: Oh, his was a performance, not a party.
Lyman: [01:01:59] Yes, in effect and it was almost an experimental performance.
Wise: So you just realized you couldn’t mix any of that.
Lyman: [01:02:09] Yes. Well, you can’t mix social interaction and alcohol and good
music. Well, of course, I was brought up by my grandfather who was a
musician, who wouldn’t even let us wiggle during a concert. You had to
really pay attention. I don’t follow that anymore. I obviously listen to music
while doing other things.
Wise: Not like that.
Lyman: [01:02:49] Not like that. Not with good, live music playing with
accomplished artists, and people just—blah, blah, blah, blah—all the way
through it. It just—agh—it was awful. Absolutely awful. But—no. And I
can’t remember—you know, we didn’t have the Queen as Don and Jeanne
[Kennedy] had the Queen. Then the weekend after the Queen was when
Jenny and Greg had their wedding there, so we had all the Queen’s flowers.
Wise: [Laughter] For the wedding.
Lyman: [01:03:33] And Greg’s Kansas relatives signed the guestbook under Elizabeth
X. [Laughter]
Wise: That’s great. [Laughter]
Lyman: [01:03:47] Elizabeth R. X. Excuse me—Regina. But—[Laughter]—it was so
funny.

174

Wise: Oh, that’s so funny.
Lyman: [01:03:53] I mean they were just boggle-eyed. [Laughter]
Wise: Oh, that’s funny. [Laughter] Well, you’ve talked a little about important
lessons you learned. But were there other things you haven’t talked about
that were lessons you learned when you were—
Lyman: [01:04:13] At Hoover?
Wise: Well, First Lady at Stanford, just in general.
Lyman: [01:04:17] Boy, yes.
Wise: Not just at Hoover.
Lyman: [01:04:19] You learned to be very careful about what you said about anybody
because whatever it was you said was going to get repeated, and it was going
to get distorted. So you just learned to be very, very cagey about what you
said. And I learned time in motion. I mean how do you get this done in this
amount of time and achieve the goal that you’re after? I also learned what
my limits were. I learned, for instance, that I had to do the flowers-[01:05:15] What I did was to do a basic flower arrangement, and then I would
go down and get the flowers that wouldn’t hold up. I would pull out the
things that were dying and stick in new ones so that you had—the basis was
still there, but it looked fresh. [Laughter]
Wise: So shortcuts sort of.
Lyman: [01:05:43] Yes. But I learned—you know, I learned how to entertain. I made
awful mistakes as I was learning. I can’t tell you at this point any of them,
but I’m sure they were there.
Wise: How did you process that?

175

Lyman: [01:06:06] We were so damn busy, we didn’t have time to process it. It just
was going all the time between the kids and us, and the University, and the
various issues, and the things I was doing outside the University.
Wise: Yes, which you continued.
Lyman: [01:06:29] And one of the things that I learned was—and Dick was so helpful
about that—who are the people I should go to to ask if I could do
something. I had to be very careful about the entertainment at Hoover
House. There were certain things that made sense for me to do. There were
some things we did and we paid for them. But mostly we didn’t, well, mostly
they were things that did have some—if we were going to do something that
wasn’t right for the Hoover House, we did it somewhere else.
Wise: So you mean to ask in terms of sort of the ethical way, sort of the perception
way.
Lyman: [01:07:18] Oh, yes. All of those things.
Wise: All of those things. So those would be different people that you would talk
to.
Lyman: [01:07:22] Yes. But, interestingly enough, one of the people who was very
useful to me was Bob Rosenzweig, who was a very controversial person here.
[Editor: Robert Rosenzweig is former vice president for public affairs from
1975 to 1983.] But Bob was one of the people who would really tell me what
he thought, and what he thought was appropriate, and what he thought was
not appropriate. And he did. Ray Bacchetti continued to be just a pillar as a
friend and of course, went on being a pillar as the person who took over our
kids’—our grandchildren’s trusts as the non-family trustee. [Editor: Ray

Bacchetti served as Stanford vice provost and vice president for planning and
management.] He just lives down the hall here—
Wise: [Laughter] That’s helpful.
Lyman: [01:08:09] —which is fun.
Wise: Yes. Wow. Such deep experiences.
Lyman: [01:08:16] They were. And very profound and a lot of it—you know, it’s
very hard to remember. [Laughter] Frankly.
Wise: Yes. Now, what—in terms of leaving—
(misc.)
Lyman: [01:08:33] I think we better finish up if we can because it’s almost five.
Wise: Oh, wow. Okay.
Lyman: [01:08:39] Yes.
Wise: Can we do one more question? One more. That’s it. Leaving Stanford—
Lyman: [01:08:47] Leaving Stanford?
Wise: Yes. Dick leaving the presidency. Was that a decision you made together?
And what were the factors involved?
Lyman: [01:08:57] He told them when he was appointed president that he would not
serve longer than ten years. At that point, most of the presidents weren’t
serving two years.
Wise: Right. [Laughter]
Lyman: [01:09:16] But he made it very clear that he was going to leave at the end of
ten years, that he thought that they should be recycled. And that’s why he
brought Don[Kennedy] back from the Food and Drug Administration—I
mean from the FDA, to be provost when Bill Miller moved over to the—

177

[Editor: William F. Miller is Herbert Hoover Professor of Public and Private
Management, Emeritus; Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus; and
former Provost of Stanford University.]
Wise: Where’d he go?
Lyman: [01:09:44] SRI.
Wise: Yes, that’s right.
Lyman: [01:09:47] He brought Don in to be provost because he wanted to begin to
groom somebody. He said it’s the trustees’ decision, but at least somebody
would have a leg up and could either be a support to the new person coming
in. But you know, he and Don only served together for about a year, and
then he left. And there was the question of what we were going to do when
we grew up. I was still up to my eyeballs at that point in—what was I up to
my eyeballs in at that point?
Wise: Housing issues probably.
Lyman: [01:10:28] No. Well, yes, but not to the same extent—that’s when I was
really involved with the women’s issues, and the Women and
Foundations/Corporate Philanthropy. I was very much involved with that
and something else that wasn’t housing. But then it was after we went to
New York that I got into the micro-enterprise thing.
Wise: Which we’ll get to another time.
Lyman: [01:10:59] Yes—oh. Okay. [Laughter]
Wise: Or maybe we won’t. [Laughter] I don’t know. But did you—was there a
time, do you think, when you both regretted that he had made that deadline?
Or did you always just work within that framework?

178

Lyman: [01:11:15] No.
Wise: You always knew it was going be ten years?
Lyman: [01:11:16] And I think his time at Rockefeller was very difficult and very
different. It was very difficult because the [Rockefeller] trustees didn’t know
how to hire people, and didn’t know how to give them the kind of support
that a leading staff person needs and that was the problem of the Foundation
and the trustees. I mean they’d had hell for several incarnations at that point.
They had an acting president and so on. Actually, [Dick] was up for the Ford
Foundation, and that’s when Frank Thomas, as the first black trustee—
director—was [selected] and did a magnificent job, I have to say, as head of
the Ford Foundation. [01:12:09] But it came down to Frank or Dick, and
they took—because Frank was black, I think it made the decision.
Wise: While he was still president of Stanford, if you were at some point, let’s say
year nine, saying, oh, I wish we hadn’t made this promise—
Lyman: [01:12:30] No. I—that was not—
Wise: —that he was going to leave.
Lyman: [01:12:33] That was not the issue. I mean, I was entirely supportive of what
he was doing, and was very pleased that he was coming into the field of
philanthropy because I was already there. But what I never did recover from,
and that’s why we came back, was that I hated to leave California. This
became my community, and I understood up and down the Peninsula how
things worked in both the housing field, the women’s issues, the
philanthropy, you name it. I had a grip on this area, as it related to the rest of

179

the world, but still it was this area. I never got that kind of connection when
we went back to New York.
Wise: And how long were you in New York?
Lyman: [01:13:28] Eight years—well, I was there for nine years, because I got myself
involved in [Women for Economic Revitalization at the] HUB while Dick
was getting ready to come back here.
Wise: So were you ready to leave Stanford? Or was it—I guess I’m trying to
understand—
Lyman: [01:13:49] Well, I was ready to go with Dick. And New York has always
been the [center] of philanthropy, so that wasn’t that bad. And I was setting
up—
Wise: But before he knew he was going into philanthropy, before he had any offers
on the table—I mean—well, let me put it this way. Did you always—the
whole time you were living at Hoover and working as the wife as the
president—
Lyman: [01:14:18] We weren’t thinking about it.
Wise: You weren’t thinking about it.
Lyman: [01:14:21] No.
Wise: But you sort of had it in the back of your mind this is only a ten-year deal.
Lyman: [01:14:25] No, we knew it was only a ten-year deal, but we weren’t thinking
about what are we going to do when we grow up, except the interesting thing
was, that was when we bought the house in Vermont in 1978. We tried to
sell it. The family all came together with my brothers and we all agreed it
should be sold. Then I thought, you know, this is crazy. This has all our

180

family roots in this house. Why don’t we buy it? So when we found it could
be sold for seventy thousand dollars—or actually, the realtor was saying not
seventy, but we ended up paying my mother seventy thousand dollars for the
property. It was just an investment. The idea was that we would keep it with
tenants at that point. But within a year and a half we were back there—
Wise: You were there. [Laughter]
Lyman: [01:15:31] —and it became this heavenly place. It’s where Dick—when he
left Rockefeller, he took six weeks and just went up there by himself, and just
vegetated and explored and read. And it was at that point—he’d been
somewhat dubious about it—but at that point, that clenched it for him. So
that was when, in ‘89, we decided to really begin to rehab it, because it was
falling apart at the seams. And that’s what we’d been doing.
Wise: So he walked right into a position from Stanford.
Lyman: [01:16:20] Yes. But there had been a certain amount of trauma related to the
search at Ford and the search at Rockefeller, and so on. So it wasn’t just
all—but he did do that. He was going back there to get the lay of the land
even before he left Stanford.
Wise: And were you already there?
Lyman: [01:16:46] No. I was busy trying to [coughs] figure out what to do with ten
years of accumulation of us and our kids and all the kids who’d lived in the
house while we were there. [coughs] We moved Dick’s mother’s house
almost lock, stock, and barrel out of New Haven [coughs] and into the
basement—into the playroom at Hoover House so she could decide what
she wanted when she moved in here, and then we would get rid of the rest.

181

So we had all of this stuff. Fortunately, I had a young man who was a former
dancer—I mean is a dancer, a folk dancer, [coughs] whom I’d met through
Tim, who became our house manager. He was an extremely well-organized
person and I would just go through and say, “Jeff, we need to do this, we
need to do this, we need to do this,” and it would be done.
