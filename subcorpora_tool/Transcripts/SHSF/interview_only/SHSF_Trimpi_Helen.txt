Humburg: This is Judee Humburg and I’m interviewing Helen Pinkerton Trimpi on
Thursday, March 17, 2016, in her apartment in Grass Valley. This is all part
of the Oral History Program with Stanford Historical Society. Thank you for
your time again today.
Trimpi: [00:00:16] It’s my pleasure.
Humburg: Before we actually start talking about your Stanford career as a student and as
a member of the faculty, I’d like you to talk a little bit about your early years.
You were born in Montana?
Trimpi: [00:00:32] In Butte, Montana, which is famous for only one thing--the
copper mines. My family were locals. My father and grandfather had
homesteaded near Jackson, Montana, and he [my father] was brought up
there. My mother was born and raised in Butte. She was an orphan and spent
her early years in an orphanage, which, of course, colored her life. My father

13

was in World War I, and then he went into mining as soon as he came back
in 1919. He met my mother and they were married in the 1920s in Butte, I
believe. I was the third child. I had two older brothers, Dan and Charles, and
one younger sister, Sharon, and I was born in 1927. We lived in Butte out on
the flat. I went to the local schools. I think I got a very good education there.
Montana was a little bit behind California, which means it was not very
progressive.
In school, we read a lot of poetry, and we read novels. I went
through all the grades until about 1938; my father was killed in a mining
accident. My mother had to go to work immediately. She had been an
orphan, she’d been adopted into a family who later lived in Washington
State-Humburg: That’s how you got to Washington.
Trimpi: [00:02:01] Yes. Mother had difficulties finding jobs in Butte because she had
no training in anything. Then came along 1942 or 1943 and her foster sister
in Washington State invited her to go to Mount Vernon and said there’s lots
of work there. And there was. It was during the war and everybody could
find jobs. She took my sister and myself, we got on a train and went to
Mount Vernon. Mother got a job and I got a job for the summer. I went to
Mount Vernon High School.
Humburg: I think I read something about when you were in school there, you had some
very helpful people and experiences.
Trimpi: [00:02:36] Yes. I had had two years at Butte High School, very good years. I
took a year of Latin and could not continue it at Mount Vernon. That was

14

the only drawback to that high school. The teachers there were just fine. One
of them took an interest in me and thought I should perhaps become a
journalist. He steered me into going to Stanford because he had gotten his
degree in journalism at Stanford. I didn’t have the money to do that but
mother said, “Okay, I’ll move down to Palo Alto and we can live there and
you can live at home.” In those days, you could still live at home if you lived
with your parents. You couldn’t rent a room [by yourself] and go to Stanford.
We went down on the train.
I should say both of my brothers were in the service during the war.
After they got out of the service, they came back to Butte, took one look at
it, and then they came down to California. By that time, mother and I were in
California. Anyway, mother and I moved down in 1944 and I took the
Stanford entrance test and passed that. I had good letters from all my
teachers, and also practically the entire student body was girls because all the
men were in the war. I think if it had not been the men were all away, I
would have had more trouble getting in. I’m grateful. The war gave us work
and also I got into Stanford. Maybe I would, I don’t know. Anyhow, that’s
how I got down to Stanford. I wanted to go there.
Humburg: So your teacher really influenced you in terms of being excited about going
to Stanford?
Trimpi: [00:04:28] He certainly did and he was a very fine teacher. He’s not alive
anymore, of course. I’m very grateful to him.
Humburg: Do you remember his name?

15

Trimpi: [00:04:36] Yes, Raymond Cowell was his name. He was a good guy. He
taught journalism and civics.
Humburg: In your high school?
Trimpi: [00:04:44] Yes, in the high school in Mount Vernon.
Humburg: When you got to Stanford, what did you study?
Trimpi: [00:04:50] You had to take certain courses in English. I wanted to be an
English major. Everyone had to take English composition. I had friends in
the same freshman class [and they] said, “You’ve got to take a course from
Yvor Winters. You’ve got to take his English composition. So I did and that
changed my whole career because I moved from journalism over to English
literature. I wanted to be in literature.
Humburg: What was it about Professor Winters’ course [that made you change to
English literature]?
Trimpi: [00:05:20] He asked very serious philosophical questions and expected us to
write essays on them. He made us think for ourselves. He almost always gave
me a B, which was very nice. He also taught poetry.
There was another teacher there who influenced me besides Winters.
That was J. V. Cunningham--Jim Cunningham [James Vincent Cunningham].
He was a graduate student in Classics and he was a poet, already a very wellknown poet, as Winters was. Winters was a very well-known poet and critic.
Cunningham gave a course in writing narrative prose and then he sent me
back to Winters.
I took a course in the writing of poetry every year thereafter with
Winters. Also Winters steered me into the best teachers at Stanford in the

16

humanities. We had to take Western Civilization, of course. That was
wonderful. He steered us into two different teachers of medieval philosophy.
One of them was Friedrich Strothmann, who was a German émigré, one of
[what I called] Hitler’s gifts to this country. He had to leave because Hitler
had taken over in Germany. The other one was Hermann Ferdinand Fränkel.
He was in Classics and he taught a wonderful course, several wonderful
courses, in classical philosophy too. Winters not only taught well. He saw to
it that we took the best teachers in other departments. That was very
important to me in those days.
Humburg: What was the student body like at the time?
Trimpi: [00:07:06] It was mostly girls for two years. Let’s see how many years. When
did the war end? 1945, the war ended. The boys came back and boy was that
fun. We lived it up. I didn’t live in a dorm until my junior year. I lived at
home. Then I got a small scholarship. It’s the only scholarship I got at
Stanford. It was enough money to move into a dorm for one quarter. I
moved into Manzanita, one of the houses--a real house, not a big dormitory.
I never lived in the dormitories. I lived in this house. It was wonderful. There
were about thirty of us. We had a wonderful time. Then the boys came back
and we had an even better time. [laughter]
Humburg: Tell me a little bit about that. What was it like?
Trimpi: [00:07:52] It just was fun. It was great. Before that, the only boys we knew
were 4-Fs. They weren’t [our] favorites. No, it’s just that I met several
lifelong friends when the boys came back. One was a guy named Tom Hanzo
[Thomas A. Hanzo], who had been a navigator on a bomber and a prisoner.

17

He’d been in a German prison camp. The most interesting one I met was a
man named William Rehnquist, Bill Rehnquist. He didn’t have a car but we
walked around the campus, having a lot of conversations because he loved to
argue and I loved to argue. He, as you may guess, was a strong conservative,
a Republican. I was a wild-eyed liberal. We had a lot of fun.
I think he decided I was not of his political persuasion [laughter] and
the next time I heard of him, of course, is when his picture was on the cover
of Time magazine for being on the Supreme Court. I had some good friends
on the Daily [Stanford Daily]. The Daily was very important to my life.
Humburg: That’s what I was going to ask you about.
Trimpi: [00:09:03] I had good, good friends. I can’t remember all their names. Even
though I was in English literature, I stayed with the Daily till I-Humburg: You wrote articles for the Daily for a few years?
Trimpi: [00:09:12] I had a column all my own.
Humburg: Do you remember what it was about?
Trimpi: [00:09:15] No, I don’t remember except it was kind of a gossip column.
[laughter] Might have been serious, I don’t remember. My best friends were
on the Daily. They’re the ones I liked and enjoyed being with. They all went
into journalism after college.
Humburg: You graduated in 1948?
Trimpi: [00:09:36] Yes. [sentences deleted] By that time, I had met my future
husband. He came in 1946.
Humburg: You met...?
Trimpi: [00:10:11] We met in a class, a poetry class, of Winters’. That was it.

18

Humburg: That was it, huh?
Trimpi: [00:10:18] He wanted to be a poet too. He was an Easterner, very different
from me, very different background. He had gone to one of the best prep
schools in the country, Phillips Exeter, and was very well prepared for
Stanford. He had met a man who told him about Stanford and about
Winters. He applied to Stanford instead of to Harvard--which all the other
boys did--because he wanted to work with Winters. He wanted to be a poet.
That was it. He came and we met in Winters’ class and we started going
together right away.
Humburg: What was the English Department like as a student at that time because I
know you then worked in the department right after you graduated?
Trimpi:

[00:11:01] I did. I worked for a year as an assistant secretary. I didn’t make a
lot of friends in the English Department. I made them mostly through my
dormitory and through just meeting people generally. It was very fluid. There
was no specific group that you felt you had to belong to or anything like that.
I never encountered that.

Humburg: You took many courses in the English Department?
Trimpi: [00:11:28] Yes. I shouldn’t just talk about Winters and Cunningham. The
people who taught Old English and things like that. There was one guy,
Herbert Meritt [Herbert Dean Meritt]. He was very well known. He was a
great philologist because he had done a dictionary of all the words he had
discovered in a Beowulf manuscript or something like that. He was a real
expert. He was also the funniest man in the university. He could tell stories
that just had you rolling. He was [also] chairman of the department.

19

After I graduated, I applied [to be] an assistant secretary in the
department and he was the chairman. He interviewed me for the job and
found out that I didn’t know how to write shorthand. I knew how to type. In
those days, a secretary had to have shorthand. He said, “Oh well.” I had told
him I can write quickly so he gave me the job. [laughter] He was good. There
were some other very fine teachers. Virgil Whitaker [Virgil Keeble Whitaker]
was the chairman later on, he was a wonderful teacher of Shakespeare and
Spenser.
Now the thing is that Winters and Cunningham and Virgil Whitaker
and one other man in the department, were all students of the former
chairman of the [English] department named Briggs--William Dinsmore
Briggs. He was a source of wonderful ideas of teaching English in the sense
of knowing the history of it and the philosophy of the period behind the
literature he was teaching. He made that department. Winters wrote a poem
about him when he died. There was a library in the department called the
Briggs Collection. He had a big influence. I never met him. I think he died
the year I came to Stanford. Those were the influential people.
When I was a graduate, I took Old English and that was great fun
because Herb Meritt taught it. Oh god, that was good.
Humburg: Tell me a little bit about your path into your master’s in poetry.
Trimpi: [00:13:38] That’s the other important person, Wallace Stegner. He founded
the Creative Writing Program. Winters was already there and they knew he
would teach poetry. Stegner was a very well-known novelist. He had won the
Pulitzer Prize with his first book and he was asked to come and start the

20

Creative Writing Program based on the money that the department received
from Dr. E. H. Jones. His brother, Richard Foster Jones, was the chairman
of the English Department. Dr. E. H. Jones was a Texas millionaire and he
donated enough money to start the Creative Writing Program and finance
the scholarships and fellowships. That’s what made it. They gave fellowships
in poetry and in fiction [Stegner Fellows] every year thereafter. They’re still
doing it.
Humburg: Do you remember what year that was that they actually founded the Creative
Writing Program?
Trimpi: [00:14:34] About 1946 or 1947, not far from there. It started while I was
there, and Winters was in charge of the poetry fellowships. He gave me one.
The year I had it was 1949-1950 I think.
Humburg: So then you were a part of the Creative Writing Program as a poet?
Trimpi: [00:15:01] Yes, and my MA thesis was a group of about thirty poems.
Humburg: What was that like to be in the Creative Writing Program?
Trimpi: [00:15:10] It was wonderful. I loved it.
Humburg: What were the courses like?
Trimpi: [00:15:14] I took more courses from Winters and I took a couple courses
from Stegner too. They were very good.
Humburg: Did you do any of what they called the “Workshopping Process” because I
know you were writing as part of your courses?
Trimpi: [00:15:30] When I started teaching, I taught the workshop The Writing of
Poetry. When Kenneth Fields was in charge of the Creative Writing Program,

21

he offered me one of the teaching fellowships to teach the course, The
Writing of Poetry, he called it. I had a lot of fun doing that.
Humburg: Do you have any special remembrances of those courses or moments that
were really significant to you in your own writing?
Trimpi: [00:16:05] What it did is it forced me to clarify my own thought about how
you go about writing a poem. When Winters taught, he usually taught the
history of style but I wasn’t good at that. When I taught it, I categorized most
of the English poetry into different forms and I had the students read great
examples of a form, for instance, a love poem. I had them read a whole lot of
good love poems and good letter poems and dramatic monologues and then
write that kind of poem. It stimulated them into, I think, writing better than
they might have otherwise.
Humburg: Was this English 250?
Trimpi: [00:16:47] Yes, 250.
Humburg: I remember reading about that.
Trimpi: [00:16:52] Yes, that was a wonderful thing. I was very happy with what I got.
They wrote really well. They could just write about what happened that
morning or something like that, but if they wanted to write a love poem,
usually they could write it because they’ve been thinking about love.
Humburg: Was it just the love poem, in particular, that was easier to write?
Trimpi: [00:17:13] I think it was, or they had to write a poem on nature and they
would describe a scene. Or, best of all, a letter poem. A letter poem brings
out an awful lot in a person because they’re writing to a specific person and
there they’ve got some subject matter.

22

Humburg: When you were a master’s student, what was the composition of your class?
Now there were more men on campus, in general. Do you remember what
was the balance of men to women when you were a graduate student?
Trimpi: [00:17:40] I don’t think I even took notice. It was usually enough. Because it
was English, I think it might have leaned toward women because more
women were majoring in English and the occasional man would come along
and be very good.
Humburg: What about the teachers, the professors?
Trimpi: [00:17:58] In the writing program?
Humburg: Yes.
Trimpi: [00:17:59] I can’t tell you really how they taught, particularly the fiction
instructors. Several of them became very good friends. I mean, some really
good novelists came because they wanted the fellowship. They could live on
the fellowship for a whole year--if you didn’t spend a lot of money you
could. Some of my best friends came, particularly in poetry, as fellows, for
example, Edgar Bowers.
Humburg: He was in the same program with you at the time?
Trimpi: [00:18:29] He was a year before or after. I can’t answer that but it was very
close to when I held the fellowship. He came and Charles Gullans [Charles
Bennett Gullans] came and Thom Gunn [Thomas William Gunn] came
much later. He’s the most famous of them. Who was the other one?
Humburg: Are these the ones that were called the “Stanford Group of Poets”?

23

Trimpi: [00:18:54] Right. They all either knew about Winters or they came and then
they liked him and they learned a great deal from him. They’re called the
“Winters’ Circle.”
Humburg: Just for a little bit here, before you actually came back to teach at Stanford,
you went to Harvard for your PhD?
Trimpi: [00:19:16] I’m trying to get it straight in my mind. I got the MA and Wes
came in 1946. He graduated in 1950, I think. Then the following year, while
he was still an undergraduate, I worked in the department. Then we were
married in 1950. That date I have right. First we went to Europe together, he
and I. We traveled to Europe together because we both wanted to go. His
father paid for my trip. I’ve never forgotten how good he was. Wes’
graduation present was a trip to Europe. We went East and visited his family
in New York and then we got on the Queen Elizabeth--I still remember that-and we went to England. We spent nine months in Europe.
Humburg: Were you writing poetry through all of this or gathering experiences for it in
the future?
Trimpi: [00:20:13] Sure we were. That’s what you do. You go and look at the
pictures. That’s what we did. He loved painting and I loved painting too.
That’s what we did. We met Donald Davie, a very famous English poet. He
had corresponded with Winters and Winters gave us a letter to Davie, and we
went and visited Davie in England. He and his wife were very kind to us.
Later on, Donald Davie came to the poetry program at Stanford and so we
could return his and his wife’s hospitality. We traveled around. We had three

24

months in England, three months in France, and three months in Italy. Then
we came home and then he went off to Harvard to get his PhD.
Humburg: And you did too, didn’t you?
Trimpi: [00:21:02] I went with him.
Humburg: Did you have specific aspirations for getting a PhD at the time?
Trimpi:

[00:21:11] I sure did. Again, his father came through. I know how it
happened. It was the Korean War and Wes was drafted so he wasn’t going to
go to grad school. Then he went down for his second physical exam in
Boston and they turned him down. By that time, he had a bad back. He had
what was called “the professor’s bad back” which comes from sitting too
long at a desk. I was all set to go to work or something, and instead his father
said, “Well, if Wes is going to graduate school, you can go too.” I went off to
grad school and entered the Harvard program.

Humburg: The Harvard program in--?
Trimpi: [00:22:01] English literature.
Humburg: English literature and poetry, wasn’t it also?
Trimpi: [00:22:05] No, it was a regular PhD. My dissertation topic was Melville and I
wrote this book. I wrote a book on Melville’s confidence man and the
American politics in the 1850s. That was my dissertation turned into a book.
That’s what you did in those days. You couldn’t write a whole book while
you’re a grad student but you spend the next years turning it into a book.
Humburg:

When was the book published? You got your PhD in 1957?

Trimpi: [00:22:38] No, I took a long time because we moved back to Stanford. Wes
got his right away, no trouble. I waited. And we came back to Stanford, so I

25

didn’t get mine till 1966. I worked at home on it. In those days, there was no
limit on when you got your PhD. Now you can’t do that. You have to get it
within four or five years or you don’t get it. Again, I profited from when I was
in school.
Humburg: You came back to Stanford in 1962?
Trimpi: [00:23:16] 1957.
Humburg: What were the circumstances of your coming back?
Trimpi: [00:23:24] There was a job offer at Stanford in 1957 and it was a very lean
year for jobs. Winters wanted Wes back at Stanford, his teachers wanted him
back at Stanford, and he loved it. He had three other offers. He had one at
Yale and we turned that down because we weren’t sure of tenure but
Stanford’s offer included tenure.
Humburg: Included tenure. Okay.
Trimpi: [00:23:53] Yes, included tenure.
Humburg: When he arrived, what was his position?
Trimpi: [00:23:57] Assistant professor.
Humburg: Was that in English or Creative Writing?
Trimpi: [00:24:02] English. He was a scholar. He also wrote poems and studied with
Winters. He had all his life wanted to be both a poet and a scholar. So he did.
He was a great scholar.
Humburg: His specialty was?
Trimpi: [00:24:18] He started out just in the Renaissance. He ended up including
classical literature. His book is a history of criticism from the time of Plato
and people like that. It’s a wonderful book but very difficult to understand.

26

Wes had the kind of mind that could handle extreme abstractions. It’s not
something you read in five minutes. I read every word of it because I helped
edit it.
Humburg: I was just going to ask if you helped with it?
Trimpi: [00:24:53] Sure. I helped edit it, along with the people that published it.
Princeton published it.
Humburg: The two of you arrived back on campus in 1957 and your husband, Wesley
Trimpi, is an assistant professor, right?
Trimpi: [00:25:10] Assistant professor in English, yes.
Humburg: With a promise for tenure.
Trimpi: [00:25:13] Yes, which he received regularly but he also published a whole lot
of articles.
His graduate students--they’re still fond of them. One of his graduate
students, who also wrote poems for my classes but did his scholarship under
Wes, is coming on Sunday to visit me with his wife. I’m so pleased. He’s
going through California. He’s done a lot of things. Steve Shankman [Steven
Shankman] is his name. He’s written four or five books and he was head of
one of the branches of UNESCO. He is gifted in languages and that is a
great gift. He can learn any language, including Chinese and Russian and
languages like that.
Humburg: When you came back to Stanford in 1957, did you have any aspirations
yourself of teaching or joining the faculty?

27

Trimpi: [00:26:04] At that moment, I was quite happy raising my two girls. It’s only
later that I did, because I like to do research and things like that. I always had
some project or some article I was writing.
Humburg: I think you said at the time you were still working on your book there, right?
Trimpi: [00:26:20] That’s right. That took a lot of time. But it was fun studying
American politics in the 1850s. It’s more fun than it is now.
Humburg:

What was fun about it?

Trimpi: [00:26:34] One of the fun things is that cartooning began in that era and
there were political cartoons that show all the different politicians caricatured
in a certain way. Like one of them might have some mannerism or wearing
his pants and his boots a certain way and they would caricature him. They
were just as hard on their politicians then as they are now. That was when
caricature began and I got really interested in caricature. There’s one of them
right there on my book jacket. There’s Lincoln and there’s Seward and this
is--I forget his name.
Humburg: Can you turn that just a little bit so that we can see?
Trimpi: [00:27:11] They had a lot of fun with Lincoln.
Humburg: Oh I see.
Trimpi: [00:27:15] You see. That’s where cartoons began.
Humburg: What was the departmental culture like when you arrived back on campus?
Trimpi: [00:27:29] It was very welcoming. One of the things we did that I think they
don’t do anymore, whenever a new teacher came, on any level, usually the
lowest level, if you were in the department, you would invite him [and his
family] to your house for dinner and you got to know them. You would have

28

good conversation and find out what his interests were and what his wife’s
interests were and how many kids they had. I got in the habit of inviting the
new people and other members of the department to come to dine. It was
very warm. You might think from the point of view now it was rather fancy
because you’d serve them a real good dinner on your best china, which I had
inherited from my mother-in-law. It was kind of fun to do that.
Then thereafter, they would invite you back and you’d start a
friendship that way. Sometimes you became really close friends like we did
with some and less so with others. Everybody knew everybody and their
family, not just the teacher.
Humburg: What was it like as a faculty wife at that time?
Trimpi: [00:28:37] I thought it was a fun thing to do. Very little responsibility. If
you’d like to have people for dinner and talk about your kids, that’s what we
would do. If you really took to each other, then you’d see them. The wife
would visit and see the family and the husbands would get together. A good
friend that my husband made and kept, and we are still friends, was the man
who taught Anglo-Saxon literature.
Humburg: Remember his name?
Trimpi: [00:29:13] Fred Robinson and his wife, Helen. We became very good friends.
Fred was Wes’s office mate and you either make an enemy for life or you
make a great friend for life. He and Fred were office mates. We saw them
very often and they’re still friends. They live in New Haven. He turned down
Harvard and went to Yale. He left Stanford.
Humburg: So very long-lasting friendships?

29

Trimpi: [00:29:41] Yes. They were very good friends. There were others. I don’t
remember all of them.
Humburg: I think you also were very close with the Winters, weren’t you?
Trimpi: [00:29:51] Oh yes, as long as he lived. We would go out there. He didn’t like
to entertain formally, Winters, never a dinner. You were invited out to chat
because he was a very informal man. His wife was simply wonderful. Her
name was Janet Lewis. She was a very fine novelist. She also had more
friends than any woman I’ve ever known. She was warm toward everybody.
He would sit in his chair and growl, and she would offer tea and things like
that. [laughter] That was fun. They lived in the same house for all the years in
Los Altos. It’s not there anymore. It’s been knocked down.
Humburg: Do you have any other special remembrances of relationships or events that
might have happened while you were there?
Trimpi: [00:30:49] I don’t know what you mean by relationships.
Humburg: Just the memories or a special story that you [may] recall.
Trimpi: [00:30:57] There are probably a lot of them but I’m not sure I can remember.
Never been good at telling stories.
Humburg: Maybe if we talk a little bit about your teaching, some things will come back.
You taught a number of courses for several years at Stanford. You
mentioned a little bit about teaching English 250.
Trimpi: [00:31:16] Yes, that was special. I got asked to do that. After Winters died,
they needed someone to teach it. I was a lecturer at Stanford and I could
teach anything I wanted, so I taught English poetry. Once I threw in the
novels and that was different from the 250. That was a course already created

30

by Winters. I was a lecturer for seventeen years. I got asked either to teach
humanities and I could teach going back to Homer and Virgil--I did that in
translation, or I could teach English and then I would teach poetry. I did
occasionally teach the novel.
Humburg: Were you allowed to pretty much choose within a topic category what you
wanted to teach?
Trimpi: [00:32:13] They would say in general what I should teach and I could pick
out my own writers and so on. I liked that because it didn’t take a lot of time.
I was able to keep house and look after my growing girls and still teach one
day a week.
Humburg: What were the circumstances that you were offered to be a lecturer? How did
that happen?
Trimpi: [00:32:32] I guess because I was around. By that time, I think I had my PhD
from Harvard and that looked good to them. They thought I could teach.
Humburg: But you had some experience teaching at Harvard, didn’t you? Didn’t you do
some TA’ing at Harvard?
Trimpi: [00:32:47] Oh yes, everybody there had to be a teaching fellow. That, again,
was a very good experience. That was in Radcliffe because--I think Radcliffe
hadn’t yet become part of Harvard. It was on the turning point from one to
the other. I did teach just girls. I walked over to Radcliffe and taught there. It
was called “tutorial.”
We had individual students and we got them through their senior
theses. We would deal with them individually and I got all of my students
lined up on Friday, so that I could leave my baby home with my husband and

31

go down on Fridays. He didn’t mind doing that one day a week. That wasn’t
a problem. We couldn’t afford a babysitter anyway. I wouldn’t have trusted
my baby with a babysitter.
Humburg: Did your husband pretty much help you out at times like that where you
shared the caring of the kids?
Trimpi: [00:33:45] He definitely did. He complained about the diapers but I showed
him how to do it, so he did it.
Humburg: Gave you a little bit more freedom in your career.
Trimpi: [00:33:55] Well, it did. It gave me one day a week and because it was tutorial,
I got all of them on one day.
Humburg: Of all the classes that you taught, did you develop some techniques that you
felt were specifically your own and successful?
Trimpi: [00:34:07] I don’t know whether they were my own or not. I just taught what
I knew. It was all very ad hoc as they say. I certainly never took a class in
education. I cared so deeply about literature and about poetry, and novels
too, that it was just not a problem. I made a series of lectures. I must admit I
read my lectures. I wasn’t good at standing up, you know, and telling jokes. I
wasn’t good at that. I would read my lectures and they would listen.
Humburg: You wrote out most of what you wanted to say?
Trimpi: [00:34:40] Yes. I still have them. I don’t know what to do with them. Maybe I
should give them to the archives. [laughter] No, I won’t do that.
Humburg: That’s a thought.
Trimpi: [00:34:48] I’m going to hire someone to come and help me go through them,
throw them out.

32

Humburg: Was there anyone who was influential for you in how you taught or how you
chose to frame a topic that you wanted to teach?
Trimpi: [00:34:59] No.
Humburg: You just kind of did it out of your own--?
Trimpi: [00:35:02] I did it out of my own head, yes. I probably wouldn’t have been
happy doing the way other people do it.
Humburg: What was it like to be a lecturer at the time you were doing it?
Trimpi: [00:35:14] I liked it because I still had a lot of energy in those days. I would
just take the subject and write what I thought about it or use good criticisms.
One of my favorite courses was a course in criticism because there was a
wonderful textbook, edited I believe by Jackson Bate [Walter Jackson Bate],
who was a famous professor at Harvard. I just loved teaching the history of
criticism because I was really helping students to look more carefully at
literature through this way. I was also defining literature, defining what a
poem was, what a novel was, what a play was, what an essay was, and so on. I
really liked doing that. It was partly because it was such an excellent text to
have the students buy. I think that might have been Bates’ anthology too. He
was a very good teacher.
Humburg: For seventeen years you said you were part of the lecturing faculty at
Stanford.
Trimpi: [00:36:15] Yes. Each year they would hire me and they only paid a pittance. I
liked the teaching. I didn’t care about the money. We had enough to live on.
Humburg: I remember reading a comment that you wrote in one of the articles, I guess
after you were an assistant professor at University of Michigan for a term.

33

Trimpi: [00:36:38] That was completely different. I got that job through a friend I
had known at Stanford, who had been at Stanford for years. His name will
come to me in a moment. At that point in time, Michigan and all the
universities were looking for women because there was the feminist
movement. I had just published Melville’s Confidence Men and American Politics in
the 1850s. My friend presented me to the department and they hired me. I’d
never been to Michigan. I’d never even thought about Michigan, and there I
was in East Lansing.
Humburg: This was like 1980s?
Trimpi: [00:37:16] I believe you’re right. It would be the 1980s. But before that, I had
gone to Canada. I had another friend, a good friend, an American-born
Canadian--Christopher Drummond--who taught at the University of Alberta
for many years. He had discovered Winters’ criticism. He never met him. He
so admired Winters that he would send his Canadian students to Stanford to
get their advanced degrees or to study with Winters. When he came down to
Stanford he gave a series of lectures.
Humburg: How would you compare teaching at Stanford to the other universities that
you taught at, especially in terms of the faculty environment?
Trimpi: [00:38:23] I was a guest and guests are always treated beautifully. In Canada, I
was treated very courteously, and I became a lifelong friend of the people I
met there. And I had a good time teaching Melville. My book, Melville’s
Confidence Men and American Politics in the 1850s, was out and I looked good. I
had fun. I was in deep snow for three months.
[break]

34

Humburg: We were talking about the various universities that you had taught at.
Trimpi: [00:39:06] I was going to tell you about Michigan State. I learned a great deal
because it’s completely different. It isn’t a private university. Well, neither
was Alberta. It was very large and [had] a very big English Department. But
never having been on the faculty at Stanford--I was just a lecturer--I’d never
been to a department meeting. My husband had always told me about
department meetings and how acrimonious they could be. I did go to a
department meeting at Michigan and it was very interesting. Just the number
of disputes there were and so on and so forth.
I also enjoyed very much teaching there. I had some good students
and I taught Melville. I was only there for one winter semester or quarter. I
enjoyed it but I didn’t apply anywhere. I was just as happy to stay at home.
By then I may have started my Civil War interest, I’m not sure.
Humburg: Did you ever have any aspirations of getting on the tenure track and
becoming a professor?
Trimpi: [00:40:19] I never had to. I know many women have to. They’re either single
or they need to teach. I was just as happy to work on my own projects. I
never applied for anything and was turned down. I enjoyed the teaching at
Stanford and I enjoyed it at the two other places. I enjoyed the students,
talking to them and teaching something I know something about. If you
mean as a woman having any problems, no, I never did. I never did as an
undergraduate either. I would do what I thought was right to do in the
classes and say what I thought was right and never was treated any
differently.

35

Humburg: You didn’t feel, even as a female and a lecturer versus being on the tenure
track, that you were treated any differently or had any different
opportunities?
Trimpi: [00:41:10] No, I never did. Actually I never had to go to a department
meeting so I never got involved in any causes. Also I had had the experience
as an undergraduate of an extremely good female professor at Stanford and
that was Margery Bailey. I wanted to mention her. Besides Winters, Margery
Bailey was the teacher in the department at that time.
Humburg: What was she like?
Trimpi: [00:41:36] She was marvelous. She was half an actress. She is the woman who
helped to found the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. She taught wonderful
subjects. She taught Dickens and was famous for that. She taught
Restoration comedy and [was] famous for that. What did I take from her?
The best course I took from her--18th Century Literature--didn’t involve her
being an actress. She knew everything about eighteenth century literature.
She and Winters were my two great teachers at Stanford. I had the
impression over the years she was not treated well by the department because
she did not become a full professor until the year she retired. That was
regarded, and I think it was probably, a great injustice. In those days, to get
ahead in a department, you published. Margery Bailey had only published one
thing in her career and that was her dissertation, which was an edition of one
of James Boswell’s works. She published that with a very good press and she
got her job on that. Thereafter, she wanted to teach and she was superb at it.
In scenes in Shakespeare, she would play a role or something like that. Also

36

she was very, very strong on Sam Johnson. I read Sam Johnson and he’s
somebody you read until the end of your life--he’s so great.
She was the only one I ever heard there was any discussion about.
She apparently was not treated very well in department meetings. She also
had an extremely abrupt personality. Anyone would have had to be careful
what they said to Marge Bailey because she was very forthright in what she
said. Some of the men didn’t care for her. That’s why she wasn’t advanced, I
think, and also [that she was] not publishing enough.
Humburg: While you were on teaching, tell me a little bit about your students that took
your classes. Were they mostly undergrad or were they graduate or pretty well
mixed?
Trimpi: [00:43:39] It depended on the course. My course in Michigan on Melville was
all graduate students. At Stanford, of course, it was usually just freshmen in
the English Department that took the courses.
Humburg: What was the student body like over the course of the time that you were
teaching because you were there in the 1960s and 1970s when there was a lot
happening among the student body?
Trimpi: [00:44:06] I remember. I was quite cross about it. I remember in the 1960s
when the students invaded the president’s office and I believe they set fire to
it or dumped water on it? They did something I thought was unforgivable.
Also in the president’s office was a grad student’s dissertation and they
ruined his dissertation. He lost all his work on it. I thought, you don’t do
that. If you have something to say, you don’t vandalize to make your point. I

37

was very disappointed with it. I really was. I was glad when they stopped
doing that.
Humburg: Did you find any of that attitude or unrest or behavior percolate through
your classes at all or did you not see much change, at least in your own
teaching situation?
Trimpi: [00:44:55] I don’t remember fighting it in my own classroom. It was mostly
attacks, verbal and otherwise, on people up in administration. They really
were pretty darn hard. Who was president then? Who was the guy whose
office-Humburg: Lyman?
Trimpi: [00:45:11] Was it Lyman?
Humburg: Richard Lyman.
Trimpi: [00:45:12] Lyman. Oh, I remember at the end of it all, or through it, I
admired how Lyman had handled it. I don’t remember details. I can’t tell you
why I formed that opinion but I thought he had done a good job. He hadn’t
given in. He hadn’t given in but he had taken into consideration some of the
things the students wanted and they were gradually implemented. Black
studies was implemented and women’s studies became subjects, and so on.
He made the transition possible. That’s my memory of it. I hope I’m right.
Humburg: The whole time that you were teaching, did you have any significant
collaborations with other members who were teaching or were on the
faculty?

38

Trimpi: [00:46:00] If I did, I’ve forgotten. I usually just taught my course and that was
it. I might have. I can’t tell you. I don’t remember for sure. I certainly got on
with all the other teachers on my level.
Humburg: Do you have any remembrance of how you happened to get into your
research on the Civil War?
Trimpi: [00:46:32] I do. I’ve got so many there though. Partly because Melville’s
Confidence Men and American Politics in the 1850s had gotten me interested in
American politics. I started thinking about the war and how it led up to it
and its consequences and about the war in general because it was such a
major event in our history. Then I got interested in the post-war period
because I discovered that there was a certain atmosphere after the war of
reconciliation that I think has been lost in the teaching of the nineteenth
century in American history. They’ve forgotten how the soldiers got together
after the war and shook hands. I just found that so moving. I got into that
just as a period of history. That’s what got me into the confederates because
since then, that feeling of deep reconciliation is gone. It’s a historical period
and it was meaningful because the country could have completely fallen
apart. But the North became sympathetic to the South, at least the soldiers
did.
The South did its best to recover. Something appealed to me. Also
it’s sentimental that I used to look at the pictures at Harvard in their hallways
of the soldiers, the Union soldiers. It was an emotional attraction because
that was such a terrible war--fought for a good reason--but it could have

39

been avoided. That’s what I write about--that some of the politicians were
only thinking of themselves and not of the country. Could’ve been avoided.
Humburg: What time was your book published?
Trimpi: [00:48:24] I don’t know. Let’s look and see. 1987.
Humburg: 1987. What about The Crimson Confederates?
Trimpi: [00:48:40] That’s quite a bit later I think. Yes, this took a long time to write
but I had fun writing it.
Humburg: You’ve still got some notes in there. [laughter]
Trimpi: [00:48:51] Oh, I just counted them. Come on, where’s the date? They don’t
have it on the right page.
Humburg: That’s all right. We can look it up later. This was the second book?
Trimpi: [00:49:06] Definitely, a lot later. If you want to, look in the preface. I tell all
the steps by which I got interested. A lot of good people were involved.
Humburg: It was your own curiosity.
Trimpi: [00:49:19] You bet it was. I’ve never, never taught this material and I wrote
this book for fun.
Humburg: If you had your academic career to do over again, is there anything that you
would do differently, as you look back?
Trimpi: [00:50:00] I’ve never had the thought that I would do it differently. So many
fortunate things happened to me. Somehow I happened upon people, first of
all, starting way back in high school, way back in the third grade, teachers
who were willing to help me. Right back in the third grade, Miss Welcome.
In high school, Ray Cowell helped me. And then at Stanford, Winters helped

40

me. At Harvard, I was already pretty much on my own. And Wes’s career--he
had good luck with his teachers too. They were very helpful to him.
Humburg: You feel there were key people that really helped inspire you?
Trimpi: [00:50:43] I think so. Nobody ever deterred me. I did pretty much what I
wanted to do. Partly that was Wes. He never objected to my teaching. He
thought it was good because he knew I was happy doing it. He was even
happy staying home on Fridays.
Humburg: [laughter] Taking care of your daughters.
Trimpi: [00:51:04] Yes. Incidentally, I meant to tell you, my daughter went to
Stanford. My oldest daughter, Erica Trimpi, went to Stanford. She’s the class
of 1976.
Humburg: Did she study English too?
Trimpi: [00:51:19] No, she studied art history. She lucked out at Stanford. She hadn’t
quite decided her major and then she finally did. The year she graduated, her
last year, there were three magnificent art historians visiting Stanford. That’s
what changed her life. One of them was from Michigan. I don’t remember
the others. They got her into art history. The one who was visiting from
Michigan said, “You ought to go and get your PhD.” She thought that was
[great]--my husband [and I] thought that was great. She went back and
graduated from Michigan--got a PhD from him. Can’t remember his name.
Terrific teacher.
She published an article as soon as she finished her degree in one of
the great art history magazines. I forget which one, maybe two articles. Then
she got a job offer. They were living in Oakland. She got a job offer at Santa

41

Clara University, but the amount of money she would have been paid
because, you know, you get very little money for your first job, would not
even pay for babysitters. She stayed home. Then she didn’t work anymore.
She raised her two boys. She was happy. That was her choice.
Humburg: Talking about your daughter, is there any advice that you would give young
women today starting out in an academic career such as what you had?
Trimpi: [00:52:53] Go to a university. Don’t go to a single sex women’s school. Our
other daughter went to Smith and I don’t think she got a very good
education there at all. We sent her there because my husband’s cousin, Bucky
Harward [Vernon J. Harward], was a professor there and he said it was a
really good place. It had changed and changed extremely and yet she went
there. I don’t think-Humburg: What do you think it is about a university versus-Trimpi: [00:53:23] Because the only thing they were interested in teaching her was
women’s studies. She did not get good guidance in her career. I think if
you’re a teacher, you should carefully look at your students and give them the
best advice you have. They were forcing the dogmas of feminism on people
who were not interested in it. She also did not want to become a physician or
something that required a long schooling. We wanted her to get a good
education, a good general education. Smith had that. Smith had that but it
was under a process of change. She also was very unhappy there. She quit her
junior year. They didn’t want her to.
She came and lived at home for a year. She was very unhappy there. I
don’t quite know yet why. She did go back and she finished up and got her

42

degree but she could never settle on any single subject to major in. One of
the main things a teacher does with the students: find out what they’re really
interested in and guide them into that.
Humburg: You felt you had that from many of your mentors?
Trimpi: [00:54:30] Yes, and my other daughter did too. She got splendid advice.
Humburg: You’re still writing today, aren’t you?
Trimpi: [00:54:41] I am but I may have written my last poem. I’m working on it. I
should tell you, I have a book coming out. It’s promised to me by July, a
collection of my poems. All of them.
Humburg: What inspires you to write today?
Trimpi: [00:54:56] I have something to say about some subject of interest.
Humburg: Usually where does that come from?
Trimpi: [00:55:03] Out of my thinking or my reading. Also I love writing poems on
works of art. The last one I published, except for the one I’m still working
on, was on a Triptych of the Madonna and Child and two saints. I got an
idea about it and then I did some research to find out certain things, and then
I wrote it. It was just published in a magazine called First Things in 2014. I
thought that was the last one I would write, but I guess it isn’t.
Humburg: You’re never quite sure of that, which is a good thing.
Trimpi: [00:55:40] No. I got so interested in writing poems on works of art, I
published a collection of them.
Humburg: To what extent do you think women in your field, in creative writing and
poetry, have shaped the discipline and the art today?

43

Trimpi: [00:55:58] Certainly some of the great poets are women. It was just starting
with Emily Dickinson and also my teachers at Stanford--both Cunningham
and Winters--admired immensely certain women poets, not just Dickinson. J.
V. Cunningham thought Louise Bogan, a poet of the 1930s, was probably the
best poet writing. He taught her and showed us what was good about her.
Winters also admired Bogan. Cunningham wrote a book on Emily
Dickinson. I never felt any discrimination that way. In fact, sometimes the
women just wrote better than the men. That was a fact. Of course, they write
great novels.
Winters taught Edith Wharton. I still read Edith Wharton and Henry
James. I never felt that the teachers I had discriminated, if that’s what you’re
asking. I never felt that they did, the ones I admired. Maybe some others did.
They never spoke anything evil about any other teacher, any woman teacher,
particularly. Just Marge Bailey was kind of a problem.
Humburg: She’s the one you talked about?
Trimpi: [00:57:18] Yes. But they both knew she was a good teacher. Not all the
department knew that.
Humburg: I have just some general questions about insights as a published poet and as a
teacher. Do you have any advice for those coming behind you, the successes
you’ve had, what you’ve learned?
Trimpi: [00:57:43] I guess I would start being a teacher immediately and tell them
about the forms of poetry and to practice those and see what they can do
with them.
Humburg: That sounds like the English 250 structure that you put in place?

44

Trimpi: [00:57:55] Yes, that’s what I would say. Do it this way and you’ll get good
rewards from your students. Also I’m a believer in form. If I had anyone to
discuss poetry with, I would say, learn the forms, learn the meters, and write
in meter. Don’t write in free verse because there’s no structure there. There’s
no structure for your mind or for your writing. It’s just wandering up and
down the page.
I made a very good friend late in life. I’ve never seen him. He wrote
me out of the blue and interviewed me. He since has gone on to write a
magnificent [book] of what poetry is and what criticism is and what its
history is. If I had a student today, I’d put them onto reading that book and
also to look back at Winters’ criticism. His name is James Matthew Wilson
and he teaches at Villanova. He’s got his own website and he just turns out
essays galore. He’s published all over and has two books coming out. He is
not a Stanford person or a Harvard person at all. I would put his work in the
hands of any young English student, writer or scholar. I would do that.
Humburg: Because?
Trimpi: [00:59:15] I’m so fortunate that he contacted me. He was interested in my
poetry.
Humburg: How did he find you? Do you know?
Trimpi: [00:59:22] Through my poetry. Then he called me out of the blue. He got my
phone number somehow. I thought, “Ugh, who’s this weirdo?” He turns out
to be a wonderful man. He’s the one that did the interview and published it
in Think magazine. James Matthew Wilson. I can’t speak too highly of him.

45

Humburg:

Before I actually ask you to read one of your poems, do you have a favorite
poem that you’ve written?

Trimpi: [00:59:49] I picked out one of my favorites, Autumn Drought, because it’s
about Stanford. It’s about my teaching there and I thought that was
appropriate.
Humburg: Is there anything that I haven’t asked you that you’d like to share with us?
Trimpi: [01:00:13] There were a couple things. Mostly it was friends I wanted to
mention. I mentioned the Robinsons and who else? I mentioned Steve
Shankman who was Wes’s student but also he wanted to write poems. He
wrote some good poems on Rembrandt. There are so many [friends]. It’s
very hard to remember all of them.
Humburg: It sounded like you had very fond memories of being a faculty wife and being
a teacher all at the same time.
Trimpi: [01:00:47] I do. That was wonderful. That was our social life.
Humburg: What was the feeling of being a family on campus for you?
Trimpi: [01:00:59] There was one friend who had a rather amazing history at Stanford
you wouldn’t expect. That was Bruce Franklin. You know who he was?
Humburg: I do.
Trimpi: [01:01:12] He was the--he wasn’t just a--communist. He was a Maoist, is what
he was. We were very good friends and our kids played together. Jane was so
nice but she’s political too. We knew them extremely well. He taught
Melville. That was our bond. He taught Melville and wrote a book on
Melville. Then he got into the political thing. I remember we met them in
Europe. We were traveling there and they were traveling. They had been to

46

Paris during one of those periods when Paris was all pummeled and they
said, “We’ve converted to Maoism.” I thought, gee whiz, what does that
mean?
Later on when the Cuban Missile Crisis came up and we were having
dinner and I asked Bruce directly. I said, “You don’t really think that the
communists in Cuba should be allowed to have missiles?” He said, “Yes, I
do.” I went home after that and then I said to Wes, “You know, I don’t think
I want to see the Franklins anymore.” He really means what he says. I
thought he was just a fellow traveler but a man like that can be dangerous to
the country. I’m not into that at all. That was one friendship that ended. It
ended on a political issue, the only one that ever did.
Then Franklin, of course, he’s the only professor that was ever asked
to leave the university. I thought that was the way to handle it. He wasn’t
going to change his mind. He’s still publishing and writing too.
Humburg: Where is he now?
Trimpi: [01:03:06] He got a good job at Johns Hopkins. He’s still there. Johns
Hopkins gave him a job. I think a lot of other universities wouldn’t do it. For
some reason, they did. That was a hard period too.
Humburg: It must have been difficult to stop a friendship that had been long growing.
Trimpi: [01:03:26] It was. I had thought it was a debatable subject at least but he
didn’t.
Humburg: So that’s when you realized he wasn’t going to change?
Trimpi: [01:03:36] Yes, and he wasn’t just a fellow traveling liberal. He said, “We’ve
converted to Mao, Chairman Mao, Maoism.” Somebody got a hold of him in

47

Paris, I think. He also would take his family out to protests. He would take
his kids out to protests where they were in danger. I didn’t like that either.
You can be whatever you want politically, but you don’t take your kids into
danger. I didn’t like that about it either. Jane went along with him. That was
the only Stanford person I ever had that kind of ending to a friendship. The
rest were all friends, still are, those that are alive. Most of them are not.
Humburg: Is there anything else you’d like to add?
Trimpi: [01:04:27] No, I think I better read my poem. I hope I can read this decently.
Humburg: This is Autumn Drought?
Trimpi: [01:04:47] The epigraph is “In memory of Yvor Winters, Stanford University,
1976.” Do you remember the drought? Maybe you were too young to
remember it.
Humburg: No.
Trimpi: [01:05:05] It wasn’t as bad as this recent one but it was pretty bad and
everything got dry. I had not written any elegy for Winters. In fact, I hadn’t
even been thinking of writing one. I thought this would be a very good
theme. The theme of the poem is that the drought in nature is, to some
extent, echoed by what I call the drought or the decline of the quality of the
university. You may not like this but that’s the theme I chose. I was
disappointed in what the university had done in giving in to what I call the
“isms” and corrupting their great curriculum, which they had had up to that
point--not just the English Department, but the university, the humanities in
general. This is what I had to say at that point in time.

48

Autumn Drought, in memory of Yvor Winters, Stanford University,
1976
November brings no rain. Brown stubble blackens.
Torn paper litter, wind-blown with the leaves,
Piles up against dead stems. As traffic slackens,
Nightfall brings fear, and always now one grieves.
Where once I listened, lonely as these young,
But with some hope beyond what I could see
That meaning might be mastered by my tongue,
Anonymous process now claims them and me.
Perhaps the enterprise of mind is vain;
Where hucksters sell opinions, Knowledge fails,
Wit pandering to the market, for gross gain,
Corrupted words, false morals, falser tales.
Though one I loved taught here, provoking strife
By speaking truth about the human word,
And died--as few men do--ready for life,
I, teaching in his absence, seem absurd,
Seem almost unremembering, unawake.
And should his poems live--some consolation
To those who knew him and to those who take
His measure by their worth--their celebration
Will not be here, not where the idle gaze,
Touristic, slides past phoenix palms to stare
Where Mount Diablo dominates through haze
The ever-diminishing waters and the glare.
Trimpi: [01:08:07] By an anonymous process, I’m commenting on the rise of Silicon
Valley, which I think has affected the university immensely. The whole world
has kind of changed from what it was when I lived there and when I was in
school. I don’t know, maybe that was a worse drought than the current one,
but that’s a description of the campus. I think I started by noticing that and
then I got the idea for the poem. And how at nightfall, the traffic slackens.

49

You’ve been listening to traffic all day and you didn’t use to hear that in the
old days. Then I get in my affection for Winters and what I got from him-speaking truth about the human word. I mean his poetry criticism.
I don’t mention Janet but I certainly admired his wife too, and I think
her novels are wonderful. As I said, I’ve never known a woman who had so
many friends, and good ones too. Any other questions?
Humburg: No, other than help us understand your inspiration for the poem or what
prompted you to write it in the way that you did.
Trimpi: [01:09:43] Yes, it’s an elegy.
Humburg: In comparing in your own heart and in your own mind, the campus that you
spent so much time on as a student and as a teacher versus now, how would
you characterize the difference very briefly, the changes that you see?
Trimpi: [01:10:05] This isn’t new--I’m not the first person to say [it]--science and
engineering have become much more important than the humanities. That is
partly the humanities’ own fault. All the universities are suffering from the
loss of the quality of teaching Western Civilization. Stanford [was] always
good in engineering and the Medical School too is wonderful. The growth of
Silicon Valley, I think, has something to do with it. Someone can get a
Stanford degree as an engineer; they can get a job immediately, particularly in
high tech, just immediately. That’s made a difference, I think.
I don’t know about the student life, whether the student life is better
or worse. I know my daughter got an excellent education in art history, a
really good education. I wish we’d sent my other daughter, Alison, to

50

Stanford instead of Smith. That was a mistake. We should have kept her at
home and she would have got a better education. I’m sorry we sent her there.
Humburg:

Would you characterize the difference [at Stanford now as] the lesser
importance of the humanities compared to engineering?

Trimpi: [01:11:35] Just they’re turning out a different type of student. They’re turning
out engineers and high tech people. I don’t know whether their life, their
daily life is different or not, but I think they’re probably turning out very
good students in those fields, in engineering and high tech.
Humburg: How would you characterize the value of humanities in your life and in the
lives of others?
Trimpi: [01:12:06] With me, it’s number one in terms of learning. All I ever wanted to
do was study history and find out what mankind has thought right from the
beginning. That’s why I’ve always been interested in everything like
archeology or archeological digs or anything concerning our human history,
but especially the things that have been written, the great philosophers of the
classical period especially. Then the medieval period became even more
important. So reading and studying medieval philosophy. That was the
turning point. I wrote that in my interview with Wilson.
That was the turning point in my life--reading Thomistic theology
and all of the things that are contained in the theology and philosophy of the
Christian and Catholic Church. That’s what made the difference. I don’t
know whether that’s even taught anymore. Do they have medieval history at
Stanford anymore?
Humburg: I’m not sure.

51

Trimpi: [01:13:05] I bet they don’t.
Humburg: You’re really talking about the history of humans as a race on this planet?
Trimpi: [01:13:15] A humanity and particular Western rather than Eastern
Civilization. I know that’s a whole world out there and I know a lot of people
make that their main interest. But I really wanted to find the origins of my
own culture, my own civilization, which is American with a European
foundation. European civilization is the foundation of it. That’s what I’m
really interested in and always was, well as soon as I started learning anything.
I’m glad I didn’t waste any time either. I ran into good teachers right off the
bat.
Now I’m sure other people have had good experiences like my
daughter at Stanford. She had three wonderful art historians. She took classes
from all three of them. Then two of them went away and one of them stayed.
I can’t remember his name. He was very important to her, one of the
Stanford art historians.
Humburg:

Was she lucky enough to take classes from Eitner?

Trimpi: [01:14:11] Who?
Humburg: Lorenz Eitner.
Trimpi: [01:14:13] Eitner. That’s who it was. Lorenz Eitner. She did her dissertation
on Matteo di Giovanni, a Sienese painter. Oh boy, that was good. I couldn’t
have remembered his name.
Marine-Street1: I was wondering if Helen was aware of the debates going on around the
changing of the curriculum.

1

Natalie Marine-Street is the oral history program manager at Stanford Historical Society. She went with Judee
52

Trimpi: [01:14:39] I am. I read them all the time.
Marine-Street: Were you there during the time when they were debating whether or not to
change the curriculum?
Humburg: During the Study of Education at Stanford [SES], it would have been under
Wally Sterling [Wallace Sterling].
Trimpi: [01:14:54] Yes, I was there.
Humburg: Mark Mancall was heading up a lot of that work on looking at Western Civ
and-Trimpi: [01:15:00] I remember Mancall for some reason. I can’t recapitulate it but I
remember I followed those changes religiously. I wanted to know what they
were doing.
Humburg: How did you feel about changing the whole structure of Western Civ and
adding a lot of primary readings to it rather than just reading critical
summaries?
Trimpi: [01:15:22] I would want them to read the primary readings like we did. We
read passages--we didn’t read all of it--we read passages in Plato, Aristotle,
the medieval writers. We read the thing itself. That’s what I loved. That’s
where I first read Augustine’s Confessions. I didn’t read a book about it. We
read it. I think we had to read it through, as a matter of fact. That’s what I
want them to get back to. Now are they turning back toward that? I thought
I was following what Stanford was doing.
Humburg: My understanding was that one of the things that SES wanted to get back to
was to make sure that primary readings were part of Western Civ again.

Humburg to videotape the interview.
53

Trimpi: [01:16:03] Right. I get mixed up on the periods but I think they did make an
effort to restore it and I was all for it. I thought if they wanted to do black
studies or women’s studies or some of the other ones, like gender studies, if
Ken’s interested in that, he can do that on his own. That’s just a small part of
history. History’s much bigger than that, much bigger than those current
interests. They should spend their time reading things they would not
otherwise read. I mean, they wouldn’t, if they had a job, sit there and read St.
Augustine or Plato or Aristotle, they would follow in the newspapers those
other interests, or in the magazines.
Humburg: As you look back and reflect on all of your life at Stanford, do you have any
favorite memory?
Trimpi: [01:17:06] I have so many I couldn’t pick one out, except walking across the
Quad.
Humburg: Tell me about that. You’re smiling.
Trimpi: [01:17:15] I used to bring my lunch when I was an undergrad. In fact, I
always did. I rode a bike too. I rode a bike from Palo Alto where my mother
lived and sometimes I walked and sometimes, in those days, if you were
offered a ride, you took it because that was when gas was short. I would take
my sandwich and I’d go out in the middle of the Quad and sit in that little
palm circle in the middle of it and eat my sandwich. That’s a very happy
memory. Then the memory of going into the classes and learning, I loved
that. I was never interested in football till my senior year. You know what
football is at Stanford. It was 1948 and our coach had lost every single game.
There was a movement in the senior class to support the team. I, who had

54

never been to a football game, went to the Stanford-Cal game as part of
being a graduate, part of the senior class. [laughter] I never regretted it either.
Then there were a couple of guys on the Stanford Daily also whom I
became close friends with and they got me to go to the game too. That one
game, the Stanford-Cal game in 1948.
Humburg: Do you remember anything about the game that struck you as “Oh, I didn’t
know they did that?”
Trimpi: [01:18:33] No. I didn’t expect to understand what they were doing except
there was one end of the field and [there was] another end of the field. But I
became good friends with the kids on the Daily. That was a very good
experience. I remember that.
Humburg: What was it like being on the Daily staff at that time?
Trimpi: [01:18:51] I loved it. I loved writing my column. Another thing I did is I
wrote for the Palo Alto Times. They hired me when I was an undergraduate to
attend a series of lectures at Stanford, very interesting lectures, Tuesday
Night Lectures it was called. I would go and then I would write it up for the
Palo Alto Times. That was fun. I wouldn’t otherwise have gone to those
lectures. I don’t remember who gave them but they would come regularly
and give the lectures, and the paper paid me some good money.
Humburg: Those sound like some good memories.
Trimpi: [01:19:27] I told you all the memories are good. Let’s see, did I have any bad
memories? Not even with a boy. I didn’t go out with a lot of boys because I
liked to talk seriously and they didn’t always want to do that.

55

Humburg: Did you have any other favorite parts of campus besides the Quad? I know
in those days the campus was pretty much like a farm. I mean it was a lot
more open.
Trimpi: [01:19:54] It was. It was beautiful. One thing I’ve never forgotten is many of
those large garden plots, planted plots as you go through the university.
There were those vines which smelled so beautifully. I can remember walking
by them. That’s a very happy memory.
Humburg: The fragrance of the vines?
Trimpi: [01:20:20] Yes, the fragrance was wonderful. It’s still there. Last time I
walked the campus, they still planted that. A certain kind of ivy. I don’t
remember any dances or anything like that. I was never very good at dancing.
Humburg: Did you belong to any social clubs or organizations?
Trimpi: [01:20:46] When I first came as a freshman, I was a Catholic. I put down
Catholic but I wasn’t really a Catholic. I put it down because that’s what my
mother was and I got invited to join the Newman Club. I went once and
wasn’t interested in that. Then there was a club for off-campus kids,
Klahowya--a Chinook greeting or salutation--and I went to that for a while
because we all lived off campus and shared that. I told you I moved to a
dorm my junior year and there was a person I remember.
My roommate was a girl from Long Island, of all places, and she
wanted to become a doctor. She was doing pre-med at Stanford and her
name was Yolanda Einstein. She was brilliant. She was the smartest girl I ever
met at Stanford. She got her AB. We bonded because we had the same room
in Madrono. We shared a room together and we bonded for life. I just got

56

my Christmas letter from her this year. She went on to Harvard Medical
School. She was the first woman to be accepted by Harvard Medical School.
That tells you how smart she was.
She got an MD and she went on to have a wonderful life. She
practiced medicine all her adult life and married a very nice businessman and
had three children. She was a wonderful woman. She is a wonderful woman.
She’s got a lot of ailments now because she’s my age. Yolanda Einstein. She
was wonderful.
Humburg: And you’re still in touch.
Trimpi: [01:22:34] Yes. We’ve corresponded over Christmas. I visited her once in the
East or whenever she came west, she visited me. That’s a student I
remember at Stanford better than anybody else though I did know a lot of
really nice students, really nice guys and girls.
Humburg: Did you have big game festivities? Do you remember?
Trimpi: [01:22:57] I never took part. That’s why I told you about my senior year.
Senior year I went to the game and cheered. I think we lost to Cal. One of
the first women I met here at Eskaton [Eskaton Senior Living Community],
her husband was a football player for Cal. When the Stanford-Cal game came
up one of the years here, there was a clipping of him out in the lobby on a
winning touchdown for one of the Stanford-Cal games. [laughter]. If you say
you’re from Stanford, they look at you kind of funny--if they’re Cal
graduates. And then we’d get on together. I wish I had more things to think
of.
Humburg: You’ve given us wonderful stories. Thank you so much.

57

Trimpi: [01:23:54] I hope so. I hope I’ve told you the right things, things you like to
hear.
Humburg: Whatever you’ve had to say is the right thing.
Trimpi: [01:24:00] I can’t comment on the quality of the other faculties or anything
like that except that-Humburg: Were you aware that during the 1970s there was a gathering of women that
was starting to happen--women in the faculty who wanted to express
together the desire to advocate for greater equality for women?
Trimpi: [01:24:24] I think I was aware of all the gestures that the women’s movement
made and was not often very sympathetic. I’ll tell you one thing I did learn
when I went to Michigan State. There was a very strong women’s movement
there. Huge. I had a grad student in one of my classes. Toward the end of the
semester, she came to me and she said, “You know, Mrs. Trimpi, I’m having
problems because I want to take a class from one of our male professors, a
class in 18th century literature, and several of the women on the faculty had
come and talked to me. They had told me that if I took a class from that man
in 18th century and not from a woman, I would never receive a letter of
recommendation from any of the women on the department.”
I thought that was the worst kind of intimidation I had ever heard.
To keep a student out of a class by a man and to threaten that kind of
penalty. I think she might have decided to take it anyway. That was when I
realized the power of the woman’s movement. I mean, that’s power. It’s so
unfair. He was a good teacher. I thought he was a good teacher. You ever
run into that or hear about that? That wasn’t Stanford. That was Michigan

58

State, that was a big state university. They were among the most politicized,
the state universities.
Humburg: The 1970s is actually when a lot of that kind of advocacy activity was
beginning to happen on Stanford’s campus.
Trimpi: [01:26:12] Beginning. Maybe it was then all over the country but I didn’t run
into it because I wasn’t on the Stanford faculty in those years. I was off to
the side. When I was there, I never ran into anything like that or any
prejudice of the men against the women either. They made jokes about
Marge Bailey, but from student reports they knew she was a damn good
teacher and they wouldn’t think of not continuing her. They should have
promoted her. They should have but they didn’t. They did in her final year.
She retired as a full professor.
Humburg: If I’m thinking what I’ve heard you say, a lot of this also has to do with you
yourself. You didn’t have any direct aspirations yourself of wanting to be on
a tenure track.
Trimpi: [01:27:03] At that time, I didn’t. I might very well later. But it never came up
as an issue because I didn’t have time to teach fulltime. I had two kids and I
wanted to be home with them. Wes was fulltime, of course, and he would be
regularly promoted. It just didn’t become an issue with me. When I was a
lecturer, I was just happy to be hired as a lecturer and teach exactly the
amount of time I wanted to give to it.
Humburg: It fit into your life.
Trimpi: [01:27:30] Yes. I know a lot of women wanted to have a home and kids and
also be fulltime, and I knew one where the husband was on one end of the

59

continent and the wife was on the other. I thought, how can they do that? I
don’t know how they did it. They tried but I thought I don’t want to do that.
I don’t want to be torn between two different things. If I can just teach parttime, that’s exactly what I want. I didn’t have to teach anything I didn’t want.
Sometimes the professors have to. They have to teach something they don’t
feel qualified for. I just taught what I was qualified for.
I followed the women’s movement. I was kind of puzzled by it to tell
you the truth. I think a lot of women were maybe just unhappy. I don’t
know. I do know you had to publish if you were going to get advanced and
maybe they didn’t want to do that.
Humburg: Thank you.
Trimpi: [01:28:35] I wish I had some more funny stories to tell you.

Humburg: Can you tell me more about when you came to Stanford as an undergraduate?
You mentioned in our first interview that your mother worked in the canneries.
Trimpi: Yes there were several canneries around the area. In Palo Alto, it was the Sutter
Packing Company, which I think is now Fry’s Electronics. I think the name is
still on the building somewhere. They processed different fruits depending on
the season--apricots and peaches and one other fruit I don’t remember. I always
knew when the tomatoes came along it was the end of the season and time to
go back to college.
In the summer, I worked on the line. It paid well during the war--you
worked ten hours and you got full pay. Working on the line meant I picked out
the bad pieces as they sped by on the belt. One other college girl also worked on
the line. She tested for mold in the tomatoes with a special instrument that
when pushed into the tomato would indicate whether mold was present.
Humburg: As an off-campus student, you mentioned a social club being available for
students who did not live in the dorms. You also talked about being on the staff
of The Stanford Daily and the importance of this group for you.
Trimpi: The name of the social club was Klayhoya. They brought us together because we
didn’t have a dorm where we could meet other students. I made almost all my
friends on the Daily. It was a very informal, social group. We would go out for

beer now and then. One or two had cars so we would drive to the edge of Palo
Alto.
Then, I moved on campus. A dozen or so of us lived for one quarter in
old faculty houses. It was there I made my best friend, Yolanda Einstein from
New York. We are still friends and stay in touch.
Humburg: What were the circumstances of you becoming a lecturer in the English
Department and Creating Writing Program?
Trimpi: Yes, there were a half dozen faculty wives who were lecturers. We were teaching
fellows in the humanities and our salaries were very low. I taught English
literature from the beginning. My reading list started with Homer. I also took
over Winters’ course, The English Lyric, which I especially enjoyed.
I taught for seventeen years, one course per quarter. That way, I only had
to leave my daughters one day a week. I taught my husband how to do diapers.
He was hesitant at first. In their early years, I also had an au pair when the girls
got home from kindergarten. They went to the Peninsula School in Menlo Park.
I think it’s still there.
Humburg: Your first book of poetry was published in the late 1950s, I believe. Tell me
about that experience.
Trimpi: Yes. It was Stonewall Press, a specialized publishing house. They were
interested in publishing some of Winters’ students so I guess he wrote them
then he contacted me. I gathered my poems together and sent them to the
publisher. The book ended up winning the best in class for that press for the
year based on the quality of printing. This was a fine printing award for specialty
publishing houses so the book was only sent into limited circulation to

62

institutions and people who appreciate fine printing or poetry rather than being
available to the general public. The book was never really available to a wider
audience on the general market.
