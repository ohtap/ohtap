Webb:

This is Mimi Webb interviewing Dorothea Almond on August

11th, 1987.

Dorothea, Because the Child Care Program has already been

covered widely in Campus publications over the years, we don't

want to cover old ground. We'd like to knew what's not already

in the record. In your view, what constitutes a high quality

child care program?

Almond:

Oh, that's a big question. It depends whether we're talking

about center-based child care or day care hemes, and they're two

different stories. We have both kinds of programs at Stanford.

Would you like me to tell you something about what makes for

a good center? There are, generally speaking, four items which

are considered essential to good child care. It is availability,

accessibility, affordability, and a fourth one, which escapes me

at the moment, but we can come back to it. And we're very

0 fortunate at Stanford to have child care available. And it's

also accessible because one of our alms has always been to have child

care where parents live and/or work. Some of our parents live at

Stanford. Some work at Stanford and some do both.

But (what) we still wrestle with is affordability. Quality

child care is expensive and Stanford's child care is still

somewhat too expensive for lewer salaried staff. One of the

reasons child care is expensive and has to be expensive is that

it's important to keep the ratio of adults to children lew and

2
if you have infants you need almost three to one children to adults and if you want to pay your staff decently, which all of our center board's do, it gets to be a fairly expensive operation. One way we've tried to keep the costs somewhat lower is to have them all cooperatives, so that at least one staff position on the average is replaced by a parent, which makes it maybe one fourth less expensive in the salary range.
The Nursery School at Stanford is the most cooperative of all. It has one teacher in each classroom and several parents and it is the least expensive program, even though the quality is still quite high. The Children's Center has a ratio of staff to parent of about three or four to one. It varies somewhat because the Children's Center has a feature which is called "Buy-Out." It means that if it is absolutely impossible for a parent to be at the Center, he or she can pay for the cost of a substitute teacher for her time. The cooperative feature is one of the unusual facets of Stanford child care, and it has a very positive aspect which has nothing to do with the savings aspect, and that is that the parents knew exactly what goes on in the center and they feel they're part of it, and they can share their children's activities from week to week. Most parents come once a week to cooperate, so also they knew their children's teachers and they knew their children's friends by being actually in a working/playing situation with them.
The child care at Stanford gets quite a lot of support from Stanford University. And the fact that none of the centers at this point has to pay rent is a feature which again makes child care more affordable than it would be in a center in which rent

3

would have to be paid. And the Children's Center did a study

recently of centers in the area and Stanford was about average in

various aspects of features which were examined in that study. I

don't knew if you want me to go into that.

Webb:

When you first set up the program, which ideas were central

to your thinking?

Almond: Well, I wouldn't say I, or even Phyllis (Craig) and I set up the

programs. They were parent initiated in the beginning and we

stepped in really just as a support group.

Webb:

In the early coop years, hew were the qualities and

practices set? Parents want different things. Hew did you agree

on programs?

Almond:

Well, it was difficult. In the very beginning, which was

during the time of the student unrest in the late 60's, early

70's, parents had very fixed in one way and very vague in the

other way ideas of what they wanted in child care. The people

who wanted, at that time, preferably free child care now, felt

that they knew everything there was to knew about children and

hew they should be raised, and they did not even think they

needed a professional staff. And this is where we came in and

tried to make a point for the need for standards, standards of

hew you deal with children and hew you deal with groups of

children. And it depended very much on the sense of the parent

boards hew the philosophy went, and it took really quite a number

of years to have it filter through until there was what we would

consider very high standards of education and child development

in the centers. It was really thanks to Phyllis Craig's very

tactful intervention when she became the director for one year

4

when she became the Director for one year and the consultant to

the Dean of Student Affaire at the time when the center became

licensable. By that time in the State children's centers had to

become licensed. And in order to be licensed, they had to be

clean. They had to have washers and dryers and they had to have

a Director and they had to have eventually a professional staff.

Webb:

So you're saying that the State set some of the standards.

Almond:

Right. The state made it possible for us at Stanford to

reinforce the standards. There was really a mandate that

something had to be done. And that only took about a year and a

half to two years until that first, rather chaotic period was

overcome.

Webb:

And do you feel that some of the ideas that you and Riyllis

had for standards were compatible with the state standards, or

hew they differ?

Almond:

Well, the state standards were very what we might call

superficial. They were concerned with having the proper amount

of entrances and exits, the right size and number of bathroom

fixtures, and the ratio of children to teachers really only came

later. In the beginning it was really a question of was it

clean, was it healthy. And, of course, anybody, any adult would

say those were perfectly acceptable standards.

Webb:

What should the children knew? What should children be

taught?

Almond:

Well, that's a very general question.

Webb:

Did you have ideas about those things in setting up the

program?

Almond:

As I said, we did not set up the programs. The programs

5

evolved, and we could only maybe introduce literature or we could

talk about what's good for children, in terms of who are good

teachers, and who should they hire, and help on parent-teacher

committees so that good people would be hired. We're really not

talking about teacher in the ordinary sense who teach children

things, like in the elementary schools. If you have infants and

toddlers, it's something different, in learning hew to live with

other people, hew to live with other children, hew to live with

other adults, that gets conveyed by a teacher who knows child

development. You have to knew the stages of children, what to

expect at what age, and that's why it's important to have the

parents right there, because parents don't knew by instinct what

to expect from their children and especially academic parents

(who) always expect too much.

Webb:

Hew did you go about choosing the staff, or the care

providers for these children?

Almond:

Well, one important thing that Riyllis Craig set up right

from the beginning, and she had that also in her Princeton

University Nursery School, were committees of parents with

different functions, and one committee was a parent-staff

committee. And those committees wculd interview teachers. And

I'm sure these early committees had a lot to learn in how to

choose good teachers.

Webb:

Do you have any memories of hew you resolved differences

among the many people involved?

Almond:

Well, it took quite a bit of just listening to what people

wanted and then gradually conveying what would be acceptable

standards for those who took care of children.

6

But since everybody really had the welfare of children in

mind. Choosing teachers really was never a great problem. I mean,

after all, teachers do have references. They have a certain

amount of experience and I don't think there was much conflict in

that area. The conflict was much more between who pays and the

demands on staffers where we ran interference in the beginning.

Webb:

Hew did you deed with that?

Almond:

Again, by going to board meetings, spending a great deed of

time listening and then explaining what University finance was

like and what the University could afford, and that by expecting

too much they weren't going to get anywhere, but if they could

take it step by step the University would also listen and be

helpful.

Webb:

What prepared you for that role?

Almond:

Just a good deal of experience in living and dealing with

institutions and deeding with parents and young people.

Webb:

It sounds as though you have developed same negotiating

skills over the years.

Almond:

Yes, I guess so.

Webb:

Do you think of yourself as a negotiator?

Almond:

Not really. Not really. I must say fhyllis is much better

in that respect. She is a fabulous listener at board meetings.

She can sit through a whole controversy for a whole evening and

not say a word, and at the end she can summarize the situation

and come up with a question in which a solution is embedded, and

semehew everybody agrees that this is a brilliant idea.

Webb:

What kind of atmosphere did you try to provide in the

program?

7

Almond:

Well, again I would say we don't. This is really a question

of the directors, the boards and the teachers, with the

consultants being bystanders. The centers have over the years

developed their cwn philosophy. Even in the last year the

Children's Center spent hours defining their "mission," as they

called it, and, I would say, they try to have healthy, happy

children in their centers, having the centers good places for the

children to grew up. The atmosphere of the Children's Center has

always been fairly relaxed and open, and children - I'm always

amazed to see hew trusting these children are. They don't have

the usual shyness with adults. Even if you meet these children

in a totally different social situation, they have a much more

secure bearing than other children who have not been exposed to

that kind of environment.

Webb:

New, are you referring specifically to one program within

all your programs?

Almond:

Well, the one program which is the oldest and the largest -

it's almost unavoidable to focus on that because it's...

Webb:

So the children in it are different. You feel that they're

more trusting and open than the children in the other programs.

Almond:

Right. Not in other Stanford programs, but children who

have not been in child care, or not been in a good nursery

school. I'm also thinking more of the Children's Center because

it's the only one which has infants and toddlers. And if you

meet toddlers in the store or at a party, most toddlers are

either very shy and cling to their parents, or they became

obnoxious because they want their parents' attention. Whereas,

I've noticed at the Children's Center toddlers tend to gravitate

8

to other children and to play rather than try to interact

forcibly with adults.

Webb:

That's interesting. Hew would you say the child care

programs here at Stanford compare with programs at other places?

Almond:

Do you mean other places, other universities or other

centers?

Webb:

Well, whatever you're familiar with. What kind of

comparisons would you make?

Almond:

Well, there are centers that we call "Kentucky Fried

Children" places. You knew, they are chains of children's

centers which are pervasive all over the country. They have -

they look very nice on the outside, and they even look very

acceptable on the inside vdien you first go. And it takes a while

to realize what different places they are. They have many more

children in relation to teachers, to adults, for one thing. The

states permit, I think, twelve to one, and these commercial

centers are always at the limit of what's legal in state

licensing. The teachers are paid at the lowest possible salary,

so you get overworked teachers, harrassed by numbers of

children. And you get either restlessness or fatigue that you

can sense in the place.

Webb:

Are you saying that the restlessness and fatigue are in the

children or in the teachers?

Almond:

Both. It's a long day for the children. They often come at

7:30 and they stay there till 6:30. The parents have a long work

day with a lunch hour. And also the parents may have commute

time in addition. The teachers have long hours. I don't knew if

they're any set regulations, hew long teachers are allowed to

9
teach · I'm sure if scmebody sees a teacher teaching for eight hours they don't think that's particularly strenuous, but you should try it sometime. At our centers the teachers have humane hours, and there are two shifts of teachers, and there are part time arrangements for teachers, and the teachers have decent benefits, and there are all kinds of University perks that the teachers have by now. They can use the swimming pool and they can use the libraries, and they benefit generally from being on a university campus.
New these commercial centers have, of course, none of the university kind of benefits, and they also don't have really they don't have a union which could enforce same kind of teacher standards, so you get really a lot of burned out people in these centers. Also, another thing that goes on in these commercial centers is that the curriculum is set by some central agency, which can be in Denver or Kansas City, and they send the curriculum all over the country. New, Palo Alto has its cwn agency representing child care, which is Palo Alto Child Care Community, or PAC, and it also has very high standards. I think PAC is connected in some way with about thirty five nursery schools and children's centers, and their ratio of children to adults is also very good. The YWCA new has a children's center, and there are many other centers. Seme are connected with churches. The one prototype of an industry-based child care is sponsored by Syntex, which has a center for 100 children. It's located in Cubberley High School and it considers itself one of the best. I have only visited once so I should not really pass any judgment on it. There are

10

many other efforts to get industry involved in child care, but

that's a whole other story. I still consider Stanford the first

employer-based child care, and Stanford is the first sponsor of

employer-sponsored child care in Santa Clara County. Because

people always think of a university as only having students and

faculty, but Stanford is the largest employer on the

Mid-Peninsula, and many of cur children are staff children, not

student children. Especially, the Children's Center new serves

more mid and upper echelon staff than anything else. That's by

virtue of the fact that staff people are here and can put their

children on a waiting list at a very early time, whereas students

come in new and may need child care and cannot get in for a year

or two, so it's really the staff that gives the Center its

stability at this point. There's a whole area about this which

has to be thought through by the university, and we may have to

revise University policy in the next year.

Webb:

Do other universities have child care programs?

Almond:

Oh, yes. Almost all universities at this point have same

kind of child care. There are hundreds and hundreds of

programs. There are over three hundred members in the National

Coalition for Campus Child Care, which is an overall organization

which supports high quality child care on university and college

campuses. New they were started primarily in the Mid-West where

there are many and large state universities. And these child

care centers were right from the beginning supported by student

fees. There would be just an across-the-board student assessment

of, say, either fifty cents or a dollar a semester or a quarter,

which, when you have a campus of forty thousand students amounts

11

to an enormous amount of operating money, which we have never had

at Stanford. There's never been any support for the actual

operation of the centers. And quite deliberately a decision was

made by the Dean's Office that Stanford facilitates child care

but doesn't really support child care. That may be the wrong way

of putting it, facilitates child care but doesn't really invest

money in the operation of the centers.

Webb:

Hew does the Stanford program stack up against other

university programs?

Almond:

Well, I think it does very well. We have at Stanford good

child care and it's very coraprehensive; it's very varied, and,

numerically, I think, we have more child care and nursery schools

than almost any other campus, maybe with the exception of the

University of Ohio. Yale university has had a very different

history in its child care development. Yale has for decades had

a very strong emphasis in child development. It has had a child

study center for marry, many years, with some of the top people in

the field connected with it, and the child study center has

always had a nursery school where students would train to become

psychologists, child development experts, or people who teach in

the field, as well as nursery school teachers. The Psychiatry

Department at Yale has always been very strongly oriented tcward

Child Psychiatry, as has the Department of Psychology. The

professor who developed the Stanford-Binet I.Q. Test, and this

became one of the most respected nursery school, which new is the

Bing School, which is still on the campus, but it does not have

the support of the Psychology Department any longer, because the

Psychology Department developed in a different way. Bing School

12

new is still training teachers, but it trains them for the

Community Colleges and other agencies that do infant and nursery

school training. And we tried through the Council on Child Care

to bring some of the Bing experience into the Children's Center

by having quarterly meetings of the directors and by having

visits back and forth, but it isn't as if Bing was able to

sponsor what goes on in the other centers the way it is at Yale,

where the Child Study Center really sends its people in training

into the other centers, which then always acts like a yeast in

these different programs.

Webb:

Do you think that Stanford has ever been a model for other

programs?

Almond:

I think Stanford is considered a model in the child care

field to other programs. We do get calls from all over the

country, wanting to knew hew we got it started and hew we

developed the different programs we do have new, so even though I

have just stressed some of the negatives, it still is one of the

most respected, I think, and recognized programs on university

campuses.

Webb:

What is your biggest worry or your greatest concern about

the child care programs at Stanford?

Almond:

One of the worries that I have is the fact that we probably

don't even hear from the lower paid employees. The Children's Center has become known as being for the top administrators1

children and for faculty children and for being fairly expensive,

and people who live in East Palo Alto and Redwood City and work

at Stanford don't even apply to the centers and I'm concerned

about that. It seems to me that's not right if Stanford prides

13

itself on being an employer sponsoring child care, or at least

facilitating child care. There should be some mechanism by which

those who can't afford it still can take advantage of it.

Webb:

What would you suggest?

Almond:

Well, ideally I wish we could have built an endowment fund

into the Centenniary fundraising process. We do have a small

fund for which we do fundraising, but we've never brought it over

$10,000. and that doesn't generate many scholarships.

Webb:

Hew much money would you like? Hew much money would be very

helpful?

Almond:

Well, at least if there was an endowment of $100,000, if it

were well invested, ideally it should generate $10,000 a year

which would be seme support, so that one could consider a sliding

scale in the centers.

Webb:

What would that $10,000 a year buy?

Almond:

It wouldn't buy very much. It could either provide more

scholarship money to the centers or to individual parents, or it

could make it possible for the centers to move toward a sliding

scale system. New the centers have never wanted to have a

sliding scale system. Everybody pays the same. This has

something to do with its origin in the student movement. They'd

rather have scholarship money available, so that those who can't

afford it can be helped. What concerns me is that those who

can't afford it don't even apply, or many of those who can't

afford it.

Webb:

Can you compare child care programs in other countries? Do

you knew what's happenning internationally?

14

Almond:

Almost all other countries have state supported child care.

I don't knew as much about child care in other countries as,

forinstance, maternity leave. There are a hundred countries in

the world, including the developing countries, which have

maternity leave ranging from four months to a year, where women

get time off to spend at least four months or a year with their

new babies. And most of these are paid. The state steps in and

pays for the support, for the lack of income that the women have

during that time if they're working women. There's also more

maternity care built into almost all these hundred countries

around the world. Many of them have creches or some child care

systems.

Webb:

Children in the Stanford programs come from so many

different backgrounds. What are same of the differences that you

notice between today's children and those of about twenty years

ago. Just your own observations.

Almond:

I don't knew. I think we notice more the differences

between the different cultures that are at Stanford, which is

incredible. I think that in the nursery school there have been

more than thirty four different nationalities represented and, at

this time I would say there is a very large percentage of Asian

children and there's a great deal of cultural interactin going

on, which I think is one of the most wonderful features of these

centers.

Webb:

What are some of the cultural differences that you notice?

Do the children behave differently?

Almond:

The children certainly behave differently. They soon learn

American habits. They're probably all feu: better behaved

15

children to begin with than they end up, having been exposed to

American child-adult interaction. But it's wonderful hew the

more restrained cultured children come out during the nursery

school experience when they begin to sing out and to really share

their stories. I'm always amazed at the end of the year hew well

everybody gets along and hew quickly the children learn the

language. It's just fabulous at an early age. I mean, many

people come into cur office and say: "Well, my child doesn't

speak a word of English." And I say, "That's quite all right.

We're quite used to that. They'll learn very quickly. And

children sure very tolerant of other cultures and of other

languages. When they knew the adults accept it, the children

accept it right away. I think that's a wonderful learning

experience for little children.

Webb:

As you look at the parents of today's young children, hew do

they compare with the parents you dealt with in earlier years?

Almond:

Well, this has something to do with the change in who is

involved in the centers. In the beginning there were really more

students involved and there were actually union people involved.

They were very radicalized parents in the beginning and it was

quite grubby and very creative and very imaginative, but also

very undisciplined and the children could do anything. It was in

a way quite harrowing to watch, and at the same time quite

exciting. Where new (on) the boards of the children's centers

I'm always in awe of these incredibly efficient, highly motivated

and highly aamputerized parents (who) have a wealth of experience

in administration and, I mean, they're much more organized than

we old nursery school teachers ever were, and they don't mind any

16

length of time devoted to board meetings and to committee

meetings and working out statistics as to ratio of salaries

to fees and the vftxole complexity of a cooperative work

period and all of this. I mean, these are Yuppie parents,

very different from the original bunch of parents.

Webb:

What do you think are the greatest concerns of these parents

today?

Almond:

Well, their main concern is how to meet the budget. Really,

they're very serious about meeting the Center budget, which

approaches a million dollars a year new. And hew to adjust

adequate salaries and yet not to have to charge fees for the

child...out of sight. They're also very concerned about

evaluations, evaluations of staff, evaluation of the Director,

evaluation of the program. They take all these areas very

seriously.

Webb:

Up to new the children's program at Stanford has not been

used for research purposes. What do you think about using it as a

place to do research on early childhood?

Almond:

Well, I'm all for it. It's been one of my saddest

disappointments that nobody in any department of the university

has paid the slightest attention to these developing social

organisms right under their noses, and nobody is taking advantage

of the tremendous research possibilities there.

Webb:

What do you think could be done?

Almond:

Well, nothing short of changing the interest of departments,

which is not in the power of people.

Webb:

What kinds of information do you think is there for them to

get out? What kinds of studies would you suggest?

17

Almond:

There's so much criticism of child care, of care that is not

parental care, but is care by other adults of children, for their

most important years. New, we don't really knew yet what the

effect of being in the care of other adults will be on these

children. There could be longitudinal studies follcwing a child for quite some time, and follcwing the family, and follcwing child interaction and following child/adult interactions to see

what just being with other children a good part of the day - what effect it has on a child. Is it positive? Is it negative? There could be many outcomes. There's been such great concern

among psychiatrists of having, of separating mother and infant

too early. But hew do we knew what is too early? And I don't think you need to have a great variety of social stratification in order to do these studies. I mean, these are children growing

up, whether these are East Palo Alto children or children in Nigeria, or children on the Stanford campus. It doesn't matter. Children used to always be with their parents and new they are

cared for by other caring adults, and does it make a difference?

Or is it that when children are well cared for they turn out all right too. Or maybe they don't have as many problems of children who have constant interaction with their mother. But these would

be all interesting areas to explore.

Webb:

In the years you've been involved, many changes have

occurred on the child care scene, many social movements. What do

you think has produced these changes in child care?

Almond:

The main changes, I think, are due to the fact that more arid

more women have entered the work force. New, I think, well over

18

50% of mothers of pre-school children are in the work force,

therefore needing some form of child care. And the sheer quantity

has made quite a difference.

Webb:

Do you think that these changes have been good or bad for

children?

Almond:

Well, that's just the kind of thing I would like to find cut

scientifically. I don't think that any damage has been done yet,

but I would qualify this always by saying it has to be good child

care, high quality child care, not just anybody caring for

children or anybody caring for any number of children.

Webb:

Do you have any ideas about what the positive and negative

effects are likely to be on children? Does your instinct tell

you anything?

Almond:

Well, there have been studies of children on the kibbutz,

forinstance, where children have been separated from their

parents to a much larger extent, and Bruno Bettelheim, who, in

the beginning, did the first studies of that, and found that

these children have somewhat less affect than children who grew

up in a family only. He's changed his mind lately, so I wouldn't

venture to offer an opinion of really what happenned.

As I told you in the very beginning, I think children who

are with good caretakers, so that they really trust other adults

besides their parents, are more trusting people because they feel

that people are good and kind out there. They're not as

estranged from people other than their own families sis children

who have been exclusively with their cwn families for the first

five years. Now this may be over optimistic. I don't know.

19

But I feel too much child care may be detrimental. Too

much in the sense of too long a day. I don't like the idea of

young children being eight hours or more in child care. It's too

wearing. It's just like anybody else couldn't stand being with

other people all the time. And children don't have the luxury to

retreating to a stud/ and shutting off the world.

Webb:

You have mentioned some national child care organizations.

Would you describe your involvement in these organizations?

Almond:

Well, as I said before, I belong to the National Coalaition

on Campus Child Care, which deeds only with campus-based child

care. I belong to the National Association for the Education of

Young Children, which is a very large organization of early

childhood educators, and various other organizations. I used to

belong to the Ortho-Psychiatric Association, but I just don't

have time to either participate or even do the reading of their

voluminous productions. I do also - I mean personally - I belong

through the National Association for the Education of Young

Children - it has local affiliates - and I have participated

lately more than before in the Northern Clara organization,

mainly because the Santa Clara Community Child Care, which is the

main registration and licensing agency in San Jose, is opening an

office in Palo Alto, which is going to be a resource and referral

center for the northern peninsula.

Webb:

New hew have you participated? What sort of role have you

played?

Almond:

May I tell you about the Palo Alto Community Child Care Task

Force? I was a member of that task force, representing Stanford

Child Care, and that met for a whole year, in 1986-87. Well, I

20

what role I personally played. I can tell you more what the function of the task force was.

Webb:

Do you feel that you got ideas from them, or that they

benefited from ideas that you presented?

Almond:

I think I had a certain amount of influence and primarily in

the beginning. Everybody was gung ho for starting umpteen new

children's centers in the area, because there was this pressing

need of child care. And that's what most people think of when they think of child care. Let's have another center. And

building a center is extremely difficult. It takes a very long

time, hew to find just the real estate to put it on. It's very costly. The trend which is very prevalent in California is to go the family day care route and that is finding women who will take

care of a few children in their cwn homes, having little clusters

of places for young children. And I think one of the outcomes of the task force was to have a child care coordinator, mcbilizor,

administrator, one of whose functions would be to locate more day

care homes, and find training for them.

Webb:

Did you advocate that?

Almond:

Well, I was one who made a strong point that this is an

easier way to go. I forgot to mention that I belong to the - or we all belong to the California Child Care Resource and Referral

Network, which is the most important agency in California,

representing children's center and family day care. It's located in San Francisco, and it has representative offices in every county in California. Resource and Referral has become the sain

advocate for child care and the main facilitator for child care

in California.

21

Webb:

What do you think Stanford gets from participation in these

other groups?

Almond:

Well, I think Stanford gets to knew what goes on in the

world of child care, that is, we would be very parochial if we

didn't participate. I think Stanford could very nicely get on

without it, but it's just like having any other department and

not interacting with other universities or with other centers of

physics where exciting things go on. I think you just stagnate

if you don't bring in some ideas from other places and other

people.

Webb:

And what about Stanford's contribution to these other

groups?

Almond:

I think in the universityranraunityStanford is highly

regarded for what it has produced in the field of child care.

But, as far as other resource centers are concerned, I don't

think Stanford has done very much in the advocacy field, or in

making child care available to the less advantaged people. It's

hard to say, but it certainly is an outstanding model in

providing child care nursery schools and a network of day care

hemes.

Webb:

What kind of issues do you think still need to be addressed?

Almond:

Do you mean besides the affordability? well, I think

there's this whole issue of research which has not been

addressed. And the interaction with Bing, and Bing as a resource

is something that Stanford is wrestling with right new. And I

think Bing is a tremendous resource for child care and child care

could be a resource to people who do research at Bing.

Webb:

On a national level, which issues do you think need to be

22

Almond:

Oh, there are many issues that need to be addressed. I'm

very concerned with parental leave and with maternity policies which are being addressed. There's a bill before Congress. I

don't knew when it's going to come up for hearings which

Representative Schroeder is promoting. George Mitchell, who is, I think, the representative from Contra Costa county has had many hearings on child care. There is the ratio of families who need

chile care to what is available is just pathetic. I mean, it's

maybe ten to one. And we don't knew what happens to all the other children, whether they're taken care of by families or

women next door or left as latch key children, or even left

alone.

Webb:

Suppose there were no financial constraints and you were

able to formulate policy for the nation's children. What would

you want for them?

Almond:

Well, I want for them...first of all I would want for them

to have one or two parents able to stay at home same of the time

when they're first born. And, once they get to knew their children, and the children are firmly established physically and psychologically, then to have high quality child care available

for them to move into, preferably on a part time basis. And only

gradually to a full time basis. I mean, this is the best case, no holds barred. Women could stay home with their children and

wouldn't have to work in the early years.

Webb:

Do you think it would be preferable for children if they stayed at home?

Almond:

No, I don't mean that women should stay at home at all.

Webb:

No, if the children - for the children to stay at home.

23

Almond:

Well, I mean for children up to at least four to six months

to stay at home.

Second Interview with Dorothea Almond Conducted by Mimi Webb. August 25, 1987.

Webb

This is Mimi Webb interviewing Dorothea Almond in her study in her home in the hills above Palo Alto. It's August 25, 1987.

Dorothea, I understand that when your husband retired, a

special children's library at the children's center was

established in your honor. Can you tell me about that?

Almond:

It was a most ingenious present, which some of the

colleagues of my husband's and their wives had evolved. They had

a little committee in which they had decided that rather than

giving my husband a Stanford Chair or any other present, that a

contribution to the Children's Center would be very meaningful,

and what they gave us was not only a library consisting of a

hundred children's books, titles which had been collected from

the teachers in the Children's Center, but also a lovely wooden

placque with a nice dedication and a set of book plates with the

name of the Children's Center, naming it the Dorothea K. Almond

Library, and we are still using those book plates.

Webb:

Are you still using the books?

Almond:

Well, I'm sure the books are long gone. There is a

tremendous use of books in the Children's Center and they have to

be replenished constantly. I wish we still had a committee which

would collect children's books. It would be nice for the

Stanford Faculty Women's Club or some other organization to take

this on. But it's new just a part of a very large budget. It's

25

just a budget item among many others, the purchase of books. But

any donations are welcome.

Webb:

In our earlier session you mentioned Phyllis Craig's ability

to listen through long meetings. At the end she summarizes and

gets right to the heart of the matter. You've had a long

collaboration with Phyllis. Can you talk a little about your own

skills or personal qualities and how they mesh with Phyllis'

skills?

Almond:

Well, it's seems to me that's a question you should ask

Phyllis. It's quite remarkable hew over the years we have not

only gotten along, but really supplemented each other, and I

never tried to define what my contribution to it is. I know in

some way Phyllis is more of a, within the university, she's more

of an activist than I am, and I often act as a catalytic agent

for her when she can recapitulate sessions she's had in the

Dean's Office or in the Planning Office or wherever she's had

battles, and tell me about it. I need to be filled in for one

thing, but I think it's also quite useful to have somebody on

wham to, with wham to share these kinds of interactions.

Webb:

Has Phyllis attended more of the administration type

meetings than you?

Almond:

Yes, she is the one who really gets the new centers

mobilized and she is always evolving, always responding to new

needs in a very imaginative way. She started the - many years

ago she started an after school program when that was just

beginning to happen all over the country when that need arose.

She worked with somebody on starting an infant program.

26

Webb:

Hew would you characterize your own skills and your own role

compared to Phyllis?

Almond:

Well, partly it's being supportive. My own interests, vhile

they focus on the centers as well, I have a very strong interest

in child advocacy, and I tend more to go to conferences outside,

pertaining to child care, both the California Child Care Network

and the National Coed,ition for Campus Child Care. I'm not as

good as Fhyllis in tackling people to produce visible structures

and new facilities. I think I can work with people quite well.

I have sat through probably twenty years of Children's Center

board meetings and I have lived through all the turnover in

parents and the strum and drang of the expansion process and that

takes a certain kind of stamina too.

Webb:

Do you think that you work well with individuals and Ehyllis

works well with groups? Is that what you're saying?

Almond:

I think that's one way of putting it. I have always

basically wanted to be a child therapist and I really wanted to

work with children on a one to one basis, and I've just gotten

away from it in the hurly burly of the child care pressures.

Webb:

HOw did you happen to get into the child care program at

Stanford? Hew did you first get involved.

Almond:

I think I mentioned that Jing Lyman got us going. I think

that's on another tape already, no? In 1969 there was a group of

parents who had started a small group at the Stanford

Convalescent Center and they needed a building and it was Jing

Lyman who got a small group of us together within the Faculty

Women's Club to...she said, why don't you help those girls? So I

27

don't knew whether we called a meeting or whether we went

to one of their meetings, but that's really hew it started

originally,

Webb:

Who were those girls? Were they faculty wives?

Almond:

No, these were young parents, one representing Escondido

Village, one came from SIAC, representing the employees' union at

SLAC, and one came from the Medical Center. I think those were

the three original agitators for child care. And Jing Lyman had

a section in the Faculty Women's Club called "Continuing Educatin

and Employment for Women," something of that sort; it was a very

long title. And it was the beginning of women entering the work

force, and there were more women entering employment at Stanford,

or at least they were becoming more articulate.

Webb:

Do you remember what year that was?

Almond:

1969. Quite definitely. We date the beginning of child

care to 1969. In two years they're going to have their twentieth

anniversary.

Webb:

Can you characterize the various Stanford administrations

regarding child care policy? Hew would you describe your

contacts with President Sterling, President Pitzer, Lyman,

Kennedy?

Almond:

That's right. I think it started under...Yes, at the time

Jing Lyman got us going, she was.. .1 think Dick Lyman was

Provost, he was not yet president, and Pitzer was the president.

I think Pitzer really didn't have much to do with it. There were

other people running interference. I remember Bob Rosenzweig

being sort of the person who had to resonate to the child care

demands. I remember that we ran smack into the revolutionary

28

period at Stanford and child care became one of the hot issues.

And our group tried to run interference between agitating

students and the administration, which didn't really want to have

anything to do with it. It was a terrible fly in the ointment.

Webb:

This was the time of President Pitzer, not Sterling.

Almond

No, it was after Sterling.

Webb:

And Lyman was the next president. Hew did his

administration respond to child care?

Almond:

Well, let me go back to Pitzer. I remember that one very

dramatic moment occurred during President Pitzer's time when the

parents organized a march in honor of his birthday with signs

saying "Child Care New" and they marched actually on the

president's office, with the children bearing a birthday cake.

Webb:

For whem?

Almond:

For President Pitzer. They went right to Building 10. They

presented him with a birthday cake. He came cut and was very

friendly and premised to do better.

Webb:

Were there any results?

Almond:

I remember that we did get the Stanford Elementary School as

a site for the first children's center. There was something

called the Mason Committee, which was a land use committee, which

had to decide what to do with the site which is new

Pearce-Mitchell Emeritus Housing, and I remember testifying

before that committee and Roz Bacon testified for the Emeriti and

there was a terrible competition whether it should go to the old

or the young. And finally, at least on a temporary basis, the

child care forces won out. We got temporary use for child care

in that building. But with the definite understanding that once

29

the building plans for Emeritus housing were ready to go the site

would have to be relinquished. I think that was in Pitzer's and

the beginning Lyman administration. I'm not quite sure. Pitzer

was only there for two years so it may have been '69, '70.

Webb:

Did you have any contact with Pitzer's wife?

Almond:

Not at all, no. I don't think she played any role in campus

politics.

Webb:

And what about Lyman. What do you remember about his

administration in regard to child care policy?

Almond:

Well, as I think I mentioned to you before, Lyman saw child

care as a bottomless pit which would cost the university a lot of

money once they really got involved in it. On the other hand, he

had a very good person in his office who dealt with affirmative

action issues, Ann Minor, and she was enormously helpful. For

one thing, she persuaded me to get a study going. She said when

you want to get something in the university, you have to have

research done on the issue. So we contributed some money to

something that was later called the Child Care Policy Report,

1972.

Webb:

Who is "we?"

Almond:

Well, "we" was the child care section, and my husband and I

in particular. We contributed financially to this report. We

had to get a person to do it, to do the research., and Ann Minor

helped us find a person who had just gotten her Fh.D. in

Sociology and Education, which was a good examination.

Webb:

Was that Amy Leifer? (sp?)

Almond:

That was Amy Leifer. It's new knewn as The Leifer Report.

30

Webb:

Did you have a continuing relationship with Jing Lyman when

her husband became president? Did she continue to be interested?

Almond:

She continued to be very supportive. I don't knew hew much

direct influence she had but the climate wasn't ready yet for

child care, but she was in there helping, I'm sure, behind the

scenes since we got as much accomplished as we did. And one of

the developments that came cut of the Leifer Report was finding a

place within the administrative structure which would be

responsible for child care. And the decision was made it should

be in the Dean of Student Affairs Office.

Webb:

And new our current president, Kennedy. Can you describe

any contacts with him or anything about his policies toward child

care.

Almond:

I think he is basically quite supportive. We have very

little direct contact with him. It's more in the domain of the

Provost. Whatever comes up is sent down right away to the Dean

of Student Affairs, and then from the Dean of Student Affairs it

comes back to us whenever there's any kind of outside request for

child care, or any complaints that go directly to the president,

they're sent right dewn again to us. But I would say that the

atmosphere is considerably more user friendly than it used to

be. Just the fact that we were able to get a site for the new

center, even a good site. When we were looking for a site for

the Children's Center when it had to leave the Stanford

Elementary School, they were going to put us out in the

discontinued radiation lab area, way out on Stanford Avenue. The

structure is still there. And parents were just up in arms to

31

put children in a site that had had radiation research going.

New we got a site near the hospital.

Webb:

So new you are deeding mostly with the Dean of Student

Affairs Office.

Almond:

Right. We have for quite some time.

Webb:

Any specific people in that office who are helpful?

Almond:

We have a direct liaison person in Margaret Ann Fidler, who

has became very devoted to child care and fortunately she had two

children first go through our child care heme network and then

through the Children's Center, so she knews the situation from

the inside, and she's also an excellent person on budgetary

matters, practical matters.

Webb:

And what about your contacts with Jeanne Kennedy? Have you

dealt with her in regard to child care in any way?

Almond:

Yes. She was on the committee when the hospital based

center day care was in the planning stages. In her position as

community relations person for the hospital became involved in

that center, and she had rather grandiose plans. Millions didn't

faze her.

Webb:

Hew did you deal with that?

Almond:

Fhyllis was the person who chaired that committee and I

think they scaled it down somewhat where it became more realistic

for fundraising that could be done for child care.

Webb:

Who was going to do the fundraising?

Almond:

Well, it was a coming together of many people and many

agencies.

Webb:

Hew would you describe your other contacts with the

32

presidents and their wives, your contacts regarding other aspects

of university life?

Almond:

Do you mean personally or professionally?

Webb:

Well, either way, with any of the presidents and their

wives.

Almond:

Well, I spent a long evening sitting next to Dick Lyman on

the occasion of my husband's retirement. There was a tremendous

party at the Faculty Club. And I've always been good friends

with Jing Lyman. I've not known Jeanne Kennedy very well. I

mean, we knew each other but...and I didn't knew Mrs. Pitzer well

at all.

Webb:

Before the child care program started, Sterling, Wally

Sterling and his wife, Ann, were in the president's house, and

you were here then. Did you have any contacts with them at that

time?

Almond:

Well, we knew them quite well, and we'd been in their house

many times. I think we've had discussions with Ann Sterling

about child care. She didn't believe in it at all in the

beginning until she became a grandmother and her daughter was in

the situation of needing child care, and this has happenned to so

many people. And Roz Bacon, who was a declared enemy of child

care in the beginning, and, when her daughter-in-law had a

horrendous accident and needed very special kind of child care,

we were, I must say, very helpful finding somebody for the first

whole year, and I think the next year she became very

supportive. People really have to know what it's about

personally before they can identify with it.

33

Webb:

Dorothea, you have been associated with the early life

experiences of so many children in the Stanford Ctomrnunity. Let's

turn new to your early life. Can you describe the family setting

of your early years?

Almond:

Well, icy upbringing was very different from children \lho

grew up in children's centers. It couldn't be more different.

Maybe that's why I became so interested in groups of children. I

had, I must say, a rather lonely childhood. I was an only child

and I spent the first four years in what was then

Constantinople. Very carefully brought up by nurses and very

rarely saw other children. It was rather an artificial getting

together with somebody else's nurse and same other child who also

had a nurse, and we would go together and play in same sultan's

garden or something. But then we came back to Germany.

Webb:

Why were you in Constantinople?

Almond:

My father was Director of the Deutschebank, the German bank

in Constantinople, and had a semi-official functin representing

the economic and financial interests of Germany. This was during

World War I, before and during World War I.

Webb:

So you spent four years in Constantinope but your father had

been there for a longer period. Is that right?

Almond:

Yes, he had been there.

Webb:

And then you returned to Germany?

Almond:

Yes, there was a revolution in Turkey and a complete

breakdown at the end of the war and all the Germans were turned

out of Turkey, and my mother and I preceded my father in

returning to Germany and had a very traumatic return trip which

34

took three weeks in a wooden railroad car without windows in

November. We went through all the Balkan countries, which were

all in a state of revolt. Like the Russian revolution, there

were revolutins in Rumania, in Bulgaria, and it was very hit or

miss whether the particular carriage we were in was hitched up to

some train that was going west. It was an experience that my

mother never got over, it was so horrible. I mean, she had to go

begging to get something to eat for this little child. I felt

very grown up drinking coffee. That was the only thing that was

available that was hot.

Webb:

When you arrived back in Germany then did you have contact

with extended family?

Almond:

When we first came back, we got to Berlin, which was the

only place.. .it was during the influenza winter, and my mother

got very very sick and had to be hospitalized, and we couldn't

get back to the Rhineland which was cur heme because it was

occupied and there was apparently.. .transportation was cut off

between Berlin and the Rhineland, so we stayed that whole winter

in Berlin until we could get back to where my grandmother and my

mother's sister were living. I guess it was the next year.

Webb:

What about your father? When did he join you?

Almond:

Well, my father had to finish up the German affairs in

Turkey and was ordered to stay as long as he could and take care

of whatever finances had to be finished up there and that's why

he couldn't come with us and he joined us in Berlin. I don't

know whether it was two or three months later. And he also had

lost his position in the turmoil and we spent two years in Berlin

35

where he was given same minor office in the Deutschebank in

Berlin, but everything was in such chaos it was not the kind

of position he'd had before, but he later on then joined a

banking house in Cologne and we all returned to the

Ehineland and picked up the pieces.

Webb:

Can you describe those days in Cologne? Those early years

in Cologne, with cousins, with aunts, uncles?

Almond:

Well then the larger family became more in evidence and I

made seme of icy best friendships during those years. I found a

daughter of a distant relative. She was the youngest of five

much older children so she was in a similar position as mine and

we went to kindergarten together, and that's a friendship that

has lasted all these years. We later went to the Gymnasium

together for six years and have just been back together to our

fiftieth reunion.

Webb:

Is she still in Germany?

Almond:

No, no, no. She's in the United States too. She married a

very famous cellist, Emanual Freurmann (sp?) who unfortunately

died at a very early age, but he is still much admired by

cellists even in this country to this day. There's a whole group

of Freurmann devotees. They just made a hard disk of his old

records. It's amazing. Anyway, through her, I got introduced to

music and, because her family sponsored many musicians, and all

the famous quartets and soloists who came to Cologne would stay

at her house and practice, and I remember doing homework next

door while they were practicing their quartets or whatever it

was, a double concerto.

36

Webb:

What Is her name?

Almond:

Her name was Eva Reiferiberg.

Webb:

What does Eva do new?

Almond:

Well, she remarried many years later. She married a

mathematician by the name of John Lainson (sp?) and they have

just retired to a very interesting community in upper New York

state. She has kept up her contact with music and with musicians

very intensively, but also somewhere in the middle of it she also

became a nursery school teacher, so we have a lot in common.

Webb:

Can you talk about your early school days?

Almond:

My early school days were terrible. The reason for that, I

think new, is that the German school system was undergoing a

dramatic change from having children from the "quote" upper

classes go to private schools, then, suddenly everybody had to go

to public school for at least the first four years. And being

unfamiliar with the German school system, my mother was horrified

to expose me to thirty five children, and so she had me tutored

privately to catch up with the last grade that was still in a

private school; the private school was reduced one grade at a

time, and so I had to catch up and got into the middle of the

second grade, never having gone to school before, pre-school or

otherwise. And I always felt very much the youngest and inferior

to the other children because they seemed so much more

experienced, and I had a terrible time with writing. I was only

five, and to write at the level of a seven year old is something

quite different and it took me a long time to learn to write

properly. Besides, I think I was left-handed and of course I had

37

to be trained to write with my right hand. In those days

one didn't let children use the left hand.

Webb:

Why do you think ycur mother did that?

Almond:

Oh, a certain kind of snobbishness - I don't knew. She

wanted the best for me, and she didn't think going to a what was

called "Folkschule" would be so good. She probably also was

afraid in these large classes that they had in those schools that

I would get sick more. She had sort of a fear of illness which

was rather pervasive. I could imagine that that was one of the

reasons.

Webb:

Do you think that your parents both agreed on what kind of

education you should receive?

Almond:

I think so. I think my father kept out of it more or less.

He went along with what my mother decided was the right thing to

do.

Webb:

What kind of expectations do you think your family had for

you?

Almond:

Well, my mother was convinced that I would go to the

university in some way or other, which was rather strange because

it wasn't absolutely the natural thing at that time, but I knew

that she consulted with people from the academic community in

Cologne what would be the best high school for me to go to, and

everybody decided it had to be the Hananestischesmeschengymnasium

(sp?) which is the classical education. In Cologne at that time

they had several different options, and they were actually in

different schools. It wasn't like in high school here, where you

take different classes in the same school. People who wanted to

38

learn Greek and Latin and the emphasis on history and classical,

what was then called classical education, went to one kind of

school, and people who wanted to study sciences and math went to

anaother kind of school, and I was sent to the classical school, which was a girls1 school, and we had very small classes,

excellent teachers, and really it was a very good school, only I

was still limping frcan being the youngest and I thought I was

never quite caught up, so studying became very hard, and I think

I mentioned to you before that I knew I always wanted to work

with snail children and I didn't see that I was going in any

direction that was of any read interest to me.

Webb:

What kind of expectations do you think teachers had for you?

Almond:

I think they had the same expectations. You just had to do

well. And the teachers in this particular school were very

ambitious. We had to not only catch up with the boys, who had

started Latin in fourth grade - we only started when this

gymnasium started - I think it would be the equivalent of seventh

grade at junior high school. We had six years of Latin and four

years of Greek, where the boys started much earlier in both

languages, but we had to come out having covered the same

material. We all had to be able to read Plato and Thucydides in

Greek and we had a fabulous director of the school - a theologian

- and she taught religion as a subject, and we had to read the

New Testament in Greek. Besides, we had French. We had to have

Math and Physics and Chemistry and be as good as the children who

went to the scientific school, so the pressure of carrying

thirteen subjects and really to be good in all of them was

39

tremendous.

Webb:

How did that experience influence your views on child care?

Almond:

Well, it influenced my view on education. I think I became

a rabid progressive education advocate as a result of this strait

jacket that I was in. I'm pretty sure it had something to do

with that because I really had no preparation for being so

interested in liberal education as I became when I came to this

country, other than that I wanted something that was totally

different from the way I was raised.

Webb:

I understand that you had an aunt, I believe it was an aunt,

who took you to a Mdntessori School?

Almond:

Right. That was when I was ten years old. She had a little

boy and another family, a cousin. There were two little boys who

went to this Mbntessori School, and she took me for a visit. And

I decided then and there I was going to be a Mbntessori teacher.

Webb:

Had you heard about the Mbntessori program before your aunt

took you there?

Almond:

I'm not sure, but I think maybe she was the one who

mentioned it to me for the first time. And I think I read some of Maria Mbntessori1 s books subsequently.

Webb:

So do you feel that was a turning point in your life? The

exposure?

Almond:

Well, the exposure probably was, that it was the first time

I had seen a school for pre-school children, for one thing,

whether it was Montessori or not, I probably didn't knew there

were other kinds of pre-school education, but it got my interest

in small children aroused.

40

Webb:

Hew did you follow that up?

Almond:

Well, the only time in Germany that I got involved with

educational experiments was through friendship with people in a

country school, that was a certain kind of education which we

don't really have. Well, there are a few schools in this

country. It was a coeducational school in the country. There

were maybe five or six in Germany. And I had a friend who was

associated with that school and he took me for a visit and I

immediately immersed myself with this group of snail children

there, and the director of that school said they had never seen

anybody react to children the way I did. They were quite amazed

that these children took to me so quickly, but otherwise I didn't

have much contact with children until I started college

education.

Webb:

Were you aware of any role models that you had at that

time? Was there a teacher perhaps, who was a role model for you?

Almond:

Not in my Cologne situation. The people connected with this

Latschulheim (sp?) I admired very much, and I had also joined a

certain group in the youth movement in Germany that was a very

strong movement, long before the Hitler era, which had something

to do with taking hikes in the country and bringing back folk

music and they had a different approach to child rearing than the

traditional system.

Webb:

What was their approach?

Almond:

Well, it was more open, freer than the...it was sort of a

back-to-nature trend.

Webb:

Do you think that you have ever been a role model for

anyone?

41

Almond:

I imagine, I would say to a certain extent to my children.

They have all gone into something that I may have had something

to do with. I don't know what the young people in the various

centers think about me.

Webb:

What kind of influence do you think that you had on your own

children? What are their attitudes toward child care or early

childhood education?

Almond:

Well, it's not as direct as that. My oldest son became a

psychiatrist, and when I was teaching in Washington, D.C., I

remember he was five years old, and my husband was overseas and

one of the teachers at a wonderful school where I was teaching

stayed at our house and we both had contact with psychotherapy,

and the school was also psychoanalytically oriented, and he heard

a great deal about psychotherapy, counseling, helping children.

And I had gotten my master's degree in counseling and guidance,

so he sort of absorbed that kind of profession with his mother's

milk, I always think. I don't knew hew he feels about that new,

but I have a hunch that his going into medicine and then becoming

a psychotherapist had something to do with this.

And my second son, in a quite different way, he became

interested in conamunity involvement. He was a Yale when he

became a community worker. He worked with agencies in New Haven

that took care of.. .he worked in the Black community, which is

right adjacent to Yale and became a.. .well, during the years when

Yale had trouble during the student unrest period, he was so

active in the Black community that Kingman Brewster, the

43

president of Yale, asked him to come on over to the Yale side and

work within the university in community relations, and he has

always done a great deal with agencies that dealt with children.

Webb:

What is he doing new?

Almond:

Well, he has finally made the break, because his real

personal interest is in film, film producing and directing. And

he's long had two careers, and he has new come down more on the

film side, but the kind of films he makes are still involved with

children. It's interesting. He's done documentaries on the

Western addition, focusing on the schools and the people who work

with children. So indirectly there's an (influence) I think

Webb:

And you have another child, haven't you?

Almond:

Yes, I have a daughter. Now she is really not, well, I

don't knew that she's not in this field. She right now works for

Planned Parenthood. She's worked for many women's agencies,

counseling agencies.

Webb:

Are you aware of her attitudes toward early childhood

education or child care?

Almond:

Well, she believes in it strongly, and she thinks...she

can't understand that I think when she becomes a mother she

should stay home with her child.

Webb:

Do you?

Almond:

Well, we've had long conversations about this, and she

thinks, she says, when I mentioned that it's really a good idea

to be able to at least stay home for half a year with a baby, she

says: "But Mother, you're in child care. You should understand

that I can't afford to do that."

44

Webb:

So your daughter does not have any children right new?

Almond:

Well, she's pregnant right new. So, we'll see hew it's

going to come out?

Webb:

What about your sons? Do they have children?

Almond:

Yes, well, only the older one. He has three sons.

Webb:

And can you tell anything about...?

Almond:

Well, I was responsible for getting two of them into nursery

school. I've done my share of babysitting. In fact, one of the

reasons I got interested in child care at Stanford was because my

son was coming to Stanford with three small children at the time,

and I was hoping that they would take care of the child care,

but, of course, they went a different route and had somebody who

came to their house and took care of the children.

Webb:

Hew did you meet Gabriel? Tell us about that. We're really

skipping here.

Almond:

Yes. It was a very interesting, unexpected development. I

went back to Germany, after having studied here for a year, to

come in as a permanent resident under the quota. And on the way

back to Germany I met a very charming young woman, again because

I was playing with her child on the boat; she had a two year

old. She was going back to visit her parents who were still in

Germany, and we were both going back with great trepidation as to

whether we would get out again safely, and...

Webb:

What year was this?

Almond:

1935. And we were both Jewish, and the conditions had

became more dangerous since I had left in '34. And she said,

"Well, when you get back to New York, be sure you call me and

45

tell me hew it went, whether you got out all right." And so,

when I came back in September to Columbia I did call her. And

she said, "Oh, you must come to a party we're having." And she

gave me a time and place and I went. And her husband had invited

Gabriel, who was a pre-doctoral fellcw. He had a fellowship from

the Social Science Research Council. He was from Chicago and

studies in New York for that year, and he knew Hans Spier (sp? -

Beyer?), who was a sociologist at the New School for Social

Research, and that's where we met - at this party.

Webb:

Was it love at first si#it?

Almond:

Well, just about. I mean, he took it on from there and we

started dating from that time on. It didn't take very long. We

got married in '37, and this was winter '35. We got married in

April '37.

Webb:

And he was an American.

Almond:

He was an American. Right.

Webb:

And I remember that you said you were happy that you had

finally met an American young man, rather than a refugee.

Webb:

Up until then most of your contacts had been with Europeans

in New York?

Almond:

Right. Well, that isn't so. I went to college and I had a

lot of college friends, but, having.. .somehow they seemed very

youg and immature, not having had the experience of being a

refugee and losing your country, they just came merrily from high

school and they went to football games, and we didn't have much

in common in the beginning. And the second year when I was at

Columbia I took an apartment with a cousin of mine who had then

46

just came over, and we lived on Amsterdam Avenue, had a high old

time being independent, and she was a musician and she had

musician friends and it seemed much more interesting. But most

of her friends were refugees, and that's why when I finally had a

date with an American that seemed quite remarkable.

Webb:

What kind of life did you envision as Gabriel's wife?

Almond:

I don't think I had much of a notion. But I had always

wanted to be in an academic setting. Even in Oologne when I went

to school I sort of had a great contempt for the circle of

friends that my parents had and always tried to make friends with

people who had something to do with the university or people who

had same professional connections, and so it seemed quite

natural. · .1 sort of slid quite easily to graduate student and

then post-doctoral fellow life.

Webb:

Hew would you characterize your parents' friends?

Almond:

Well, I'm sure they were fine people, but they seemed to me

so terribly materialistic at the time. New this was from an

adolescent's point of view, since they were mostly involved in

banking and in industry, and that wasn't what I thought was a

high objective in life.

Webb:

So you really gravitated toward the academic scene. Is your

life anything like the way you imagined it would be?

Almond:

Well, our life originally was very different. I mean, we

lived on a shoestring. And, having come from a rather different

background, that was... I just relished it. I really enjoyed

being on a tight budget, and having the feeling we were just

living on what we could make ourselves...

47

Webb:

Hew do you explain that appeal?

Almond:

It's a sort of perverse need for limits or something, or

having more lofty goals than material ones maybe. That's the

only way to understand. I mean, I later found that academics can

be just as ambitious, I mean, some academics, in a materialistic

Webb:

Were you a working wife when you first got married?

Almond:

No, I wasn't. Well, I worked part time most of the time,

actually. I mean, I wasn't a working wife with a vengeance. We

had our first child right away, and I finished my master's degree

after I already had my first child. I always had the idea that I

had to keep going, at least partly, but it was still unusual at

that time and I was still feeling very guilty when I had to be

away from home and leave Rick with somebody else. There weren't

any children's center. You knew, if you were lucky you got a

cleaning woman and you left your child with the cleaning woman.

Later on he went to nursery school and for four years we went to

the same school. I taught three-year-olds and he was four at the

time, and, from the time he was four to eight, he was in the same

school where I was teaching.

Webb:

Did your husband ever help out with the household duties or

with child care?

Almond:

He helped quite a bit. He really was a very advanced father

and husband for that time.

Webb:

Hew did he feel about your interest in working with

children?

Almond:

Oh, he tolerated it. I don't think he thought it was a

I 1 1 1 ! Ill tJ I lift
iI · I

48

great intellectual enterprise, but he just let me be.

Webb:

Hew did he feel about having a working wife?

Almond:

Well, later on, when he got on in life, in his professional

life, I think he would have liked it if I had done more

entertaining, which sort of goes with being a faculty wife. It's

only in that sense that he resented it at times. There just

wasn't enough time for domestic things or getting involved in

housekeeping or order. I mean, things got rather chaotic at

times.

Webb:

What do you think he expected of you in terms of being a

faculty wife?

Almond:

Well, as I said, if I had done entertaining more easily and

had focused on more on that part of being a faculty wife, I think

he missed that I had a certain amount of contempt for that kind

of existence, and to me, my work professionally was more

meaningful than spending a lot of time cooking gourmet dinners.

Webb:

Were there other faculty wives who also worked?

Almond:

well, we had an interesting group in North Haven,

Connecticut where same of the women were professional. Many had

given up working. Many had had advanced degrees and were not

working. And we formed a housing coop, with which I spent a good

deal of time developing a housing cooperative project.

Webb:

Explain what that is.

Almond:

Well, it's quite famous new in the Yale community.

Actually, I found a beautiful lodge next to a very good

elementary school in North Haven, which is north of New Haven,

and we formed a cooperative where we started with fcur families

49

and it was later expanded to nine families. We all hired one

architect and built cheap houses on that hill. We actually never

built ours because we moved to Princeton before the project was

completed.

Webb:

They were individual houses?

Almond:

They were individual houses. We all wanted modern houses.

We wanted convenient houses and we wanted to share a certain

amount of the housekeeping and there were great debates whether

we should have one communal laundry, or whether each house should

have a washing machine. And the most fun were two years of

meetings before a stone was turned. And we became very close

friends. They're still among our best friends, this group.

Webb:

But then you never actually lived there but you were in the

planning process.

Almond:

Right. And I found the land, which I was always very proud

of.

Webb:

Well, then, how did they work it cut? Did they do things

like share child care responsibilities?

Almond:

They shared a great deal of child care. They had a big

circle in the center of the ten acres, I think, that we bought,

that was a children's playground. It was a wonderful facility.

It had a very very peculiar reputation in the Yale community.

These crazy professors out there who built these modern houses

and I'm sure they thought we were all Communists. Those people

vfrxo want to mix up cooperation with communism.

Webb:

And you were working through all this period?

Almond:

Yes, I was at that time I had a special appointment from the

50

Superintendent of Schools in North Haven, Connecticut, and

was in charge of deviant children. They didn't have special

classes yet and he asked me to take on children who, for

some reason or other, couldn't go to school. I mean it was

wild. Seme of the children were so mentally disoriented. I

won't say there weren't facilities, but there were families

who would not send their children to facilities that could

have helped those children. At least I remember one case

where all I could do was take the boy fishing. It was the

only way I could establish contact with him.

Webb:

But, with the other children, what did you do? Heme visits?

Almond:

Home visits. I would try to teach them whatever was possible

in their cwn hemes. And I think I had some contact with the

Child Stud/ Center at Yale. You knew, just taking some classes.

Webb:

Then, when you came to Stanford, what were seme of your

first impressions when you arrived here?

Almond:

Well, we had spent a whole year at the Behavioral Sciences

Center, which was Shangri La at the time for us.

Webb: Almond:

What year was that? That was 156-' 57, and, after coming with great reluctance,

because again I had to stop what I was doing - that time we came

from Princeton, where I was a counselor at a neuropsychiatric

institute in New Jersey, and I had to interrupt to ccme to

Stanford so I came with a certain resistance, but it was very

quickly overcome by the beauty of the place and being in Palo

Alto and Stanford in the fifties was really wonderful. It was

before Silicon Valley and it was still covered with fruit trees

and blossoms in the Spring, and we had a very exciting group of

I "Hvriinm .1 · tii

51

of people at the Center. We were very congenial, and I think

I've seen more of San Francisco during that year than in the

thirty years thereafter. And we made a lot of friends outside

the Stanford community.

Webb:

Hew did it compare to Princeton?

Almond:

Well, it was very different. It really seemed much more

open. There was much more interaction with people frcm different

departments. Many of the friends we made that year were in the

physics department. We became friends with the director of the

Stanford Press and with Dan Mondello (sp?) and his wife and

painting and art and it seemed in Princeton we were much more

restricted to people who were in political science.

Webb:

Hew do you explain that?

Almond:

Well, I think Stanford was just a newer place and people who

came here were more open to new relationships and new ideas. I

mean, it's a very flip answer but...

Webb:

What was expected of you as a faculty wife at Princeton?

Did you have any special obligations?

Almond:

I don't think so. We came to Princeton under rather unusual

circumstances. My husband came as a member of the Institute of

International Studies at Yale, and when President Griswold became

president of Yale he said he didn't believe in group research and

he discontinued - wanted to discontinue - the Institute. And,

like a football, Princeton picked up the pass and invited the

whole institute dewn, and there were six, I think, full

professors who came dewn, or people in various shadings of

professors. It was an overload for Princeton, for the

52

department. It was an administrative decision rather than a

departmental decision. So we never became quite integrated in the

Political Science Department at Princeton, so that I don't knew

what the expectations were, on me in particular.

Webb:

You didn't feel any pressures to perform?

Almond:

No, not particularly. We did try to befriend graduate

students who were studying with my husband, and it seems to me

that our friendships at Princeton were almost among

non-university people. I mean I got, as usual, involved in the

school systems and school related problems and people. My

youngest was one year old when we came to Princeton and she went

through nursery school with Riyllis Craig at Princeton and I was

very active in that nursery school, and later started to work in

this neuropsychiatric institute outside of Princeton.

I also had my own family nearby. My mother lived in

Plainfield, New Jersey, which was the one time we had close

family nearby, and I had a cousin, who was a most interesting

personality. He was a paraplegic and lived with my mother's

brother in Plainfield, and a very romantic situation developed,

where a friend of mine came over from Germany, and, to make a

long story short, I was instrumental in bringing her out, and the

two of them became engaged and got married. And we were again

instrumented in getting them out of Plainfield and to Princeton,

and they started a whole new life in Princeton, and we were

almost like their sponsors, which took a lot of my psychic

energy, unfortunately, they came, I think, in 1955, and we left

for Stanford and the Center in '56, but, when we then came back

53

and had another three or four years with them. So I didn't really

get terribly involved in the academic social life in the

department at Princeton, which was quite different from when we

finally arrived at Stanford.

Webb:

Well, when you returned to Stanford, hew did the experience

compare to your first time at Stanford?

Almond:

When we came back to Stanford it was with the understanding

that my husband would become department chairman and would

really...

Webb:

Immediately?

Almond:

Immediately. But the next year there was an acting

chairman, and that he would pull up the department and make it a

department of world standing, which it wasn't before, and so we

had quite a job to do within the department, and it was quite a

different. I mean, he had written by that time a lot of books

and had become very well known. And he was never recognized in

Princeton, I think, in that capacity. He was known all over the

world and I think he was really appreciated at Princeton in spite

of the fact that President Dodd told him when he first

contemplated coming to Stanford that one doesn't move from

Princeton to Stanford. So that he had a much more exposed

position here, responsible position in bringing other people to

the department. It was also more representative.

Webb:

What was it like for you and the children?

Almond:

Well, I made the great mistake when we first came here - we

had been here intermitently and I had been one summer acting

director of the Peninsula Children's Center, and I had assumed

54

that when I came back I would find a happy haven at the Peninsula

Children's Center again because of the first time around, they

were begging me to stay, and we were headed for Japan and around

the world and there was no way of staying with the center. So

when we came back I assumed I could also get back to my own

professional life, and, in the meantime they had gotten a new

director and the only position I could have was that of a

teacher.

Webb:

So you were teaching...

Almond:

I was teaching at Peninsula Children's Center when it was

still on Alpine Road in a very primitive old house that Stanford

owned. The staff there had changed completely since 1962 when I

was there the first time, and had developed in a very strange

fashion, which I don't want to go into, but I found myself always

as a committee of one against all the rest of the staff. (This)

culminated in the day when Kennedy was assassinated, and the

whole staff huddled together in the Director's Room listening to

the radio, while I was left alone with all the children. It was

sort of typical, because my battle was always that disturbed

children need order in a system and limits and a tight daily

routine, and the rest of the staff thought I was just obsessed

with neatness and order, which is the last thing lam, but I knew

what to do with disturbed children, and you don't leave them

alone and you don't.. .well, anyway, I had a terrible year and

this was our first year at Stanford, and I wished I had never

tried to work that year. It was very unfortunate. It was a very

unfortunate experience and not typical at all of our life at

55

Stanford. And the Center has since changed completely. It has a

fine director and it's became a great agency. I'm just sorry I

wasn't part of it. I had to leave. But fortunately, after the

first year, my husband became chairman of the department and

there was no way for me to continue in my own work for a while.

He really needed me at home. I mean, he needed me as a helpmeet

and so I stopped working and really tried to befriend the

faculty, the Political Science faculty, and make it into a

cohesive group of people. Especially, he was bringing new people

all the time and they needed to be entertained and shewn around,

and so I saw that as my primary function.

Webb:

And hew did you fulfill that role? What kinds of things did

you do with the other faculty?

Almond:

Well, forinstance, we gave three parties I remember that

first winter, where we divided the faculty in three groups and

then had all the graduate students at the same time in three

groups and so that there would be a mingling of faculty and

graduate students and it was a crazy idea of mine. I don't know

if it worked too well, but it was a lot of fun.

Webb:

Was it a lot of fun for you to do that?

Almond:

Well, fortunately, I had a wonderful Japanese young woman

here with us for two years. And it was just during those two

years so that I had help at home. She went to school from here.

She went to Notre Dame and went to college, but she was

incredibly good with household work. I could never have done

that by myself. She helped me do it.

Webb:

What did she actually do? Did she prepare food or clean the

house?

56

You knew, everything she would do without being told. She really

kept the house together that first year when I was working full

time at the FCC and we were new here. She did all the housework

and cooking, and the second year we both did it together. She

was just remarkable. Then she got together with a graduate

student from Berkeley and got married from our house, and that

was the end of that year. We ended that year with a big

marriage, big wedding here.

Webb:

Can you describe interaction between the faculty wives. Do

you think the faculty wives in the political science department,

forinstance, had associations with each other?

Almond:

I don't knew. I don't knew whether they had.. .1 mean,

certain people associated with certain people. It never became

terribly intimate. There were a lot of women who actually were

professional women and had their own lives. They went their own

way. T Ulcw (sp) was in child psychiatry, and other people

were doing other things. I mean we did a certain amount of

formal entertaining. But I wouldn't say that, except when the

Georges came, they became very good personal friends. I don't

knew whether it's different. I think we saw a lot of people in

physics who were our friends from the Center year. And I think

they have a lot more cohesiveness than political science. In

spite of our efforts, I don't think it ever quite jelled.

Webb:

Hew many years was your husband department chairman in

political science?

Almond:

I think...we came in '64. I'd really have to check whether

he was chairman all the while until he retired. He was chairman

a long time.

57

Almond:

No, no, no, no. It was ten years, ten or twelve years. I'd

have to check with him. I don't remember when he stepped being

chairman because he stayed on so long after he retired. I mean

he kept teaching and he kept having graduate students. And there

were varicus chairman.

Webb:

What kind of contact did you have with students, including

graduate students?

Almond:

Well, we had numbers of students over.

Webb:

For dinner?

Almond:

For dinner, or for lunch a lot. He always gave a particular

seminar to a small group of maybe twelve or fifteen students.

And we had the tradition of having them at least over for the

last class. The last class was always here and was a luncheon.

I think most of these classes, these seminars were actually at

the house. So I got to know certain years of students quite

well.

Webb:

Did you participate in the seminars?

Almond:

Well, the only seminar where I really participated was a

freshman seminar that we did quite early on, that we both gave,

with a man who's now the head of the alumni.

Webb:

Bill Stone?

Almond:

Yes, with Bill Stone. He was a graduate student then in the

Business School and why he was assigned to this freshman seminar

I don't knew. It was a lot of fun. But there were certain

groups, certain cohorts in these ten or twelve years that we

became very close to. They're all now department chairmen sill

over the country in different positions.

Webb:

Have you maintained contact with them? Do you see them

59

Almond:

We do. Whenever they're in the area. Well, of course,

there is this one in Germany who comes almost annually. He's

with the U.N. frequently and always comes out to see us. And

this is the same with graduate students. Princeton or Yale, we

still are good friends. One is now acting president of the

University of Wisconsin and one is something close to the Provost

at Harvard, one of our best friends. We have graduate students

everywhere it seems.

Webb:

You said that you didn't work for a couple of years when

your husband became department chairman. Do you remember how

many years that was that you stopped working?

Almond:

I think I stopped working after our first year here.

' 63-' 64 and I really didn't get back into anything until I got

into the child care situation. In the meantime, my husband was

not only chairman of the department, he became president of the

Political Science Association, so he had to be in Washington, he

had to be at regional meetings, and all over the place, and I had

to be both at heme and when he was home, there were lots of

things to do. He had to catch up.

Webb:

Did you travel with him?

Almond:

To a certain extent. I didn't go to all.. .1 still had my

daughter here who was going through some difficult years and I

felt I had to be home a good deal. I worked, actually I got

quite involved with the Gunn PTA when she was in high school.

Webb:

So you were a more traditional faculty wife for a few

years. Hew did that feel?

Almond:

That was rather frustrating in a way. I mean, it wasn't

that I wasn't active. I always managed to get involved in school

60

a while of my own goal, say, a sort of internalized goal. But it

was kind of exciting to go to Washington and to have the

presidential suite and to participate in these larger affairs and

meet interesting people.

It was broadening in another sense. Because when you're in

the Political Science Association, the year before, you're not

vice president, but something similar, which is one year, and

then you have the presidential year, at the end of which the

president makes a major speech, so these are very absorbing

years, so I think that if I had also had a career it would have

been very very stressful. It was stressful enough as it was. I

don't think anybody today.. .most people even stop teaching when

they are president of a major professional organization, and he

tried to do.. .he taught all the while and he wrote and he did

research, and he had to travel. It was just ghastly, and I

contribute his heart condition to that period. At least as the

thing that set it off. He just tried to do too much. And I

would feel absolutely terrible if I had tried to pursue a career

during that time. Then I would be sure that it was all my fault.

Webb:

So you really did support his activities during the time

that he was department chairman.

Almond:

Well, I hope I did.

Webb:

Hew do you describe his role in your activities? Do you

feel that he ever played an active role?

Almond:

Not very active, no. Not really. There has always been a

slight touch of jealousy between my professional interests and as

though it was always at the cost of something. I mean, if I did

have to write something he would consent to read it and make it a

61

better style or make suggestins or edit or something of

that sort where he could really be helpful. And, I guess,

compared to most people, he really has been supportive.

He's never been actively not supportive.

Webb:

At each stage in his career, did that mark a turning point

for you?

Almond:

Well, each stage meant another move and with three children,

and at least a part time professional life, it was a wrench every

time, and I don't move easily. And, you know, there are military

wives who move all the time and it doesn't seem to mean

anything. But it meant a different community and making new

friends and getting the children in new schools and starting over

again, trying to find something I could do without it's being too

intrusive. So it was difficult.

Webb:

Do you think that your attitudes affected your husband's

decisions about moving?

Almond:

Oh, I'm sure it made it more painful for him. I'm sure he

felt guilty, but he had to do what he had to do. I'm sure, had I

been more mature, I would have done it differently.

Webb:

As you look at young faculty wives today, hew would you say

the role of faculty wife has changed since you were just starting

out?

Almond:

Well, I think most, not only faculty wives, I think most

wives have a totally different attitude new towards marriage and

towards family, and especially since the "me generation," you

knew, their careers ccme first. It's partly econcmically

necessary and partly for the women's movement that we see it

again and again in young families. It becomes a terrible

62

I think it takes a very mature relationship to work that out to

the satisfaction of both parties. And I think men are beginning

to see that they can also subordinate a career step to a wife's

career. My husband can't understand it when he makes it possible

for a graduate student to go to a wonderful university, have a

great appointment, and he doesn't take it because his wife is

where they are and there isn't a job as good as that for the

wife. Or she would have to take a gamble in coming along. And

when the man turns it down, my husband can't understand it. He

thinks it's hair raising. And it happens more and more.

Webb:

Do you think you're more understanding of that?

Almond:

I am. But then I can understand people having very high

standards for their own professional performance. I mean, I've

been an academic wife long enough to honor that standard. But I

feel that there are other things in life that are important.

Webb:

Like vfriat? What are same of those other things?

Almond:

Well, relationships and treasuring what is important to the

other person.

Webb:

Besides child care which has been really your major pursuit,

what other issues are most important to you?

Almond:

What do you mean by issues?

Webb:

Well, perhaps I shouldn't call it issues.. .concerns or

interests? Interests, what other interests do you have?

Almond:

Well, child care is really a late-in-life interest of mine.

I mean, I've always been interested in children, but I used to be

much more interested in the mental health aspect of children.

And if I hadn't been somewhat handicapped with all these moves I

probably would have gotten myself certification in psychotherapy

63

Child, marriage and family counselors. California has a special

degree for that. And I've gotten away from this interest in

psychotherapy. Primarily since icy children arrived on the scene

here in the Psychiatry Department. I figure there are enough

Almonds in mental health. I better stay out of it.

Since the child care came along and I sort of skidded into

that, I wasn't an advocate in my early years.

Webb:

But you've always been interested in children and what's

good for children. You mentioned to me earlier your interest in

music. It seems as though music is a very important aspect of

your life.

Almond:

Yes. I'm not actively...I mean, I'm not a musician, but I

think because of these childhood influences, I've heard a lot of

music all my life and feel very close to music, and I miss it

when I don't go to concerts. I'm a great supporter of the Palo

Alto Chamber Orchestra.

Webb:

Is there anything that we haven't covered adequately that

you'd like to talk about?

Almond:

Well, I think, as I mentioned to you before you turned on

the tape, I don't feel I made it quite clear what all this child

care is doing for Stanford as an institution. Do you want me to

talk about that a while?

As I have observed, what particularly the Children's Center

has done for young families at Stanford, I'd say for graduate

students and administrative staff and faculty families and young

faculty families, especially young faculty women teaching,

professors who have children. I feel that not only do they have

a good place for their children, but they have found a community

1i1i1i11'iiIIiIiillll t ill

64
in the Children's Center which is quite extraordinary. It's quite a support group, which you rarely find among young adults.
I think graduate students are a lonely bunch, doing research alone. It's a lonely occupation and also there isn't really much time to socialize, to go out to dinner. There's no money for going out. And, in a natural way, because these people meet while in the classroom where their cwn children are, there's so much they have in common over the children and in keeping the center going, having work days, and working with their hands to really keep the outdoor equipment in good shape, and sharing this kind of doing something together. It's a tremendous psychological support. And I've talked to women who went to Stanford thirty years ago. We've had letters from people who were on the staff twenty five, thirty years ago, who had children, who had to keep it secret and who had to make do with what they did with their children because they were afraid that the university would knew they had children and they might miss a day because the child was sick, and they say it's wonderful what you're doing. You don't knew hew it was in our day when we couldn't even admit we had children. That change is just phenomenal and I think that's something Stanford can be proud of. And I think it is also something that's incredibly important in keeping the sanity of graduate students and of young professional women because as I see it in Escondido Village, it's a stressful period in life, and having this kind of support both with their cwn peers and in the day care hemes, just having the resource center to talk about their problems, it's a tremendous support structure, which sort of grew up alongside of child care. And you hardly ever hear of

65

Webb:

It's important to mention. I'm glad you did. Is there

anything else you'd like to talk about or emphasize?

Almond:

Well, one concern I have, and I think I mentioned this once

before, is as we build more child care, especially as we build

more structures, it gets more and more expensive, and there will

have to come a time when Stanford has to change from facilitating

child care to supporting child care, supporting in a more direct

way.

Webb:

What kind of financial support does Stanford give to child

care right new?

Almond:

It doesn't really give any. And we're kind of almost

embarrassed when it comes to the National Coalition for Campus

Child Care, where we have sung the praises of Stanford and have

pointed out hew much we have. Then they ask us what our fees are

and they faint, because they're so high. And it means that it

excludes an awful lot of people.

Webb:

Do the other institutions, the other campuses provide

financial support?

Almond:

All the public institutions do. All the larger ones do

because they can have a student assessment, which can be fifty

cents or a dollar a semester that amounts to $40,000 a year for

operating funds. Ihat's one source of support. It very much

depends on the attitude of the administration. It's coming

everywhere, and it's difficult everywhere.

And another thing that I find somewhat troublesome. We talk

about quality child care and we do have quality child care, but

we're working in an environment which is not really interested in

child care. That's not one of the university's interest or

Almond: who work in the Children's Center, the parents, have picked this

up, and these standards are maintained. But I think if scmebody

would say "Well new let's do a totally different system. Let's

take in all the janitor's children, and all the bottle-washers',

and just put more children into each rocm and pay the staff

less," I don't think it would trouble people terribly at

Stanford. I may be exaggerating and think people have been

trained up quite a bit.

Webb:

So you think the climate may be right now?

Almond:

Well, the climate...I wonder. You know, when Ehyllis and I

leave and we don't see to it that classes remain small, salaries

of the day care teachers remain high. There have been times when

people have said: "Why? Why not give more child care and charge

less and come dewn in your standards?"

Webb:

Are you grooming anyone to be a successor?

Almond:

Well, there are a lot of people in the pipeline. Once our

jobs become available I think there'll have to be a national

search. We can't personally say we'd like so-and-so to take our

job.

Webb:

Do you have a definite time in mind to leave the program?

Almond:

Well, Ehyllis would like to stop when that new center is

safely launched. This isn't quite definite whether it's

September '88 or somewhat later, and, since we share a job, we'll

probably have to resign at the same time. That's sort of our

time frame right new.

Webb:

And what comes next? What will you do after that?

Almond:

Well, that's a good question. I'm considering going on the

board of the National Coalition for Campus Child Care, which

would be somewhat of a time consuming activity.

Webb:

What would that involve?

Almond:

Well, it would involve.. .they have an annual conference and

papers are submitted to the conference and they have to be read

and evaluated. That's one aspect. Then there's a lot of

legislation in the works, and what can be actively supporting

national and state legislation pertaining to children. But

somewhere I would like to do exactly the opposite and do some

child or parent counseling. I don't knew if, having not done it

for so long, I could get back into that new.

Webb:

Well, what kinds of commitments would you want to make?

Would you want to have a full schedule or would you want to have

free time for gardening and traveling?

Almond:

I think the time has ccme when I have to be more free for

traveling. That's becoming increasingly difficult since my

husband is retired and does a great deal of talking and meeting

away from here. It's almost necessary that I'm more available.

Webb:

Would you like to travel? In addition to accompanying him

on professional trips?

Almond:

Personally, I would like to get to knew California. It's

always been my dream. I always say to my husband. He goes as

far as the San Francisco Airport and then he takes off., for

either points East or Europe or somewhere. We've never really

traveled in California.

Webb:

Do you ever travel back to Germany?

Almond:

Well, I was last back in Germany in '83, and that was a very

interesting reunion with all my classmates.

Do you want to talk about that a little? Well, it was the fiftieth reunion of the graduating class of '33, and it was a very poignant experience. There had been three Jewish girls in this class and we had of course all been dispersed, and one woman went to England and Eva and I went to the united States, and the one in England wasn't going to come back. She had never been back to Germany. Her father and sister had perished in the holocaust and she really didn't want to come back. And we wrote from here urging her to come, and the German contingent wrote and she finally agreed to come for twenty four hours. She's a psychotherapist in London. She said she couldn't leave her patients longer than that. And so she came and everybody just. · .she was the most popular person at that meeting. Not because she almost didn't come, but she had a certain quality of the psychotherapist and everybody told her their life stories. It was fascinating to see, and of course a lot was done about the three of us. I mean, everybody in Germany feels guilty about what has happenned. We were the invited guests of everybody else. I mean, they wouldn't let us pay our hotel bill or our restaurant meed. It was quite something. And when this woman left for England we all took her to the airport. It was like a high school class going on the bus together.
And hew many were there in the whole group? Well, when we graduated we were, I think, twenty three. And there were fifteen at the reunion. So it was a snail enough group so you got to pretty soon knew, you had fifty years of catching up to do. Very interesting. The interesting thing was that I could almost swear that none of them had been Nazis in that

group. I think the classical education really stuck. You knew,

the very democratic, Grecian tradition, the Greek tradition of

Plato was stronger than the Nazi influence. These were people

who really suffered during those years.

Webb:

Do you have plans for keeping in touch with them or getting

together again?

Almond:

Not at the moment.

Webb:

Have any of them ever ccsne ever here?

Almond:

One person was going to come and they had a mishap

unfortunately in the Los Angeles Airport. Her husband's

briefcase was stolen. They were on a business trip, and with all

of their reservations and tickets, and they were so chagrined and

so shocked they took off and left and went back to Germany. That

was too bad, and she has since died of cancer so that was the end

of that. And I don't knew. I mean, some of icy other German

friends have been here, especially from one family with whom we

were very close. Three members of that family have been here.

Webb:

WOuld you like to do any writing during your retirement?

Almond:

Maybe. I have a hard time writing. I think that's

something that if you haven't done continuously it's very hard to

pick up.

Webb:

What kind of retirement activities occupy your husband?

Almond:

Oh, he is writing and doing research more than ever. He has

written I don't knew hew many major papers just in the last

year. He has taught at Irvine. He taught a very intensive

seminar last quarter at Irvine.

Webb:

Did he ccmmute down there?

Almond:

He taught every other week and he spent Thursday-Friday in

Irvine. It was almost like a commute. He went down five

different times, and had three-hour seminars, a very strenuous

business.

Webb:

How have you adjusted to his retirement?

Almond:

Well, it's interesting. I'm not used to having somebody

heme all the time. And he uses his office less and less at

Stanford because his computer is here. I feel almost guilty when

I'm in my office and come home late and have to call and say:

"Will you please put on the chicken? I'll be late for supper."

I feel I'm having a latchkey husband.

Webb:

Is he a cook?

Almond:

Yes, he's a great cook. He has a vegetable garden which is

his pride and joy, and especially now, he can make ratatouille

out of all his vegetables. And he makes applesauce and he makes

apricot jam and he has certain things which he does with great

pleasure.

Webb:

Oh, that's wonderful. Would you like to talk about any

friendships that you've maintained from different times in your

life. You did mention some of them. Are there any others you'd

like to mention, any names?

Almond:

Well, over the years we've been very good friends with Alex

and Julia George, a remarkable couple, and I think I recommended

that you interview Julie George as a very interesting faculty

wife. We have friends at the university of Wisconsin. I think he

was Gabriel's first graduate student, Bernie Cohen in political

science there, although he's now became more and more.. .he was

provost and is acting president at the moment. So they're very

busy. We don't see them much. There's Lucien and Mary "Pye (sp?)

at MIT, also In political science. He's a China specialist, Asian specialist primarily. And then Marvin and Leah Chflplarcw (sp?) are very good friends here. They're the people in physics.
Do you mean people here or people elsewhere? Anyplace. I'm sure I'm leaving out some key people. This is a very pleasant house that you have, a pleasant view out the windows of your study. Have you always lived in this house since you came to California? Well, the first year when we were at the Center, we lived on the old campus which was wonderful. And, unfortunately we didn't appreciate it at first since I had a kind of stereotyped notion of what living in California would mean. I thought we were going to get a one-story ranch house, but instead we came into an old Victorian, very elaborate house. One wing was closed off but the rest of it was.. .1 had nightmares of spending the year housekeeping in California, but I got away from that quickly and then realized what a wonderful, wonderful location it really was to be right in the middle of the old campus, and my daughter was in first grade then at the old campus elementary school. She became friends with Laurie Hofsteder and the Hofsteders lived just up the street from us on Mirada. They live right next to the president's house. And Nancy and I became very good friends that year. And we're still very good friends with the Hofsteders. When we came back to stay we rented for a year. On campus? No, on Georgia Avenue. We couldn't find anything on campus. My husband went ahead. I was still dissolving our house

in New Haven. But in 1964 we bought this house, which was

incredibly cheap at the tine and less than the houses on campus that were available. And it was just a period when Pine Hill I

had been finished. Pine Hill I or II was finished, I don't knew

which one. Anyway, there were just some very poor lots left and besides, I was getting back to Peninsula Children's Center and didn't have time to build a house, so we looked for a house on

one floor.

Webb:

So was this the California dream house that you had...

Almond:

It almost was, except it didn't have a practical kitchen,

which was included in my dream. And I never did get around to

remodeling our kitchen. It's not a very practical house. It

Webb:

goes off in different directions and you do a lot of running around.
Perhaps you can spend some of your retirement time...

Almond:

Doing all those things, or moving into a smaller house.

Webb: Almond:

Do you think you might do that? I don't knew. I'm torn between opening up this house to

other elderly relatives or friends and making it sort of a senior

retirement home, or moving into a smaller house. I mean, there are several candidates wham I would like to lure here. It would be kind of fun to share a home with. It would be very difficult

to get out of this house. Since my mother died, I have inherited

an incredible amount of very good furniture and I don't knew what to do with it. Antique chests and valuables and...

Webb:

Are ycur children...?

Almond:

Well, my oldest son has a good home. The other two really

don't have the kind of homes which could receive a lot of worldly

goods yet. Maybe someday they will. So it's hard to part

from all these old things which have a lot of associations.

Webb:

Dorothea, we're approaching the end of the interview new.

Is there something you would like to say about the highlights of

your life?

Almond:

I should say that our trip around the world which took a

year must have been one of the high points.

Webb:

When was that?

Almond:

That was '62- '63, just before we came to Stanford.

Webb:

Oh, tell me about it.

Almond:

My husband's work had been involved with the Committee on

Comparative Politics for ten years. And he had sent dozens of

people into the field doing comparative political studies all

over the world. And at the end of that period the Ford Foundation

asked him whether he didn't want to take a look himself, and they

staked him to a year, except that the University of Tokyo got

wind of the fact that he was coming to Japan and they pressed him

to stay for a semester at the University of Tokyo and to teach.

They hadn't had political science there. They had something in

the Law School. But they wanted him to really get political

science started, to teach the teachers of political science that

they had. In the postwar year there really wasn't much. They'd

been trained in Germany before the war and so we spent a

semester. He spent five months. I spent six months and my

daughter spent almost a year in Tokyo, and that became a very

important period in many ways. We had an apartment. We really

lived in Tokyo. It wasn't just a visit.

Ml" I · i

And you were housekeeping in Tokyo? Yes. I was housekeeping, and that's where I met this wonderful person who later came and stayed with us. She was picked by the political science people there in an eight hour interview to be our guardian and housekeeper and translator and everything. It was incredible. We had a four-rocm little apartment. And I didn't knew that for Tokyo that was tremendous housing. This was still Tokyo after the war. I didn't knew how privileged we were to have that. I also didn't knew that I needed a housekeeper and a translator, but I soon learned. It was a fabulous experience. we were invited to the International House for dinner when we first came and it was the first time, since I had to be invited too, that the men brought their wives to any kind of a dinner. The professors at the university of Tokyo had never had dinner with their wives, except in their cwn homes. And they didn't knew hew to seat us. They spent hours in a faculty meeting making the table order. And a very nice couple picked us up at the airport. They were assistant professors. They had been at the University of Chicago where both had gotten a Fh.D. And the wife said to me before this dinner. Don't talk to me at the dinner. I'm not supposed to talk to full professors. That was Tokyo in the early sixties still. But we met many friends there. We've been back to see this young couple. He's now become department chairman. We remained friends. What were some of your other observations about life there? It was hard then for the Japanese. Again, my daughter went to an international school and I became very involved in the

school.

Webb:

Hew old was she then?

Almond:

She was first year junior high school. She was seventh

grade.

Webb:

And your sons were not with you.

Almond:

No. One was at Yale and had just gotten in and he was

getting into his sophomore year and it wasn't a good time to take

him. I wish we had taken him. And the other one was finishing

his medical study, the last year of medical school. In fact, he

got married the year we were in Tokyo. It was terrible. You

knew, at that time you didn't fly back so easily. And they had

to get married because his wife also was in medical school, and

in order to get an internship in the same place they had to be

married or they wouldn't be considered. So they told us before

we left that they probably would be married while we were away.

After Tokyo, I got sick at the end of the Tokyo period and

had to stay an extra month, so I missed Hong Kong and Singapore,

but then we met again in New Delhi, and we spent a couple of

weeks in India and three weeks in Africa, and it was fabulous in

Kenya and Uganda. We were in Kenya when the last British troops

were leaving, when Kenya became independent. And we were in

Uganda just a year after it had become free. And Uganda at that

time was like California a hundred years ago. People were happy

and relaxed and beautiful. This was before Idi Amin and

everything changed. I mean, we just hit the best parts, and also

it was wonderful to be Americans abroad at that time. We were

respected and honored and it was before everything changed. We

just hit a wonderful year. And iry daughter loved it so in Japan

fV'lilli il il

and in that school. She begged us to stay in that school and not go hotel hopping, as she called it, through all these countries with us, which I have regretted terribly too. She missed a wonderful experience. She then joined us in Rome. She flew twenty two hours alone at age twelve around the world while I was traveling in Nairobi and then met in Rome. And then we went back to Germany together and met old friends. So it was a really incredible year, after which I went back to North Haven to give up our home. In the middle of this Gay decided to come to Stanford. This was became Hong Kong and New Delhi that he accepted coming to Stanford, so it was quite a dramatic decision.
