Devaney: Hello. This is Patricia Devaney interviewing Anne Miner as part of the
Stanford Historical Society’s Oral History Program. The date is June 25,
2014, and we are at my home in Palo Alto.
Anne, your life has taken many turns. You started in 1962 at Stanford
as a medical student, dropped out after a year, took a variety of jobs, and
then became involved in the women’s movement. In 1971, Stanford’s
president appointed you to be consultant to the president on affirmative
action for women. A year later, you were hired as Stanford’s first full-time
affirmative action officer, a position you held for six years, when you decided
to go back to school.
This time you became a graduate student in the Stanford business
school, where you earned your PhD in the area of organizational behavior in
1985. Somewhere during that time, you had married, had a child, and
separated from your husband. You then left Stanford to join the faculty in

15

the University of Wisconsin’s business school, where you worked your way
up to become a Distinguished Professor with an endowed chair.
So let’s explore your life and career in this interview with a particular
emphasis on the decade between 1968 and 1978, when you were so
instrumental in increasing the status of women at Stanford. First, let’s start
with your early life. Would you talk about where you grew up and what your
folks did and how many brothers and sisters you had?
Miner: [00:01:34] Sure. I was born in St. Louis, but mostly lived in Evanston,
Illinois. My father was a newspaper editor and reporter, and my mother was
somewhat of a writer, but she was mostly at home. She did spend a time
being executive director of a sorority, which was an important part of her life
and an activity that probably affected me.
I have two older brothers and one is much older, one is a little bit
older.
Devaney: As a little girl, did you have thoughts about what you wanted to become
when you grew up?
Miner: [00:02:17] Well, I used to stand on a post outside our house, or next to it, and
sing, thinking that I would be an opera singer. [laughs] Okay, I don’t know if
I really believed that, but it seemed like a great dream.
Devaney: But you actually still do engage in music, so the dreams of childhood come
true many times.
Miner: [00:02:37] Yes. [laughs]
Devaney: What expectations did your parents have for you? Do you know what their
attitudes were toward your education and your career?

16

Miner: [00:02:46] I have no idea what they thought I should do as a career at all, but
I don’t think they had a strong gender view. I think other people did, but
they didn’t, so they just were sort of neutral.
Devaney: Do you recall what was going on in the external world when you were
growing up that may have influenced your life’s directions? I mean, what
were society’s attitudes toward women’s roles and how they might have
influenced you?
Miner: [00:03:15] Well, the era--to be precise, I was born in 1940, so to me, early
childhood was World War II, and remembering we would be putting things
on the windows because there might be an air attack on Chicago, which
wasn’t very likely, but who knew at the time, right? There was a sense of the
country being under duress.
But around gender, it was pretty simple for me. I mean, the first time
my mother said I could not go out to play after dinner, she said it was
because I was a girl. That led me down a direction that never changed. I
always thought that doesn’t sound right. Now, in retrospect, I realize what
she really meant is, “Because you’re only four years old, you dumb kid.
You’re not going out.” [laughter] But had she had more sense and said,
“Because you’re four,” maybe I’d be a different person.
From the outset, I just never liked sex roles. I never liked anything [that
involved sex role assumptions]. I remember saying I was going to be a doctor
and someone said, “Women can’t be doctors.”
Devaney: Someone, but not your mother?

17

Miner: [00:04:24] No, not my mother. That’s my point. It didn’t come so much from
my family. It was from the society.
Devaney: Where did you go to college?
Miner: [00:04:33] I went to Evanston Township High School, a big high school in
the Midwest that’s very competitive and full of aspiring people.
Devaney: Was that because you lived there?
Miner: [00:04:43] Yes, we all did. Everybody did, and it was a big public high school.
The public education system is what I thought was normal. I never knew
anybody who went to private school.
Then the other kids, who were hardworking and in drama and all these
things that we did, they said, “We should go to Harvard or Radcliffe,”
whatever you want to call it, and four of us went from our class to Radcliffe,
which was a big number.
Devaney: You make it sound like a casual decision, but Radcliffe, in fact, was part of
Harvard. That was a very big deal and a tough school to get in.
Miner: [00:05:20] It was, and it was an aspiration, I have to say. I did apply to
Stanford, I got into Stanford, I almost went to Stanford, but I think because
my friends were going to Boston, I went to Boston.
Devaney: Did you have thoughts by then, when you got there, about what you wanted
to major in?
Miner: [00:05:42] No. I’m one of these people that there are two ways people’s lives
go. Some people, they know they want to be a journalist when they’re ten. I
never knew what I wanted to do, ever, in my entire life. Mine has been all
“do the right next thing.” I mean, I [eventually] had proximate goals where I

18

would go to med school, but I had nothing like that [when I entered college].
I just knew to do what I knew to do. So I was an English major, and I did a
lot of drama and I was on the poetry thing. There was a literary magazine
called The Harvard Advocate. I was a member, writing and publishing poetry,
and acting in plays at the time. It was a very exciting time.
But about my junior year, I thought, “Well, what happened to medical
school?” I thought, “I could do that. I bet I could do that,” and so I
switched, and I went pre-med in my junior year, and I took calculus and
organic chemistry and all these things, which was intriguing. I applied to
medical schools, and I got in.
Devaney: You got into several medical schools?
Miner: [00:06:49] That’s a good question. I don’t remember how many, and at that
time it was an enterprise, because we were told one of the prestigious schools
had a quota. They had a hundred students and a quota of two women. There
was nothing hidden about it. It was an overt system of gender slotting, and
medical schools did not want women. It was Johns Hopkins, maybe, that
publicly stated, “We’ll admit two women.”
Devaney: Did Stanford have quotas for women?
Miner: [00:07:19] I read something recently and it looked like they maybe did, but
the big thing was they had five out of sixty, which was considered radically
huge. Progressive for the era.
Devaney: Come back to that decision to be a pre-med. First, as a little girl, you
probably thought you would be a singer. In college you were into poetry.

19

What was the change that made you decide midway through college that you
might want to be a doctor?
Miner: [00:07:48] It was more like I thought I always had wanted to be a doctor, but
that I hadn’t had quite the courage or spunk to actually do it. That was sort
of my thought, that I could do this. It was similar to when I got my PhD-actually a similar transition. Then I talked to all these people, and actually
many people I knew, including men I knew, said, “If that’s what you want to
do, you should do it.” So I did it.
Devaney: To what extent do you credit Harvard for having encouraged you to do this?
Miner: [00:08:21] Boy, that’s an interesting question. The whole culture, even though
we went to Harvard classes--and we were, in all senses that way, Harvard
students--there was a whole thing about the role of women that penetrated
life. In fact, before I got there, women were not allowed in the undergraduate
library. The graduate students were actually Harvard students, but there were
these remnants of Harvard College. Somebody had to get that fixed. I think
that was fixed by the time I got there, but there was [some] culture of
“women matter,” and there certainly was a culture at Radcliffe that we were
supposed to be strong.
Devaney: Would you back up a little bit and explain a more about what the relationship
was between Harvard and Radcliffe?
Miner: [00:09:09] That’s a good question. There never was any Radcliffe faculty or
anything in the world. They hired Harvard faculty to come teach the
Radcliffe students in the early 1900s, and somewhere long before I was there,
they just got rid of all of that, and Radcliffe would admit people. It was a

20

weird system. But once they were admitted, it was all Harvard classes, all the
faculty were Harvard. It was a coeducational institution, but not the dorms.
Devaney: So Radcliffe was really just an administrative arm of Harvard to host women
students.
Miner: [00:09:41] They had, if you remember--was it Mary [Polly] Bunting who was
the president? She was an interesting type of feminist at the time, a very
strong feminist, and she had a vision that there was a special role for women,
but Radcliffe needed to be standing up for women. In that sense, you were
encouraged to take any aspirations, strong culture. You know, Radcliffe
women are going to achieve things, but you’re going to achieve things with
your special role as a woman. They would have special programs for women
to come back, and the focus was on how you were going to be an educator
of children. So it was a mixed message.
Devaney: Did you see yourself as a feminist in college?
Miner: [00:10:21] I don’t know that we even used the word “feminist” then at all. I
don’t remember when The Second Sex and Betty Friedan’s material was. But
for me personally, as I said, I never thought the world made any sense in
terms of sex roles. I thought they were crazy and stupid. Even when I was a
camp counselor in college, we had canoe trips--typically nine people, six kids,
three grownups--and there had never been a woman who had been the head
counselor on a canoe trip in charge of the canoes. I said, “That doesn’t make
any sense,” and so I led canoe trips. It was like little micro things, and I just
never saw it. But I never was confrontational. I just said, “Wouldn’t that be

21

fun?” [Basically I saw the world through feminist values since childhood but
in that era, sexism was the norm.]
Devaney: You didn’t get pushback then?
Miner: [00:11:14] No.
Devaney: So you came to Stanford for whatever reasons as a medical student in 1972.
How many women were in your class, did you say?
Miner: [00:11:24] Five out of sixty.
Devaney: How were the women treated by either their male colleagues or by the
faculty?
Miner: [00:11:32] I have a hard time answering that clearly. Sexism was so much part
of the general culture, you kind of had to go out of your way to notice it,
right? So were there sexists? Of course. I shouldn’t even go into it, but there
was one guy in one department who was just crazily sexist. I don’t mean
harassing. But in the culture of the time, they were trying not to be sexist, let
me put it that way, and they meant for the women to succeed. It was a waste
of money if they didn’t, so they meant for it to work, and there were some
very successful women students.
Devaney: You stayed one year. Why did you decide to drop out?
Miner: [00:12:19] I did not do real well in the anatomy class, and they said to me,
“We’re not going to kick you out, but we’re going to make you take that class
again.”
And I thought, “Really.” [laughter] So I said, “Why don’t I take a leave
of absence?” And they said, “That’s a good idea.”

22

I took a leave of absence, and the longer I was out of the medical
school, the happier I was. I took that as a sign that I shouldn’t be in medical
school. I know we don’t want to spend too much on it, but I have to tell you,
to this day when I drive by our huge hospital at UW, University of
Wisconsin--which is like here, it’s this medical world--I think, “Thank you,
higher power, for not letting me continue medical school,” because I just
think I would have been unhappy going every day to work with sick people. I
mean, I like sick people. We’re all sick people. [laughs] But I’m so grateful I
didn’t do that. I was connected mostly to the psychiatry department, and
maybe I would have done that. But I’m glad I didn’t do that.
Devaney: What did you do after you dropped out of medical school?
Miner: [00:13:24] That’s a good period that’s probably not too salient to this project,
but I went to Europe. I just kind of came back across the U.S., couldn’t
decide what to do, and I finally decided to come back to Palo Alto. I spent
quite a bit of time, which is relevant to what we’re talking about today, as a
Western girl--you know, temporary typist--so I’d be typing at NASA,
Hewlett-Packard, maybe Fairchild. I don’t remember. But all those big
companies around here--General Electric, I think--gave me a fascinating tour
of organizations. But one of the assignments was in Encina Hall, where Bob
Freelen was--Encina Hall at Stanford where the Development Office was,
which, of course, I’d never heard of. I didn’t know Development existed,
actually. But I went there, and this man’s secretary was gone. Actually, before
that, they gave me this list of names to alphabetize. That was the Buck Club,
which was Stanford’s male scholarship for athletes, a very happy thing. But

23

that meant I knew these people in that office and I worked for this guy, Bob
Freelen, who was a very fun and interesting man. He was the director of the
Annual Fund for the development office.
The role of the Development Office was to raise funds for the
university. It’s a huge staff, huge operation with lots of people. So all that
happened then, just to wrap this up. Because I worked there, I met those
people [other people than development staff] and I did some help. They had
a journal and a publication, [probably Per/Se published starting 1966] and I
probably helped fold things for that.
But then after that, some medical school friends asked me to work with
a small company that sold information services, an entrepreneur. I’ve always
been mystified why they asked me to do that, but they did, and I became the
executive vice president for operations of TOLOS Associates. It’s now long
defunct, but that had a huge effect on my life in the sense that I was an
administrator, and I went and took a small business course to learn how the
world works. I had no clue until that point how the corner drugstore ran, so
to speak. [I knew nothing of the everyday way commerce and regular
institutions work.] It [TOLOS Associates] was educational, and it had some
Stanford links, because there were Stanford professors involved in advising
this little company. But eventually the company went under. The founder just
one day didn’t come to work. [laughs] That’s pretty much it.
Devaney: How long did you work at TOLOS?

24

Miner: [00:16:24] I don’t remember. A while, a year and a half, and enough that I
borrowed money from people to invest in it, etcetera. It’s a classic startup
story, except that it’s one of the 90 percent of startups that failed.
But at that point then, Bob Freelen was sitting in the Development
Office at Stanford, and we sort of were vaguely in touch. He had some
problem with coordinating his mail-appeal programs, mailing out mailings.
Devaney: He knew you because you had worked there as a temporary before you went
to be executive director at TOLOS.
Miner: [00:16:54] Precisely the point. Yes.
Now, since we’re on the gender thing, it’s important, I think, to notice
that that was a classic gender role thing. I was doing one thing that young
women could do. That [temp secretarial work] and waitressing were the two
things I could always earn money doing, and that’s because I was a typist.
One time at NASA--this is going to be a vanity story--but I was typing
a document, and I asked one of the people I was typing for, “Well, what does
this part of the satellite do there?”
And the man said, “What? Can you understand the point about the
satellite that you’re typing about?” Then I realized that was a no-no. I was
supposed to be a mindless person who had no clue what I was typing. It was
a gender role that assumed you were not processing; you were just doing the
typing.
So the Stanford Annual Fund Program needed someone. According to
them, they needed somebody who would help with these mail-appeal things,
and they offered me a job, and it was Bob Freelen. Either that one or the

25

next job, I remember it clearly, I was making $7,000 a year, and they offered
me $10,000 a year. That was 1967.
Devaney: That was good money in 1967.
Miner: [00:18:11] That’s what I thought. I said, “You have to be kidding.” Nobody
ever gave me that kind of money in my whole life. That made it attractive, so
I went.
Devaney: What did you do in the Development Office?
Miner: [00:18:23] I had a little cubby, and I did hundreds and hundreds of thousands
of mailing pieces to alumni. It was my job to make sure they all went out. But
within maybe a half year--I’m not sure how long, not too long--a
[professional job] opening came. [In the mail appeal job] I was not a
professional. All the professionals [were] males in these offices around a big
bullpen in the middle where all the women were, and I was sort of in a cubby
halfway between. In terms of the [unspoken] rules of the office, I went to
coffee with the women because I was a woman and because I was doing a
job that wasn’t a professional job with the big offices around the outside.
But then I got promoted into a male job as the director of the mailappeal program. So then I’m talking with all the class agents. It was a
fabulous job, it was incredible, because you met people from the class of
1914, ‘15, ‘16, and I know all those [folks]. They’re all dead now, but they
were so interesting.
Devaney: So you were the first woman to have what had been a man’s job at that time.
Miner: [00:19:36] Yes, and it [was] also beginning to feel kind of my life as Joan of
Arc. It also involved going out to, like, El Centro or Bakersfield and taking

26

kits to the alumni, representing the university, talking about sports and so on.
They had never had a woman field fundraiser before, so Freelen got a lot of
heat for that. They said, “You can’t do that.” I remember at the time that I
was grateful that he was willing to go argue with people, that they should
have a woman field fundraiser, because I didn’t feel I had the courage to do
that. Later I would have, but I didn’t then.
Devaney: How many years did you work in the Development Office total?
Miner: [00:20:20] Four.
Devaney: During this time, what was happening in the external world with respect to
civil rights? This was what year now or what era?
Miner: [00:20:28] 1967, 1968.
Devaney: So all hell was breaking loose on American campuses all over, civil rights
movement. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in 1968. The women’s
movement, gay rights, I mean, it’s all kind of coming together. What, in fact,
was happening at Stanford around these issues then?
Miner: [00:20:46] Great question, and I think this is a cliché. A lot of people believe
this, but I do believe that the complete sense of everything boiling up
influenced the willingness of women to think there might be a women’s
issue. In my experience, in my [field fundraiser] job, I’m writing memos every
day to Stanford alumni about the students’ demonstrations or constantly
translating to alums what is happening up here, because they were angry.
Devaney: They were angry about student demonstrations.

27

Miner: [00:21:18] Of course they were, and so we were kind of the translators. That
was part of my role, and I’d go to demonstrations with my dog and report
back.
In addition, there was the women’s liberation movement happening by
that name, where there was an explicit agenda of consciousness-raising. It
wasn’t the straight economic equal pay issue. It was something more
fundamental. I remember some of the radical women, the famous saying
about the place for women--I can’t remember, it’s a famous radical student
group. “The place for women in the movement is prone,” or on their backs.
Those were the sayings [about political, ethnic social movement groups at the
time].
There were all these politically radical people since 1962, so I said,
“Wait a minute. Wait a minute.” I was in a women’s liberation group that was
local here in Palo Alto, and at that point, what strikes me looking back, is I
had been socialized by the Annual Fund, by the Stanford Development
Office ways of doing things, that I just would replicate in this women’s lib
world--I would produce the roster of all the attendees on Monday night
group the second night [the same as] what I would do in the Development
Office.
Devaney: Wait, wait. Yes, but at the time, the women’s movement initially was more
awareness-raising among women.
Miner: [00:22:35] It was everything, but that was part of it.
Devaney: Part of your role at a personal level, not a professional level, was to bring
women together and to sort of organize some of their activities?

28

Miner: [00:22:48] Well, self-select. I mean, it was a social movement, and I was in it,
and I was like these other people. But I just went looking in my old files, and
I noticed that I would then voluntarily say, “Well, I will make the list. I will
produce a roster.” I didn’t type the roster. My secretary over in the
fundraising office typed the roster of the women’s group. So I was involved,
and I was kind of a quasi-organizer.
Devaney: This was totally unrelated to your job in the development office.
Miner: [00:23:15] Absolutely.
Devaney: But that was okay with them that they had your secretary typing up your-Miner: [00:23:19] Looking back, if I were going to interview those people, I’d say,
“Why did you let that happen?” Because looking back, we did things like
make speeches at the Kiwanis Club about what is women’s liberation. But
this was something that was laughed at. It wasn’t only despised; it was
laughed at. So there was a lot of anger about the women’s movement.
Devaney: Say more about what you mean by the women’s movement.
Miner: [00:23:57] It is interesting, because it wasn’t a top-down movement, it was a
bottom-up movement where many people spontaneously said something,
and clearly it was partly triggered--and a lot of people said this--by the black
liberation movement where people would say, “You shouldn’t call me a boy
when I’m a grown man.” So a woman would sit there and say, “Well, wait a
minute. So why am I called a girl?” Many of the things that the women’s
movement did were clearly imitative or learning from the other social
movements going on. That was happening here at Stanford.

29

Devaney: I was curious about what women’s liberation was and how it was expressing
itself at Stanford. You said that you were not only part of some of these
spontaneous groups, but that you helped organize them.
Miner: [00:24:46] Yes. And since I didn’t get into trouble doing that, I went on
doing it on the campus. Some of the people were the same people. If you
look at those rosters, some of the people appear much later in stories as
sometimes more radical women on the campus.1
But at that time, I wasn’t mindful of that, so I went around on campus,
and I don’t know why exactly I did this, but I went to the meetings--there
were all these same spontaneous things happening in the YWCA, the
Stanford Distaff Club, which was women faculty and women staff, the
Stanford Faculty Women’s Club, which was [then] comprised of faculty
wives [founded in 1896]. That’s what it was. For some reason I got into
helping all those people.
Devaney: At some point you met and worked a little bit with the wife of the Stanford
president, Jing Lyman. Is that right?
Miner: [00:25:43] I did. It was sort of like people milling around doing things, right?
Then you’d run into each other. The Stanford wives, Women’s Club, I think,
wanted to do something about the employment of women. They wanted to
get out of this sort of tea-party-only role. So it was, again, a sex role question.
I said, [interpreted this as] “No, we’re not just little ladies. We’re doing stuff.”

[Anne Miner’s note] I am referring to Glenda Jones who would attend women’s lib group meetings in Palo
Alto--this is somewhat later but also was a major force in the union and SLAC with a Marxist viewpoint of
class warfare.
1

30

And in fact they were. [So they did] and I helped them.2 I believe I helped
them with a pamphlet they did called Going Into Labor--I think I helped with
the design of the pamphlet or the writing or something.
Devaney: That was something Mrs. Lyman was involved with?
Miner: [00:26:16] She was a force.
Devaney: Was she a feminist?
Miner: [00:26:21] I don’t like to use that word, to describe someone else’s agenda
but she was an activist around these women’s questions, absolutely.
Devaney: Why don’t you like to use the word “feminist”?
Miner: [00:26:29] Why don’t I? To describe someone else’s activities? I think it was
used to connote things to some people that I don’t think are particularly
useful. , But I’m a feminist certainly in the fundamental sense, that I think we
should change sex roles and women should have a different situation, but so
should men. But, yes, my caution maybe comes from that era when that
word “feminist” often was used in a pejorative way or to mean that you’re
some kind of crazy, as they said, another bra-burning woman. But if you had
to generally say that a feminist means someone who assumes that sex roles
are not good--that there’s something bad about that, and that women in

[Anne Miner’s note] It is important to clarify that they were already doing all this. I just helped. They were
already very active in wanting to create new programs for the women who had set aside their careers for family
but were interested in re-entry into workforce or education.
3. [Anne Miner’s note] In a way there were two ‘flavors’ of activism at that time. In one flavor, the goal was a
society where men and women could develop their potential equally in all areas--as when women became
doctors or full professors without it being a surprise. It would end socially constructed sex roles. In the second
flavor, women kept a distinct role in the family and perhaps in social welfare, but this distinct role was honored
and supported by society (as in special courses for returning full time mothers). I am a feminist of the first type,
but have always respected the second vision. To some degree, we are still working out as a society what mix
seems best. I always felt we should start with the default of full equal opportunity, and experiment for a half
century or so.
2

31

particular need to have different roles, more opportunities--sure, of course.
We should probably encourage its use to help overcome the old stereotype.
Devaney: Given the period, it’s interesting that the wife of the Stanford president
would have been such a presence herself on these issues. Is that how you
came to the attention of Stanford’s president in 1971, Richard Lyman, when
he asked you to become a consultant to him on affirmative action for
women? How did you come to his attention?
Miner: [00:27:45] Who knows, really? I wasn’t there in some private conversation,
but I don’t know how much it was that. Also by then, in 1969, I’m going
around doing names and meeting all these people. I’m going around the
campus, meeting with the professional women of the Stanford medical
school, where they had a big issue, and I said, “Oh, well, maybe you could do
these things.” I always was in this kind of staff role. I said, “Well, here are
eight things you could do if you want. How about childcare? How about
salary equity?” I was like a little Janice Appleseed going around and
suggesting we do things about it with many other people. I was by no means
the only person. I was just one of the movement, but I did do one thing
which brought me to the attention of the president. There were so many
people at that time--and this was a big point we’ll get to later--you could
know everyone on the campus who was willing to care about women,
because it was very risky. Women who did that were often shamed or were
made fun of by their male colleagues.
There were women students one time that wanted to do a survey of the
staff of secretaries, whom I knew a lot because I really was one in many

32

ways, and they assumed that if you’d given a survey to the Stanford
secretaries, they were going to hear, “We should rise up and take over.”
I said, “Don’t do that, because I can tell you that’s not what you’re
going to get. You’re going to get people who are going to say, ‘It all seems
fine to me,’” because they were acculturated to being safe and nobody
wanted to speak out much. Some people did. I knew all this.
The point of the story, though, is that I then created an organization
called the Women’s Forum, and it was a name, and it invited all the groups.
We had, I think, eighteen groups at one point, and we would meet and we
would discuss issues. That also included Judy Poole, who was a medical
school researcher who eventually was to become a full professor, but she was
an advocate and a very powerful person; Jing Lyman; Joyce Kobayashi, who
was one of the student presidents; and Marg Lozoff from the Human
Problems Institute. And that was visible to the president because he knew
what we were doing and we would copy him [on some reports]. Also when
you work in the Development Office, you staff events that the president
hosts, so I knew him because we were doing alumni events over in the
Faculty Club, where I was the person with the nametags and providing staff
support. I met him all the time that way, because that was our job.
Devaney: Were you surprised when he approached you in January of 1971 to be a
consultant to him on affirmative action for women?
Miner: [00:30:43] Somewhat, but the key is, the most visible thing we did, was there
was a great example of how organizations work, that Joyce Kobayashi, the
student president, happened to be on the Committee on Committees, the

33

[Faculty Senate’s] organizing committee. She said, “Hey, maybe we could get
a Committee on the Education and Employment of Women in the formal
system,” because all this is out of the university system, right? We’re all
volunteers running around the periphery.
Devaney: You’re doing ad hoc groups.
Miner: [00:31:14] We [were]. Nobody has any power of any sort. So that was a
serendipitous moment, and we said, “What a great idea.” And Jing Lyman
was for that, other people were for it.
Devaney: This is to create something called the Women’s Forum?
Miner: [00:31:31] No, we had the Forum. I already had the Forum. I did that.
Devaney: It brought together these eighteen different separate groups of women
working on women’s issues. You then wanted to institutionalize it within the
university. And who had to okay that?
Miner: [00:31:44] Well, it had to go to the Faculty Senate. So we, in a two-month
period, wrote the documents. I wrote the charge to the committee. We wrote
all this stuff. Then the student--it’s a fabulous story--she was on the
committee, she took it to them.
Devaney: This is Joyce, the president of the student body?
Miner: [00:32:00] Yes. And they passed it. This would have been the end of that
summer. She was a smart and really gracious person. And totally to our
astonishment, they said, “Fine,” this Committee on Committees. So they
took it to the Faculty Senate, the governance body of the Academic Council.
So in October of 1970, because spring of ’70 we did the forum, then
this all came up, and we said, “Great.” We thought, “We’ll just solve this

34

whole thing by having this committee created, something that has real power
and authority,” and went to the Senate. I went to that meeting.
The president, who was then provost, I believe, said, “Maybe we
should have a committee, but we have too many committees, and it should
be temporary,” because I remember that was a big issue for us.
And we said, “No, no, this is going to go on a long time, not
temporary.” And maybe this is my Joan of Arc saying it, I think I remember
arguing that point, but someone, and our group, did lots of lobbying with the
Faculty Senate and their spouses. The faculty made it a standing committee.
Lyman knew me. In that sense he knew me.
Devaney: So you had organized this Women’s Forum of all these disparate groups on
campus, you and the Stanford student body president and some other people
took it to the Academic Senate, which was the governing body for all
academic policies at Stanford and proposed that the Women’s Forum be part
of the university.
Miner: [00:33:52] No, the Committee on the Education and Employment of
Women. And actually, technically, of course, we didn’t do that. The
Committee on Committees was proposing a whole bunch of committee
reorganizations, and our committee was part of it.
Devaney: So you had to get it through, first, this committee, which was presumably
primarily a faculty committee, and then it went to the Senate as a whole.
Miner: [00:34:18] Well, they had a student [member of the advisory group]. But it
was disputed. I had one faculty wife, if you want to talk about these sort of
off-the-record non-obvious stories. It looked kind of smooth, right, and we

35

had all those organizations listed as being part of it. But I had a call from one
faculty wife saying, “Anne, you’ve got to stop this. It’s outrageous. Don’t do
this. They’re going to hate us. This is too much. The men faculty are going to
[be angry and it will be our fault]. There will be a big backlash, because you’re
being too pushy.” -- [laughs]
Devaney: What was the charge to the Committee on the Education and Employment
of Women?
Miner: [00:34:54] It was a long list. I said, “It’s going to study the educational
opportunities. It’s going to consider whether opportunities are equal for men
and women.” It was definitely non-confrontational language, but it was
explicitly saying, “There’s something serious and fundamental about women
that the university should do something about.” She felt that to even make
that strong a view was enraging to the men or whoever had power.
Devaney: Was it passed easily or was it a big argument in the Senate?
Miner: [00:35:30] That’s a pattern that we’ll see. We can’t do it all day, but it
happened many times. I don’t think there was a lot of argument, but I think
there was some, and there was certainly some that sided with Lyman on
giving temporary status.
But it’s a pattern that occurred in the medical school too. I think what
would happen--I’m just guessing here--is that the women’s liberation
movement had gotten far enough that people didn’t really want to publicly
trash women. Even if they didn’t like it, they weren’t going to stand up and
say, “I’m against the Committee on Women.” But did they care? There was a

36

passive support, I’m happy to say, but I don’t know if you could poll their
brains on what they were thinking.
Devaney: Were you already a consultant to the president when the proposed
Committee on the Education and Employment of Women was-Miner: [00:36:19] No, we did that before. Long before.
Devaney: So by this time, the president knew perfectly well who you were.
Miner: [00:36:23] It’s hard to say. I was a visible proactive person.
Devaney: So he asked you if you would then become a consultant to him on
affirmative action for women. What does the term “affirmative action”
mean?
Miner: [00:36:37] That’s a great question. Of course, it’s a big social issue, how
people interpret it, and it’s a subject of sustained controversy to this day.
What does it mean? What should it mean? Conceptually, the biggest feature
about that phrase is that--and Lyman did write a good thing about this too.
There’s this concept that if you’ve had past discrimination against a group,
any group, that’s considered wrong. And you say, “Oh, that was the wrong
thing and we don’t like that.” But it’s not enough to say, “We’re going to
stop this.” This concept of affirmative action says that once that happens,
you have to do two things. One is you have to take affirmative steps to
ensure that further discrimination does not occur. You have to actually do
something to show that. And second, you need to take steps--and this is
where all the controversy comes--to “remedy the present effects of past
discrimination.” That’s where the wars come.

37

Devaney: Does this meaning of “affirmative action” apply at a few places like Stanford,
or more generally, with respect to past effects of discrimination against
women faculty?
Miner: [00:37:53] The concept, as you know, was actually designed and had nothing
to do with women, and it was very controversial to apply it to women. It was
designed around black employment. It was designed by the Department of
Labor to deal with labor unions. They had spent thirty years with statements
saying, “We won’t discriminate,” but nothing happened. So they said, “You
have to do better, and you have to do something affirmative to change this
bad pattern.”
[00:38:23] To recruit more blacks, and to not use illegal standards--the
whole idea of standards that has an adverse impact and that you have to
prove that you should use it.
It was well worked out in labor law, and it was around minorities. What
was going on in the very time we’re talking about was adding women into
that machinery around “what does it mean to do this.” The biggest question
was that whole system wasn’t designed for universities, and all of a sudden
the concepts were being applied there.
Devaney: At some point, the U.S. government did pass regulations requiring
employers, large employers who had federal contracts, to take affirmative
action to hire and pay women and minorities who are underrepresented in
the workplace.
Miner: [00:39:19] Let’s get that straight. In 1968, an executive order was issued by
Johnson about employment discrimination. And it’s not a law; it’s an order

38

by the federal government for federal contractors only. So if we had been
willing to give up our federal contracts, we didn’t have to do any of this
legally. That executive order went on kind of morphing, and they added
women in 1970 in the external world. They added goals and timetables for
women in 1971.
This is all the Department of Labor. Then in March 1972, another
hidden wrinkle was that professional women had been exempted from
something that is a law, Title VII. Title VII says you will not discriminate by
race or sex, but they had exempted professional women for some reason.
Professional women were not included at that time. So in ’72, they added
them in. That’s also when they did Title IX [requirements on gender equity
for students].
[00:40:41] It wasn’t until 1972 that the Department of Labor gave it to
Health, Education and Welfare as the oversight group for universities. That’s
the first time universities really became involved in it, when it might touch
faculty or professionals. They [HEW] were delegated [enforcement
responsibility by DOL]. The Department of Labor tells Health, Education
and Welfare, “You are the enforcers,” and so they were scrambling trying to
write these regulations, and they did, but they were developing them all that
time.
Devaney: In the middle of all of this kind of federal frenzy, you were appointed by
Lyman to be his consultant on affirmative action for women, and I saw from
a document that your charge from President Lyman was, and I quote, “to
carry on a special study and analysis of the employment of women in the

39

university, review the status of women at all levels of employment, study
current university policies and procedures applicable to this matter, and
provide recommendations for policy changes needed to achieve the
elimination of sex discrimination in employment actions.” That is a big
charge. How did you go about that assignment, and what were some of the
major issues you addressed?
Miner: [00:42:05] That was January 1971. I think we should note another thing here.
I had a student who wrote a dissertation on two topics within this area, and
she’s an organization theorist as I am.
Devaney: She’s a recent student?
Miner: [00:42:25] No, this is 1976 and 1977 when she wrote this. It was in the
dissertation archives at Michigan. It’s a published dissertation. She was a
graduate student in the Stanford School of Education, under Jim March. Her
name was Sue Estler.
So she’s noticing this history, the same history, and it’s not the main
focus, this part, but her analysis, which I agreed with but I hadn’t thought
about much, includes the point that there was this turnover in the
governance of the university. So we had President Pitzer there for a couple
years.
Some of these years, I’m saying Dick Lyman was the provost, now who
we think of as President Lyman. He was not the president of the university,
but he was operating as a provost. When that Committee on Women was
approved, I think he was still the provost. I think he was not formally the
president until 1971.

40

Devaney: So Kenneth Pitzer was the president of Stanford when the Committee on
Women was formed and the chief academic officer, the provost, was actually
Richard Lyman.
Miner: [00:43:35] Yes.
Devaney: Then Ken Pitzer left Stanford after two years, and Dick Lyman was
promoted from provost to president in January 1971, and it was at that time,
that he wrote the letter and brought you on board.
Miner: [00:43:53] Yes. As I understand, he was acting president that fall, the fall
when the Committee on Women got created, for example. I was not a
university officer at the time. Lyman had advisors: the chief legal counsel for
him, and Robert Rosenzweig, who was his kind of éminence grise, advisor on
many things, who ended up being the head of External Relations, but he was
an advisor to Lyman all along.
For reasons I don’t remember, I knew those people, and two things
happened. One was that Pitzer didn’t appoint me to the very Committee on
Women that we had formed, which I found stunning. It was a very helpful,
educational lesson for me. I thought we owned all this. But they didn’t pick
us to be on the committee. They picked other people, [although] they picked
good people.
Devaney: What year was the Committee on the Education and Employment of
Women formed?
Miner: [00:45:05] In the fall of 1970.
Devaney: By January of 1971, Pitzer was gone, the president was Dick Lyman.

41

Miner: [00:45:11] But right then is my point. I mean, Lyman’s official start date was
January 1971, and he couldn’t appoint me as a consultant to the president
before then because he wasn’t the president. So I’m just saying this is part of
a general set of actions, I believe, that Lyman took to establish what he
wanted for tone and what kind of a style he wanted as president. So it was
many things he did and who he appointed as provost, and what he did on
other issues, because there were tons of issues.
I think my appointment was just one of several things where he said,
“Here’s this issue. As an important issue, here’s what I think we should do,”
and he knew he had other advisors who were, I think, suggesting this strategy
of having someone do something.
But the simple answer is many people, myself included, believed that
this changed the game in terms of discrimination questions. You could not
go through pre-existing models of how the university should handle
discrimination and just put “and women, and women, and women” under
every little phrase, because there was already a big affirmative action plan.
That was the fundamental issue. It wasn’t going to work to do that.
Lyman and those folks said, “Well, then we need somebody to kind of
go out and look into all this and come back with some things that we could
do that are meaningful that aren’t just taking the federal regulations and
putting in ‘women, and women, and women.’” That basically was the charge.
How would you translate these questions and make them something that the
community would believe in and understand? But it was true, it was nested in
the template of knowing that externally the university would submit some

42

kind of revised [formal affirmative action] plan [to the government], and they
didn’t have any basis for making that plan. So it was a charge to me.
I would say one thing I notice in it now is that there’s nothing in what I
was asked to do then about education, nothing about admissions, recruiting
women, nothing. It was a straight employment study.
Devaney: Your job was focused on employment.
Miner: [00:47:18] It was, and that’s because of the external question. I mean, I think
that is true.
Devaney: What external question? You mean because of external regulations.
Miner: [00:47:24] There were no lawsuits at that point under Title IX, et cetera.
There weren’t lawsuits around educational equity at that time. There were
actual federal contracts held up at Harvard and, I think, Michigan.
My view of that is--later I saw it more clearly, but I think I knew this at
the time--that Stanford, but especially Lyman and those folks, felt that if
there was a social movement that had merit, [important] merit, that the best
thing for Stanford to do was to get it before it crystallized in hostile ways. We
should play a role creating what was the vision and what should this mean,
rather than waiting for people to come get us, and that was a very Lyman-y
approach, and my whole education, so to speak, was around consulting with
others [as a way to get things done.] Fundraising is all consulting. You don’t
have power over anybody, right? You can’t tell volunteers to do anything, so
it’s all built on consulting, having advisors, learning, and that was the style I
brought to the job, and that’s what he wanted me to do, I think.

43

Devaney: Let’s put this in context. In 1971, there were riots at Stanford for the
Vietnam War, there were riots about civil rights, and there were protests
about women. Stanford had sit-ins in the President’s Office protesting the
war. Pitzer quit through all the chaos because he couldn’t handle it. Lyman, a
very gentle history professor who had been provost a short time, came in as
president. He faced not only student riots and sit-ins in the President’s
Office, he was facing questions about one of the faculty members who was
going to be fired for causing a riot. He was dealing with the awareness of all
of the federal legislation and regulations that were being formed.
Miner: [00:49:22] Many of them. This is just one little one.
Devaney: So this one having to do with employment of women, was it possible that he
said, “I’m going to pick the best woman I know, who’s got the broadest
sense, give her a charge, and get on with this, because I’ve got to deal with
the student riots”? Does that make sense to you?
Miner: [00:49:43] Anything’s possible. I don’t know what was inside his head.
Devaney: His legacy is very much about dealing with the student riots.
Miner: [00:49:50] But he was seen as tough on that. He was seen as calling the police
when nobody else would. Actually, he was seen as a very tough guy.
Devaney: But he was seen as a very gentle man who handled it without going through
the Kent State kind of crisis.
Miner: [00:50:03] He didn’t shoot anybody.
Devaney: Right. Nobody got shot, and, in fact, in the final analysis, considering the
intensity of the hostilities, Stanford came through it pretty well.

44

Miner: [00:50:12] I agree, but I think that you’re giving your own interpretation on
whether he was seen as gentle or not. He was actually seen, I think, as very
tough by many people. But I don’t think it’s important, because your
question has to do with what did all that have to do with him appointing this
consultant.
Devaney: It’s the environment in which you came in, is what I’m saying.
Miner: [00:50:32] That is correct. As I say, I think an important thing to know is
actually Stanford did resist some previous federal--I wasn’t there, but I
understand--the previous enforcement of these same guidelines we’re talking
about--affirmative action guidelines.
Devaney: For women?
Miner: [00:50:52] No, they had nothing to do with women until later. Remember, it
didn’t happen until 1970 or 1971 that we were even covered.
Devaney: So Stanford was resisting affirmative action for minorities?
Miner: [00:51:00] It was not resisting doing it, but it was resisting setting formal
faculty numerical goals, and I believe it did resist.
Devaney: Are formal goals the same thing as quotas?
Miner: [00:51:07] No, of course not.
Devaney: What are they? What are formal goals?
Miner: [00:51:10] It’s so great because at that time these were such issues, we would
have public debates about this, does this mean quotas or not. But this is
really not intellectually difficult. They’re completely different. A quota means
that if, for example, we’re hiring and are admitting people to the medical
school--we’ll go back to that--and we’ll have forty-five people admitted or

45

fifty-nine people admitted, we have a quota of five women, then we have to
make the last one a woman to get to our quota.
A goal says, “Well, we think it’s reasonable,” it’s like in fundraising.
“We think it’s reasonable to achieve this goal, and so if we [don’t] get to that
same point, that tells us maybe there’s something we’re doing wrong about
recruiting.” It doesn’t mean you necessarily will do anything to get that
number. It says this is a warning sign, a wakeup call. These goals tell you
aspiration levels or how much do you have, where should you recruit.
Devaney: So goals could be numerical, it’s just that they’re not quotas. They’re just
“hope-that-you-can-get-there” plans.
Miner: [00:52:15] These are like you would do in budgeting or in anything else.
Devaney: Let’s come back to your assignment. What were some of the major issues
you addressed as consultant to the president?
Miner: [00:52:26] The purpose of that job, the assignment, as you said, was to study
the question and to write a report, and that’s what I did.
Devaney: And provide recommendations for policy changes.
Miner: [00:52:38] Yes, so that’s what I did, and I went around and I met with
everybody in personnel and faculty advisors and women. Another thing for
me personally was I didn’t really understand how the university ran--how it
was organized. What power did deans have? How do faculty appointments
occur? What is the medical school doing? What is SLAC? So I had this
fabulous, fun time. It was like being paid to go to the movies, because I
could walk into all these rooms and say, “Hi, I’m working for Dick Lyman.
Tell me about everything at SLAC.” I was not anybody’s enemy, so it was

46

like going to college. It was great, and I had a wonderful time learning all this
stuff.
But I also had views, and I think I showed you that picture today. I like
organizations. I like to think about how you can change things by structure
and policies. So I was thinking all the time, “Well, what could we do that
would matter?” Nationally everybody was doing this, so I was going to
conferences where everybody was trying to think about what to do about
women. There was a huge network of people saying, “We at Harvard, we did
this,” or, “We did that.” I was just like a little Johnny Appleseed in reverse. I
was sucking in different strategies from what you might do.
Devaney: So Stanford wasn’t the pioneer here. We were kind of in a situation where
everybody was at the same time trying to deal with these issues.
Miner: [00:54:19] They were, but to be fair to Stanford, I think it is definitely true
that there were schools that were more adversarial.
[00:54:27] And a famous story--this was told by people explaining why
the federal HEW, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the
auditors, were a problem, because they didn’t understand anything about
universities, which was sort of true--how they were at Harvard and they
threatened the president. They said, “President, you have to give us a list of
all the department heads now. There are faculty issues here.”
Then so the president said, “Well, we could do that, but we don’t
actually have an organization structure written. There’s no organization chart.
Why do you want one?”

47

[According to the story] the auditors said, “Well, we want it because if
they don’t do affirmative action right, you would threaten to fire the faculty
department chairman.” So that makes perfect sense if you’re in an industrial
context, if you say, “I’m going to remove you as the chair of your
department,” that’s a threat to make you do affirmative action in the
university. [But the point of the story was that] most of the faculty would
have said, “Great. I’m so grateful I don’t have to be the department chairman
[any longer].” There’s no aspiration to do that. It’s absolutely true.
Devaney: [laughs] And besides, faculty had tenure, and they couldn’t be fired by HEW.
Miner: [00:55:46] Well, not by the university, but they could be fired as department
chair [by colleagues usually]. Besides, they didn’t have that much power over
their colleagues in some cases.
I tell that as a tale that there was a cultural war going on, and that’s one
that shows [why Department of Labor] eventually went to Health, Education
and Welfare [to develop and enforce affirmative action in higher education].
The theory was they might understand education better. But most of the
people on that side [DOL] were trained in an industrial context.
I want to make this point. Stanford could have been among the
universities that actively resisted. Many did. They wouldn’t give any records
and they would refuse to set goals or that sort of thing. I think it was a
strategic choice for Lyman--we debated this some, for example, around
faculty numerical goals. Could we do that? Could we actually use that
technique of setting goals for how many women faculty or minority faculty
you might expect without it turning into a bloodbath where federal auditors

48

came and held up all our contracts? Lyman is like the President of the United
States, his job is to keep the institution safe, so he was worried about that.
But he made some choice, and I think he was heavily influenced by Robert
Rosenzweig and Jim Siena and probably his wife and other people whom I
don’t know, and probably Bill Miller on that issue.
Devaney: Let’s go back. Rosenzweig was an advisor to the president, Siena was the
university lawyer, and when Dick Lyman became president, he appointed
William Miller as his provost.
Miner: [00:57:20] That’s right. There also were many new deans, so it’s another
element in all of this. There was a big turnover in that whole group, so that
made a big difference, and Lyman did that. He encouraged all that.
Devaney: You’re saying Stanford decided to cooperate strategically with the
government to try to implement these things.
Miner: [00:57:43] To try to get a lead. We would meet with HEW, and it was, in
some ways--I have to be careful about this. It was sort of, I’d say, educational
again, because I, like everyone else, had an image that outside forces would
be simple and clear and sophisticated. Then you’d meet with the folks whose
job it was to enforce this, and you’d realize they didn’t know how to fix this.
They were career, nice people.
Stanford, in a sense, was attempting, and one part of it was to actually
think about things we could do that were creative and different and would
work, with the thought that we would do that to show to the external people
that we’re serious, so don’t come punish us, because it was protective. But
also, I think it was honest. I think that was hoped for. It was a hope.

49

Devaney: Do you think in those days that the university-federal government
partnership was, in fact, more of a partnership and that universities and the
government, in fact, did work closely together on many occasions to come to
some compromises and some changes that needed to be made?
Miner: [00:59:02] That would be an area where you or all the people in research
administration have deeper knowledge, but my sense is that there was more
cooperation, because after World War II is when the huge funding came
from the federal government for research. I would say in the HEW context,
there were many--I mean, I flew to Washington, I talked to J. Stanley
Pottinger, who was writing the guidelines on women. He was the associate
director of the Health, Education and Welfare who was charged with this
women and education problem. It was a problem from their point of view,
partly politically. Because what were they going to do? They didn’t know how
to solve it, and it was very contested.
Stanford, in that sense, was doing what you’re saying. It was attempting
to say, “Yes, we’re all in this together. We should solve this. We’re helping
people comment on the guidelines of what should happen.” I think it was a
mixture, but I think Stanford--if you look at the years, we were typically a
step ahead of what those regulations required. We were like one year ahead
of what they technically required, but we knew they were coming. We knew
that they were writing these guidelines.
When I was doing my study, I was slowly being educated about all that.
I didn’t know that, but I learned about that, so it was one of the many
contexts. When I wrote the recommendations, they were a mixture of what

50

others thought, women and men, there were many men who were very smart
and active. Good things to do, coupled with items that I knew were going to
be in federal guidelines within a year or two. It was good that Stanford just
got on with it. Those were the two sources, I would say, of what became
recommendations.
Devaney: Before you get to your recommendations and the report, talk more about
some hidden barriers that you encountered as you were trying to address
these issues.
Miner: [01:01:13] One of the things that surprises me, looking back at all this, is that
while the formal report came out in the fall of 1971-Devaney: This is your report in response to the charge from President Lyman.
Miner: [01:01:27] That is exactly right. It’s a big report. We published 12,000 copies
of it.
Devaney: That came in October. You got your charge in January. So now we’re talking
about the period between January and October when you were doing your
research.
Miner: [01:01:39] Yes, we are. I’m just going around talking to people. And this is
one that I feel is an example of when social change happens and it becomes
so embedded nobody can believe it wasn’t this way before. The women
faculty, because I was not a faculty member, all felt and reported, and it
seemed clear there were several things. One was the nepotism requirement.
It was widely believed and enforced in many cases that you couldn’t
have two family members [as faculty in a single department], but they’re
usually talking about a husband and wife, who were in the same department

51

as faculty. There were women scholars or PhD’s who were told you cannot
be here on the department faculty because of the nepotism policy. So that
was one.
Devaney: Was this a formal written policy?
Miner: [01:02:33] I think there’s a dispute about that. Clearly it was written at some
time, but whether or not it was formally written, it was so widely believed, it
was used and it was enforced. That was one where looking at records
recently, I think the new provost was especially helpful, because we thought,
“Why are we waiting for a report to later say we should get rid of the
nepotism policy? Everybody thinks it’s a bad idea, we can’t defend it, so we’ll
just get on with it.” In a sense, we implemented that issue.
Devaney: What do you mean you implemented that issue?
Miner: [01:03:15] I can’t remember the administrative details, but I think we had the
Committee on the Education of Women already, which we’d set up through
the Forum, so I believe that’s one that went there, and there was a
recommendation then. But I have a memo from me to some department
chairman of the med school who says--so this is like April, 1971-- the middle
of the report. There’s no report saying, “What is the thing on the nepotism
policy?”
I have checked with the provost, and I’m writing back saying, “The
provost says you can’t use them. You can’t use them. You can hire.”
Devaney: You mean there is no nepotism policy? That is, policy against hiring spouses?
Miner: [01:03:54] That’s right. So you just have to take [steps to avoid] a conflict of
interest.

52

That was a great one. I met a lot of people. There was somebody who
had to write that policy, had to write a clarification that’s clear what you had
to do.
Devaney: Was that written during that period?
Miner: [01:04:07] Yes. That was when that got issued, I’m pretty sure.
Devaney: Because up until that time, there were many, typically, the husband who had
the job and the wife was either called a research associate or a lecturer, even
though they may have met in graduate school, they got their PhD’s at the
same time, she may have been just as good a scholar.
We had a lot of wives who were either research associates or lecturers,
who never made it into the faculty until then. Did the change in that
nepotism policy result in more women -- or any women -- getting appointed
to faculty positions in those departments?
Miner: [01:04:39] Some, sure.
Another huge one, still a big issue today in higher education, is the
general concept--and I always thought it was important what we thought was
the general concept--that another way women felt, if they were on the
faculty, the huge barrier was given sex roles as they were enacted, which is
still mostly true--maybe we should clarify. The tenure clock is typically six
years, and you had that amount of time to get a certain number of
publications of some sort, and if you don’t have it, then you’re out of there.
You’re gone forever. It’s not like you’re not promoted. You’re gone, you’re
dead. You’re in another institution.

53

That happens to be the same age for many women when they’re having
children, so you have one group of people where, as they believed at the
time, the women are going home and helping the man get tenure, and then
you have these women who are having babies, and they’re supposed to be
writing the same number of publications. It doesn’t seem like a level playing
field, and that was why they leave. But the women had no right to take
maternity leave. Separate from that there was a question after you have the
baby, it’s not like you just get up the next morning and rush back to writing
your papers. There was the same thing. That spring, I believe, all those
policies got revised, and a very important one was maternity leave. That was
symbolic of a big issue, too, that it should be a right, not that you have to
grovel and say, “Well, can I not teach classes next fall because I’m having this
baby?” But more important-Devaney: What was the maternity-leave policy that got passed? The idea is that you got
several months off after having a baby, with a guarantee of getting your job
when you returned to work.
Miner: [01:06:36] One was to have a baby, yes, and that falls into all kinds of legal
questions, because there were laws about whether you had rights to take time
off for your baby, but that was also a big conceptual thing. That was one
where I felt a compromise--and you asked me to talk about some of my
feelings about all this. To get what was needed in practical terms, we had to
basically say that having a baby is like being sick. That’s what we had to say,
because that was the only way.
Devaney: Because you could use sick leave then for your maternity leave.

54

Miner: [01:07:07] That’s correct. If we wanted to get them paid any money during
the time they delivered a baby--this is kind of like having your liver out--we
had to do that. I remember thinking, “That doesn’t seem like a good longterm conceptual thing to have in society,” but I was a very practical person,
and most of us were, and we said, “We think they should get money when
they have these babies.”
Not everybody liked this at all. We had senior officers who would say
to me, “Anne, this is nuts. What are you talking about? We shouldn’t.”
Devaney: You shouldn’t pay women when they went to have babies?
Miner: [01:07:40] No. If they have a baby, it’s their problem. It’s a private action. It’s
not part of the public.
It took longer to get the policy done on the staff side, but we used the
same model where we said there are two issues. One is when you physically
have a baby, then you can have this paid leave. But you’re using sick leave, if
you want to do that. I just thought it was terrible to call having a baby being
sick, but you had to. Then the other question was what about all that time
when you take care of a baby.
Then there was a different war, which, again, is still happening. Those
of us who thought deeply about sex roles were thinking, “Well, why
shouldn’t the man be able to get time for infant care too? Because once
you’re not nursing, anybody could do that, in principle.” So we did do that.
On the staff side, there’s a parental-care leave.
Devaney: But that was far, far later.

55

Miner: [01:08:36] That one was a couple years later, but it was only because we had a
lot more people to work through the policy on the faculty side. Once we got
the right players, that kind of thing was pretty swift.
The main thing I’ll say that matters, leaving aside the infant-care
question, was that very spring we got this change that faculty could delay,
they could get a year’s extension of the tenure clock for every child they had.
Devaney: Women and men?
Miner: [01:09:04] I believe so. I would have to check on when the men came in.
Certainly eventually they did.
[01:09:09] But the point was that at that time we were mostly worried
about the women, and, again, it was an ideological thing. I felt it had to be
women and men, but I would have settled for women at that point.
We certainly did it for the women, because I remember that I was
reading that lately. There was a policy and that had national implications.
That was disputed all around the country.
Devaney: Did we lead the charge on that one, or was that pretty common among top
universities then?
Miner: [01:09:34] Not so common, because I remember going to meetings where I
would show that off as a proud thing that we had done quickly, that we got
done, and we didn’t have to have a big bloody war bath over it.
Devaney: So we were leaders in that one?
Miner: [01:09:44] I believe so.

56

Devaney: During that basically ten months that you were a consultant, you got rid of
the nepotism policy at a formal level. You got maternity leave for women,
although they had to get paid sick leave.
Miner: [01:09:59] Faculty, yes.
Devaney: But you also then extended the tenure clock to an entire year that women
could have longer to be considered for tenure, so they could take some work
off to take care of the baby or to nurse the baby or do something in that first
year.
Miner: [01:10:14] Yes.
Devaney: Were there any kind of part-time employment issues that came up? Could
faculty work part-time?
Miner: [01:10:30] Not at the time. It was believed that was not possible, and that was
again tied to the women who were already here. A lot of these issues, it does
have that theme. Could we tap the institution into the women who were
already present who had scholarly talent, from my point of view, was more
like could we be fair toward women.
The idea of part-time work--that was part of Jing Lyman’s idea. It was a
whole social movement, which probably didn’t really happen, that all the
issues about the sex roles would be solved better if we could have more parttime jobs. That was a very widely held idea nationally for everybody. It
seemed like, why not faculty? I loved that one. I remember Al Hastorf, who
was the dean of Humanities and Sciences. He was an inspired person, a
friend of all these issues, but way beyond being a sympathetic kind of smart
guy, he was very creative. Yes, there would be a formal change. It’s always

57

good to clarify, because the people say, “Was there really a prohibition?”
Maybe not in writing, but in effect there was a prohibition. So a statement
was put in writing that said part-time faculty employment is possible, and
that was then executed.
Devaney: Would that give you twelve years toward tenure if you were working halftime?
Miner: [01:11:48] You would have to look at the minutes of the meetings, and you
should have been on the committees, because that, of course, was a big issue.
I don’t remember the resolution. I just remember that that’s why that one
took longer, we had to get that one through.
Devaney: Were any men working part-time, or was this just a concession to women?
Miner: [01:12:07] The idea was both, but, I remember a female Anthropology
professor telling me, “You won’t believe this. We went to Dean Hastorf and
said we’d like to split a position or one-and-a-half positions, my husband and
I.” This is Francine Cancian and Frank Cancian. I think it was them. I
remember thinking, “Boy, this is exciting.” She was very young, and they felt
that they had not tricked the institution, but that they had found a way to get
something wonderful, as if they had won it from the institution.
I had just been in meetings months before where these [very same]
senior people were saying, ‘Well, we want to encourage this to happen, so
we’re going to set this up.” It’s like they set up a game in which something is
possible, and here were these people walking in excited to play the game.
That was the first time I had experienced what a central administration
can do that’s powerful and positive, because these were smart faculty people

58

who, once they saw the structure and the incentives, used it to do exactly
what the people designing the structure had in mind. I find that was a turning
point for me to see that you could do these little things, and they would
change behavior.
Devaney: Several faculty members at the time got the dean to agree that they would
have a one-and-a-half percent time faculty appointment, and they would
share that in some way? Did they both get tenure then?
Miner: [01:14:17] I don’t think so. I don’t think this has a happy ending. But
probably we should be candid on these tapes. I can’t swear it was Francine
who told me that. It was a faculty member from the Anthropology
Department who told me about this at a party.
Devaney: Forgetting the specifics, in general, would you say that part-time employment
for women faculty has actually been successful? Has it been broadly
implemented?
Miner: [01:14:42] I think it was important then and had symbolic impact then. It was
a token of faith from the campus. I’m sure if you looked at these cases, there
are some where it made a big difference. But was it actually a major structural
factor that changed many women? I do not believe that, but that’s because
the nature of the job of a faculty member is such that it’s a brutal,
competitive profession. Nobody in the outside world grasps how competitive
the major research universities are. So it’s like saying could you be a part-time
player for the Green Bay Packers? You could, but you would never start, and
your bones would be broken when you went out to play. [laughs] But it was
an important ideological change, and it affected some people’s lives.

59

Devaney: We’ve talked about faculty, but what about the graduate women who might
someday become faculty? Or talk about minority women in this process and
how were they affected.
Miner: [01:15:48] A major issue through all this, doing this study, I spent a lot of
time with Luis Nogales, with the senior officers in the university who were
members of some then-identified minority group, black assistant to the
president and the Chicana representatives--different language gets used for
these--the Black Association of Staff Women at the med school. There was a
big concern about the danger, which, to some degree, did happen, of the
focus on women wiping out the previous focus of previous focal groups, that
[were] seen as a legitimate people to worry about affirmative action for. That
was initially blacks, and then later Chicano, Latino, whichever word is okay
or is used.
Devaney: So, underrepresented minorities? That basically was black, Hispanics, and
American Indians.
Miner: [01:16:56] Yes.
Devaney: The minorities were covered first, in terms of the laws and regulations about
affirmative action programs. Women then came afterward. And because 51%
of the population is female, there was a worry that women were going to
upset the applecart for all of the ethnic minorities. Did that happen?
Miner: [01:17:17] I fear to some degree it did, but more in terms of attention. To be
clear, the issues with minority faculty are huge and systemic and to this day,
have not been solved in some fields. It’s not any different today. There’s
probably, I think, six black PhD’s from business schools now.

60

Devaney: Yes, I think we actually had more Hispanic faculty in 1971 at Stanford than
we do today.
Miner: [01:17:50] Could be, I don’t know. But I looked at some data today. Actually
minority faculty continued to increase during the time I was there in tiny
numbers. I don’t think it was an immediate threat. In staff employment, we
haven’t really talked about much, we did very well on hiring minority
secretaries, which was a huge issue and an important goal, but it was sort of
not a [contested] issue around the women’s side, except to make sure we did
that. On the other hand, I would say in the mental space of thinking about
the issues, clearly it was slightly easier, if you were a current dean, to deal
with some of the women’s issues when the issues had to do with a highly
educated woman just like you, except she’s a woman, than a faculty person
from another language or ethnic group or who comes from another culture
and is being incorporated into your world. It’s just the more different
somebody is, the more energy you have to put into dealing with that. Now, I
think in that sense, it did hurt those programs.
Devaney: Part of it was the availability pool, don’t you think, and a lot more women?
Miner: [01:17:50] That was my first point.
Devaney: You had a lot more women available to choose from.
Miner: [01:19:25] They’re both true, though, they did have them, and then there is a
kind of cultural gap to some degree. There were two things going on. The
other thing is, technically in the formal external issues, the employment
question had to do with who was hired in what jobs. But in the university
context--and this, too, is to this day, I think, to many people looking at it--it’s

61

an issue raised before, it’s that no matter how hard you work on hiring
minority or women faculty, if there aren’t many people in that pool, then
you’re just buying people who might be at the University of Wisconsin, but
then Stanford hires them. Is that worth something to Stanford? Sure. We
should do it. But does that help the national situation? Not at all.
A good thing that happened then, which I’m happy when I see it, I
basically wrote in my report about that and said that the whole program has
to include recruiting women into engineering, business, law, and we folded in
the formal structure in reporting as much as we could, that you have to
analyze those pools. That wasn’t totally successful, but I think we won the
battle conceptually that graduate student women representation was part of
the employment of women and intrinsic, and that was a big national question
too.
Devaney: You weren’t just trying to steal the same person from another institution.
You were trying to expand the pool within academia.
Miner: [01:21:05] If Stanford was going to do anything, in some areas the most
important thing you could do would be that--more than one woman in some
little department. If you have ten women on the market in computer science,
that’s really a national effect.
Devaney: That’s right. You are affecting the pool enormously. So here you had done all
of this in a period of only ten months.
Miner: [01:21:27] One pause in that. I have to say this because we have used this
convention here of “you.” But I didn’t do all that. I catalyzed it sometimes,
but it was this team of Lyman, Miller, Rosenzweig, a couple sympathetic

62

deans, and then we had this faculty. It was like all the players. I didn’t have
the power to do anything. I probably wrote or drafted part of the language
for those policy changes. I didn’t have the power to make them happen. That
would have been the provost and the president.
Devaney: Your job at that time was to study the status of women and to recommend
changes needed to achieve the elimination of sex discrimination and
employment. That was your job. You weren’t expected to actually implement
policy.
Miner: [01:22:16] I’m not saying we failed, but I’m saying we shouldn’t say I did it. It
was many other people.
Devaney: Well, a lot of big changes happened within that ten-month period without a
lot of argument.
Miner: [01:22:27] A relatively small amount.
Devaney: You had the right people in the right jobs who were in agreement.
Miner: [01:22:34] It was exciting. And they’re willing to defend people.
Devaney: Yes, because you were really moving out of people’s comfort zone and what
they’d been used to in all these areas.
Miner: [01:22:44] Yes. They all said, “You don’t want to assume.” It’s funny. They
did assume women had more stakes in children’s issues, but they did in the
sense that institutionally we should fix it. That is not a block. That was new.
Devaney: To what extent was it that these were very special people, or was it the
culture that was changing, society was changing, and these people were
changing along with society at this time?
Miner: [01:23:12] Which? That people were willing to go along with these things?

63

Devaney: The people you’ve identified.
Miner: [01:23:19] A little bit. I’m sure that was from a fundraising model in my head.
I learned this whole style and only involved the people who are for
something or who have key knowledge. You might involve people who are
against it, but you need to learn what those arguments were. I know one vice
president, as I said, hated all this. He said, “This is really stupid. We shouldn’t
get into anything about children at all. This is sick. It’s morally wrong.”
[laughs] And he was not alone. I think it was a mixture of the cohort of
senior administrators with a general culture change, because everybody was
reading the newspaper and all. There was still the grassroots. There were
women all the time writing magazine articles and talking about this.
[01:24:28] Later on, after I was the affirmative action officer, we were
presenting about our plan and program. Stanford has high status, so people
from other schools who had less national standing wanted to hear from us
what we were doing so they could go to their school and say, “See, Stanford
did that, so we can do that.”
We were at the AAAS, the American Association for the Advancement
of Science. There were two of us, and we gave a presentation on our plan
and program. This was a year later. It was after all this, but a lot of this stuff
was in there. Someone in the audience said the same question that you just
asked me. They said, “How do you account for this happening? Because we
don’t think of Stanford as a radical school.” It wasn’t going to be at the
forefront of social change, in their view.

64

I gave some long answer like I just gave about complicated things. My
colleague with me was Professor Bienenstock [Arthur Bienenstock], who was
then the faculty affirmative action officer. He said, “Well, that’s all true, but
you also want to keep in mind that Stanford is a university that has a
president whose wife--,” and he named something that she did, like
“publishes things about women’s work” and so on “and a provost whose
wife runs an abortion clinic.”
He used that phrase to get that shock value. But he was saying he
thought it had to do with the personal values of the two senior officers on
the academic side. So I don’t know the answer.
Devaney: You’ve established now that in October of 1971, Stanford’s two senior
officers had wives who were really on the team here.
Miner: [01:26:31] Yes, that was one part of the context.
Devaney: But you then submitted your report to the president, as requested, which was
called “Academic Employment of Women at Stanford.” You issued this in
October of 1971, and in which you said, yes, we have a lot of women, but
they’re all in clerical and office positions, that the professional positions are
pretty much dominated by men. You showed that ethnic minorities were also
underrepresented and you said affirmative action efforts clearly were needed
for both faculty and staff positions at Stanford.
Most of your report focused on the employment of faculty, and by
that, we’re talking about those people that were specifically hired just to teach
and direct Stanford’s research programs, rather than staff whose jobs support
the faculty and the institution as a whole. In your report, you showed data

65

that only 4.5 percent of all of Stanford’s faculty were women in 1971, with
no women faculty at all in four of the university’s seven schools. Only 2
percent of full professors were women, and no woman had ever been a dean.
How did you go about that study, and what was involved in gathering that
data?
Miner: [01:27:45] This is the study we’ve just been describing, starting from January
in consulting the many groups.
Devaney: That’s very specific data, and that had probably not ever been collected
before, had it?
Miner: [01:27:56] I don’t think they had collected it before. I had a little office over
near where Merrill Carlsmith was working on the study of education.
[01:28:04] He was a professor in Psychology, and he was running the
Study on Education at Stanford, another huge study going on at the time. I
just worked there. I had a faculty advisory group of people who helped me
get those data, and there were many. One question is which universities to
use to compare to Stanford. You knew if you included all universities in your
comparison, Stanford faculty would say, “Well, of course, those are all bad
schools so they have more women. We have higher standards.” You knew
that was going to happen, right? So we were very careful in selecting our
comparisons. We compared Stanford first to other top schools, University of
Chicago. [laughs] And we were worse than them. That was a conscious
choice in terms of framing the data, so you couldn’t escape it, but then we
did show it compared to all other universities.

66

Devaney: We were worse not only than places like Chicago, we were worse than the
typical average university?
Miner: [01:29:06] We were way worse than that. You knew that would happen
because they were bad schools, of course, they had more women. That’s a
joke. We thought about it: How do we present these numbers to frame it so
it seems legitimate?
Devaney: Stanford could not justify its lack of women because it was a top school
because that they could see that other top schools had done better than
Stanford had at that point?
Miner: [01:29:31] But our goal at that point was not, quote, “Stanford,” in the sense
of the president. He didn’t have any doubt this was a problem. He knew, and
he had opposed many things. The purpose of, or one of the purposes of the
report, was the normal faculty member who was nervous or said, “This
doesn’t seem like a good idea,” or “I’m against this.” Or mostly the deepest
problem was, “Why bother?”
Devaney: I’d like to quote one of the things you said in your report that I thought was
very eloquent. You said, “The low number of women faculty means that
many Stanford students complete their entire undergraduate or graduate
education without ever interacting with a member of the regular faculty who
is female. It means that women students in particular receive the continuous
covert lesson that in spite of whatever may be possible in theory, it is not
possible or even natural in fact for women to aspire to serious scholarly
achievement.”

67

Miner: [01:30:39] Yes, let’s talk about that for a second. Remember when we were
talking before about the external and legal pressures. Those were all about
employment rights. You’re not going to do something. This is a completely
different argument here.
Devaney: This is the guts of the matter.
Miner: [01:31:04] In my opinion, it is, and I saw it as being about sex roles, in
general, and that is the 50- or 100-year project. From that point of view, this
is just an instantiation [or embodiment of the issues]. This is just a case
where sex roles have this brutally terrible outcome, from my perspective. But
you knew that it’s not just the men. The Sally or Bob faculty person or
person who influences things could really dispute the discrimination side.
They might not even care, or they might say, “Tough luck,” or whatever. But
they often typically did care about students. People deeply care about
students in the great universities. Even if they don’t pay attention to them,
they do.
The point of this report in many ways was partly to make that very
point, that it’s completely unrelated to the external things. Our deep values as
a research institution that trains people, and as educators, include the wellbeing of those people, and how can you do that to those students? That was
the spirit.
Devaney: Yes, far more compelling than trying to adhere to some federal regulation.
Miner: [01:32:17] Exactly. So it was transforming in some cases that were technical
requirements, but saying, “Well, why?” Seriously, we didn’t have to do all

68

that. We could have resisted. A lot of things didn’t get done. But that was the
spirit.
Many of the things I wrote have little side essays. If you read the
report, there’s something about--well, maybe you think this doesn’t happen,
but actually there’s a little study that shows there’s unconscious
discrimination. Nobody asked me to do that, and looking back, I don’t know
where in heaven’s name I got the courage to do that. I mean, I believed it,
but I don’t know. That had to have been my colleagues around me saying,
“No, no, you should put that in,” including all the women faculty and men
faculty who cared, who were saying, “Yes, yes, do it. Do it.”
Devaney: Yes, and people with good hearts were discriminating without even realizing
it.
Miner: [01:33:10] Of course, that was the main issue. But one more time, it is almost
impossible to remember how taken for granted the assumption was that
women don’t want to do this, that they shouldn’t be--it’s not like “kind of”
or a few of them might. No women. The women’s role was to help men do
things. That was it. There were a few weird people who didn’t do that role,
but you would never think that was, quote, “a problem.” There’s no
problem.
Devaney: It’s just the way society was.
Miner: [01:33:45] It’s how it should be, yes. This is part of that attempt to convert
that saying, “No, no, there is a problem.” That happens all the time in
organizations, that if you want to get something done, you have to reframe it
so what was okay is a problem.

69

Devaney: Well, we’re starting to talk about the fact that you had completed your report
to the president. Then Stanford had posted an opening for a new full-time
affirmative action officer. There had been an early affirmative action officer,
Luis Nogales, but he also was an advisor to the president, an assistant on
Mexican American Affairs, and he had other kinds of responsibilities. Then
he left Stanford. He became a White House fellow.
Then, Stanford had a job opening for the first full-time affirmative
action officer, and there were some two hundred applicants for this job from
throughout the country.
Miner: [01:34:58] That I did not know.
Devaney: And you were selected in June of 1972. Now, this was considered to be a
major appointment. You were now a major university officer. This was
covered in the press in various parts of the country. What were your duties
now that you were the Stanford affirmative action officer?
Miner: [01:35:22] Yes. I remember I sent to my parents a press release from the [Palo
Alto Times, 1972, Editorial on appointment as full time affirmative action
officer]. A previous article about the initial appointment San Jose Mercury News
that said [something like] “Women’s Libber appointed to major post at
Stanford.” [Actual headline was “Women’s Lib Aide Gets Key Post at
Stanford.” That’s indicative of the times. It wasn’t just weird to do, but it was
like it made a danger of Stanford as being tarred, as being deviant. You
know, “What are you doing with a women’s libber in administration?”
Devaney: This was the charter of the job.

70

Miner: [01:35:56] The conception, it wasn’t a complicated thing, the result of all the
conversations about all these things you might do about women. In the
report that I wrote to the president, there are twenty-eight recommendations
of what should be done, and they included appointing a woman to work for
the provost--I had forgotten this--to be coordinating the faculty side, because
it clearly had to be a faculty member who was the public advocate for the
faculty issues for the long run. Because anyone who is not a faculty member
has zero credibility, unless they’re like you, Patricia Devaney, who gained
great credibility with the faculty. [laughter] You get that, right? But it’s true.
Devaney: [laughs]
Miner: [01:36:45] My point is, there were twenty-eight recommendations, and they
all were things that would be part of an affirmative action plan, and they were
things like documenting hiring.

Devaney: This is Pat Devaney interviewing Anne Miner in my house. It is June 26,
2014, and this is our interview session number two.
Anne, last time we talked a lot about your early life and your experience
at Stanford the year before you were appointed consultant to the president
for affirmative action for women. And we talked about the context in which
you were working. We had many riots on campus because of the Vietnam
War. Windows were being broken and people were throwing rocks through
them. We had the military coming out and trying to keep the protesters in
check. The Women’s Movement was part of something much bigger. It was
sort of unparalleled social change in American universities, and it was quite
momentous that you were able to accomplish all that you did in the context
of all of the stuff going on at Stanford.
Let’s go back and talk a little bit about the recommendations in the
report you submitted to President Lyman after you had done your study
about the status of women faculty. Can you summarize what those
recommendations were and where Stanford went with them?

73

Miner: [00:01:29] Sure. But before I do that, I need to clarify. I think you’re entirely
right about the nature of the chaos going on, but actually the existence of so
much other social change is one reason it was easy to do. First of all, I didn’t
make those changes. Everybody did; it was a collective thing, [including men
such as] Carl Degler, and many other women.
The point is, the general chaos and social change made it easier for
people to accept change about women because it was like everything was up
for grabs. Remember, I mentioned the strongly radical people, so the women
in SDS, Students for a Democratic Society, the strong antiwar…. Remember,
they were the Weather Underground. They were actually blowing up
buildings.
[00:02:23] They were anti-Vietnam, but they were also anti-social class,
which is a deeper thing, too. It was about anti-elitism. In a way, it made it
hard because, as you pointed out, it meant the administration faced this
multipronged world--everything’s falling apart.
On the other hand, it enabled change because this was seen as just one
more goofy thing. I shouldn’t use that language, but I think another
interesting point is if you read the medical school documents from the early
time, which became a point of great struggle and confrontation in the
university, the early documents will say things like--this is not me; this is
other women, smart powerful women--: “One thing we intend to do when
we work with you, Dean, about changing things in the med school here, is
we want to do things in a ladylike way.” They [some, not all] use that exact
phrase.

74

Why are they saying that? They’re saying it because of what you are
pointing out--that the context is one where other people are throwing
bombs. So they’re saying, “Stick with us.” Implicitly, the message is, “We
don’t intend to be that kind of a problem in this world.”
This is some women, not all women. Other women were saying, “We
will throw a bomb.” But I agree with you that context had the double edge
of, in a way, making it harder on the administration to know what to do, and
maybe struggling in some ways more. On the other hand, it definitely made it
easier to propose some kind of change because everywhere there was change.
Devaney:

You came on as the consultant to the president to do this study in January
of 1971, and in October you submitted your report with all of its
recommendations. Could you talk about those recommendations?

Miner: [00:04:11] Thank you for asking about them. They were the sum of my own
thinking and then endless consultations with many people and attention to
the federal guidelines about what we had to do or what they wanted us to do.
There were twenty-one [numbered] recommendations, [regarding the
Academic Council] so it was a big long thing, very detailed, and basically it
had two big parts. [It also included 13 recommendations regarding nonAcademic Council and research roles].
This report is on academic employment of women, so it mentions
lecturers and research associates, but it’s still academic jobs [only]. The entire
six thousand people who were not academic employees were a later project
in terms of what the structure would be. This one said, “But we should have
the structure,” and most are about what the [president and] provost should

75

do, mainly about the provost, and then many about deans. It’s basically
saying formally we have to start differentiating, within one thing that might
seem like one huge giant issue, which is the employment of women at
Stanford. It’s like many, many subcultures and areas and practices and, on the
academic side, when the provost should do most things.
Devaney: Let’s back up for a second. Let’s define our terms. What do we mean by
academic women?
Miner: [00:05:30] That’s a good point. We have the Academic Council, the group I
think we talked about yesterday, which received by far the most attention,
and that is deliberate because Stanford is a major research university. In the
end--if what you’re interested in doing is making long-term major change
which is hard to reverse--what you need to influence is the nature and values
and composition of the people who are the tenured research faculty. In the
end, what research universities do that no other institution does is produce
research. That’s what counts.
Devaney: So the Academic Council, in fact, consists of people who are working toward
their tenure, as well as people who do have tenure, as well as research
professors, as well as professors teaching. It’s the people who are appointed
to actually direct the teaching and direct the research. So there were, I don’t
know, a thousand of those people as compared to six thousand on the staff.
Miner: [00:06:30] Correct. We’re focusing on the thousand, and, even with that,
mostly on Academic Council kind of issues, because that was where the
power and the permanent part of the institution is. That may be a sad thing,
but that’s the truth. That’s what the formal recommendations mostly cover.

76

They recommend that the provost should publicly state that we want to do
something about it, that we’ll create goals and timetables, that the provost
will appoint a person in the office. It says, “The provost will appoint in his
office an academic woman who will be a member of his senior staff who will
allocate approximately three-quarters of her time to the administration of
affirmative action for academic women, including--,” and then it goes on and
on and on and on.
Another thing that was recommended was salary equity studies by year.
An important issue that was recommended was to do something about
tenure, how does gender affect that-Devaney: What do you mean? How does gender affect tenure?
Miner: [00:07:35] There were many concerns that there was discrimination in the
tenure process. Remember, we have people who come in, and there’s lots
more of these people, and then they’re here typically six years, and it’s like a
game or tournament. In those six years, you have a shot at getting tenure,
and if you get tenure, then you cannot be dismissed, except for being a
criminal or various other things. It’s a lifetime appointment to protect
academic freedom.
But you could see in the numbers there were way more women in the
assistant professors, the lower level, than associate and up, which is typically
the tenured level. So without really addressing it in the report, the
recommendation says that the provost is supposed to do a review and
articulate the issues that are standing in the way of tenure acquisition for

77

women. Some of those things were at the time believed to be childcare and
the joint appointments and all that stuff.
[00:08:35] But everyone knew that in some ways it was a boys’ club,
some of the aspects of the tenured faculty. This report flagged that and said
there should be affirmative institutional activity to investigate what are the
barriers to women getting tenure, which, at Stanford, I’m sure, was and
probably still is a continuing struggle. That’s a very hard, subtle issue. But
that was in there, that that would be a proactive thing to do. Also that we
should study the lecturers and the research associates who were not in the
Academic Council but were carrying out many duties in the university.
Just to wrap this up, another recommendation was that each dean was
supposed to look at policies and programs and advance searches, and I think
it also actively pushed the idea of working on the pool that we’ve talked
about before in areas where there aren’t very many women candidates--if you
have to have a PhD to do this, then you had to look at how many PhD’s
there were. For minorities, and for women in some fields, there weren’t very
many. So a dean could think, “All right. We need more women geologists,
and I’ll put a lot of my energy into that.” This report recommended that they
do that.
Devaney: Before we get into what happened to those recommendations, let’s move on
to the next phase of your life, which is your appointment as a full-time
affirmative action officer at Stanford in June of 1972. The stated duties of
your job, as written in some report, were to, quote, “provide coordination
between faculty and staff programs and support for the principal officers and

78

their line managers in terms of staff affirmative action.” In addition, you
were Stanford’s official liaison officer with outside compliance agencies as
well as one of several university officers working with minority and women’s
groups. So to whom did you report in this job?
Miner: [00:10:49] The early structure, you can see in this 1971 report--the beginning
of not just me, but Stanford trying to figure out the right way to structure
this--it was clear there had to be a faculty-versus-staff emphasis, but some
things were across all areas. Initially, the answer to the question is that it
morphed quite a bit in the first few years, and I don’t even remember exactly
all of them, because we couldn’t quite figure out how to set it up. In the end,
I reported to President Lyman.
There was an earlier period where I think I reported to the vice
president for business and finance, but that wasn’t working. Similarly, there
were duties and things that would shift back and forth between me and the
Provost’s Office. We had never done this before. Nobody knew how to do
it. So we experimented.
Devaney: Why didn’t it work for you to report to the vice president for business and
finance?
Miner: [00:11:51] If I were going to guess, looking back, it was a structural thing that
had to do with the symbolic importance of a reporting relationship to a
president, and that as long as it was under business and finance, it didn’t have
enough status, because staff did not have the same status as faculty in a
research university, sort of these terrible truths. It was sort of like a medieval
society, and in the medieval society, faculties were the royalty and everybody

79

else was not. You can’t have somebody who’s a commoner reporting to a
duke, trying to tell one of the king’s men what to do.
[00:12:36] Everybody was kind of wandering around and eventually-not very long, maybe a couple years into it, or maybe a year--it was decided,
no, if this is going to work, it’s got to be under the president. That’s why my
main advisors were the legal advisor to the president and Robert Rosenzweig,
because they were on the president’s staff, and they were my main kind of
consultants, other than people who were real faculty in the field.
Devaney: The people who were directly responsible for implementing affirmative
action programs for staff and faculty were men. The people to whom you
reported or had gotten your primary advice from were men. Basically you
had oversight responsibilities for some men and you reported to men, but
they were all men. Did they take a shared view of the importance of
affirmative action and the direction it should take?
Miner: [00:13:33] That’s a good question. One interesting thing is I never noticed
what you just said until I got that question from you just now, that those
were all men, because I think it is for me as though professionally I always
worked with all men.
[00:13:55] I mean, as many people have discussed--and I, too, later
realized--it was more of a struggle for me to work with women. In fact, later
we’ll talk about my role working in CROW, when I was a co-director of
CROW, the Center for Research on Women, which was this really cool thing
that started at Stanford.

80

Devaney: Which is currently the Institute for Women and Gender, right, the Clayman
Institute?
Miner: [00:14:22] That is the one, in between other names.
When I took on that role [Co-Director of CROW], I remember
observing that the habits of interaction, the ways I dealt with people, had all
been learned in context where, for the most part, I was the only woman.
When I actually had to share influence or work with women who were
powerful and had control over me, I had to learn some other things. I was
uncomfortable. It wasn’t what I was used to.
[00:14:50] I was used to this other setting. So at the time, I was like a
fish in water, I didn’t notice the water, of course.
In terms of the other question, did they share the same view or my
view--is that the question?
Devaney: Was this a unit? Because you said you were all trying to figure this out
together, and how it was all going to work. Were they kind of all fish
swimming in the same direction or were they just like herding cats?
Miner: [00:15:20] Yes, more than you might think, because the other key person
would have been the provost Bill Miller. I think an important thing to
remember is they were all learning to work with each other. I was on many
dean searches.
[00:15:38] All of them are trying--they were, “How should this chart
work and where is this?” Didn’t they create the vice president’s group around
that time? There was a whole new structure created for many sorts of
decisions. This was just one of those things, and they were enough of a mind

81

that it seems to me that it was why there really was a different flavor here
from some other schools, and it was because of all that turnover. There
weren’t people who were entrenched.
Devaney: So the governance of the university on this issue was basically new and,
therefore, they didn’t have traditions they had to follow. They were kind of
figuring it out themselves so they could be pioneers as they proceeded.
Miner: [00:16:21] I believe that’s the case. They were more willing and able to do
that because they didn’t have to do it, including the deans.
Devaney: You were also the university’s liaison with external compliance officers and
presumably the press. It seems to me that you were in the news quite a bit.
How did they treat you, the press or the federal government?
Miner: [00:16:38] I mentioned the “Women’s Libber” headline in the San Jose
Mercury, so initially they treated me just the way the culture was struggling.
Some would be very serious and respectful. Others would think this was a
joke. Others assumed it was some kind of symbolic gesture that meant
nothing, which happens a lot in organizations. They do that--say, “We should
care.”
I do remember one transition, which may be stemming from the focus
of these interviews you’re doing, which is my whole previous experience in
any public situation had been as staff. I was involved in writing lots of things
that somebody said to the public, but what I was doing, I was writing a script
that I gave to Kenneth Cuthbertson, who was the vice president for
development, or that I gave to Richard Lyman, who was the president.

82

I never gave those talks. I was the person behind the stage, and a big
transition for me in ’71, ’72, after I took this job, was that I had to be the one
who gave the talk. It took me a year to learn when the reporter called, don’t
answer the question. Answer with what you want to see in the paper. That’s a
kind of simple idea, but I never knew that.
It took me some articles that weren’t what I wanted, and so the next
time you call and said, “What do you think of the war in Vietnam?” I said, “I
think there should be a change in sex roles.” [Devaney laughs.] That was a
big education about that public role.
As far as the federal government, they were fine. They were respectful.
Stanford has such a national, international level of status and power, that
when you walk in from Stanford, you could be a paper bag and they don’t
care what your gender or anything else is, it’s like, “You’re Stanford.”
I did have a woman in Health, Education and Welfare explain to me
that she went out of the way every time she possibly could to make sure
money did not go to Stanford if at all possible because it was an elitist,
condescending, sexist, racist institution.
[00:19:13] [laughs] It was so interesting, because it was evidence of the
internal diversity in the government. The government’s not one thing, right?
This woman’s doing that. Someone else is a friend of some Stanford--well,
something happened in that era. There was a proposal to have some of these
gender issues to apply to teaching. I think it was in a regulation proposal,
because there were new regulations, and one regulation came through and
everybody’s reviewing them. I am, but also Lyman. One of them, a proposed

83

regulation from HEW, said something like, “And then you will, as part of
your affirmative action program, review all the syllabi for all the classes for
sexism.” Well, that sort of made sense to those of us who wanted to change
the world.
Lyman picked up the phone, as I recall, called Califano [Joseph A.
Califano, Jr.], who was the secretary of Health, Education and Welfare,
whom he knew well. He said, “You don’t want to do that.” This is a phone
call. This is not a letter. This is not a report. It’s a phone call. He says,
“You’ve got to agree that’s crazy. We can’t have that, because that’s
interfering with intellectual freedom of the faculty,” which it was. So he said,
“That has to go,” and it was gone. That was a phone call on a Friday. It was
out of there by Monday.
At the time, I was impressed by that process and educated, and I
understood. I learned from it, but that is sort of my own journey now [in my
current full professor position at Wisconsin]. If there was even a whiff of
something like that in anything I’m connected with, I would [want to]
assassinate the person who said someone should review what I teach in a
course, because now I’ve internalized all those norms about a university has
to have the faculty free to teach whatever they want to teach. But at the time,
yes, it just seemed to me not a bad idea. [laughs]
Devaney: I think it was also an example of what we talked about earlier, the kind of
partnership that seemed to exist between universities and the federal
government on many levels, when telephone conversations actually were very
effective in resolving a lot of different issues.

84

Miner: [00:21:25] Sure. But it was also adversarial because, as you pointed out the
other day, they held up millions of dollars of contracts at Harvard and
Michigan, so it was both. We had the woman who wanted to punish
Stanford, and the other, all at the same time.
Devaney: Let’s talk about your job now as the university’s affirmative action officer.
What were some of the key activities you were engaged in?
Miner: [00:21:44] First, let’s sort them into the cross-campus ones and then the staff
ones. If you don’t mind, I’ll talk about the staff first because I did have a
point-person role on the staff side. There I was the main oversight person
doing it, and then on the campus side I was working with many other people.
Would that make sense?
Devaney: Sure. You’re talking about the staff affirmative action for the non-faculty
employees at Stanford, of whom there were like six thousand?
Miner: [00:22:16] Right. I had to turn to that in an operational sense as my main
focus. One curious thing, is why was there never a parallel report? I was
going to write another report on staff at Stanford, which would talk about all
these things, but it became clear then that it took many months to write a
report that you could issue in an institution like Stanford. You can’t be
screwing around, as you pointed out. You can’t have the numbers wrong. It
all has to be organized. It had to have writing. By then, it was like the train
was leaving. We were already committed to doing things. There was no
doubt we were going to do something. I turned instead to actually changing
things and writing [policies or specific program documents].

85

The point is, we knew we had two big issues regarding staff. One was
minority representation in general, still a big issue, and we had many activists,
personnel and elsewhere. But my job was to help that be coordinated and
integrate the women into it. The second issue, which is better perhaps to talk
about, is upward mobility for everybody. Any minorities and women who are
here, they weren’t in any major position, so how was that to be changed.
A great deal of what I did was trying to work on that project. In fact I
did find a report from an early point where we said we need to identify
people in the personnel department who will be point people on upward
mobility for particular groups. Again, kind of using the fundraising model,
they were supposed to particularly identify good candidates who were
minorities on campus and be watching them. You, Pat Devaney, were a
general person on women. So you remember that.
Devaney: Many, many years ago that was, yes.
Miner: [00:24:13] It was many efforts to figure out what could you do about this
upward mobility. One conclusion that many of us drew--you and myself
included--was that [the lack of mobility for minorities and women] was a
great example of a problem that was not just applicable to minorities and
women, that most mid-level staff at Stanford, not faculty--these would be
associate deans, people in the Dean of Students’ Office, people in contract
administration, all around the campus--that the typical career pattern was to
get in one area, it was very difficult to get out. There weren’t too many
people moved across departments at Stanford. Some people did, but not
many.

86

The complexity of doing things in this kind of an institution was such
that simple models, especially like those taught in business schools about
“oh, you need a clear goal and then you set some kind of schedule and that’s
going to happen,” were useless to the people who were-Devaney: You mean career goals.
Miner: [00:25:16] Well, no--how to get things done. Both. The career goal point, but
first it was clear that there was not going to be what you call succession
planning in a university, which is what people thought some companies did.
We would have a plan. “Pat, here are your talents. Here’s our ten-year plan
for your career.” People were expecting that. But that was not compatible
with the decentralized university where there is no [simple] structure.
Devaney: And each hiring officer had the right to make his or her own hiring decisions.
Miner: [00:25:52] That’s right. So the personnel did. But that same issue [complex,
decentralized structure and processes] comes up in how you actually get
anything done. We used to draw a picture in the seminar that we ran that was
a big circle, where you start on the outside of the circle if you want to get
something done, and the president and those people were in the middle. If
you have an issue, sometimes you just have to go around the whole circle.
You go to your dean and another dean and another dean and another dean.
It’s not a power structure like a firm where there’s a clear hierarchy. It’s a
weird collegial system.
The second thing that a lot of people faced in these middlemanagement positions was how to get things done in that kind of world? I
helped prototype with some other people something we called the Tooth

87

Fairy Seminar. I don’t know if you remember that. It was called the Tooth
Fairy Seminar because many of the mid-level people, including minorities
and women--this I suppose may not have been the greatest thing--kind of
had an assumption that there was a tooth fairy who would come and give
them the key to their mobility. The point of the Tooth Fairy Seminars is to
say, “No. It’s a Darwinian system, so the advancement comes from you
learning how to get things done in a way that makes you stand out, and then
you can influence your own fate.” That was the spirit. That eventually
became the management development program that was institutionalized.
It came, in part, not only from me but because people in the personnel
office agreed with all this, but it was very much something that I spent
enormous amounts of time on because I believe that it didn’t do any good to
get a dean who was told he had to hire a woman or minority to do something
if there wasn’t a person who actually was more sophisticated about how to
get things done. We were trying to add that into it. So that was one thing we
worked on.
Another example was the affirmative action seminars, which we ran for
I don’t know how long, and that was about a two-hour seminar, which was
similar because it was seminars. It’s different because it was university-wide.
It was about just what we talked about earlier: What is affirmative action and
why are we doing it? We actually had a workbook there where participants
had to answer questions. A mixture of people attended the seminars. It
would be by area, so it would be department heads, faculty, maybe a third
faculty.

88

Devaney: Were they required to go?
Miner: [00:28:13] That’s a wonderful question. They should have been required to
go. I suspect they weren’t. I don’t know, can’t remember.
It was an effort to do this education and speed up processes. But it did
do what we talked about yesterday. The movie that started the seminar began
with a symphony, whose name I can’t remember, but I heard it over and over
again, very loud clashes. It was sort of like Beethoven something or other,
and then it shows a picture of $10 million class-action lawsuit. It told about
the legal basis for some aspects of these things, and it had a very frightening
effect. It was to underscore that while we’re doing things for the reasons you
and I’ve talked about--we’re doing it because it’s good for the world and it’s
good for our students--if we don’t get it right, this is on the compliance side,
then terrible things could happen. Many people did not understand that. It
was a mixture of positive, what do you do, but it had this element of
clarifying. Those were some things that were very important on the staff side,
from my point of view.
Devaney: What about issues of salary equity?
Miner: [00:29:22] Great question. In the ’71 report, I recommended that there be
salary review every year of salary equity for everybody. I believe even maybe
in our formal plan we said that we would start this, called the Salary Equity
Project. But it devolved then along these two lines of the Provost’s Office
doing anything about the faculty side, and then personnel and my office
doing the rest of the six thousand people. That project was a great example
of the naiveté on my side and I would think the personnel people knew this

89

was a slightly delusional thought that we could do it in ten months or
something.
[00:30:19] I remember there was a job classification project. We had all
these people who were getting reviewed. What are they? So it’s very hard to
do salary equity when you don’t know how to compare apples and oranges.
It was all munged up. It was all bundled up with that.
Peggy Riedman, whom we talked about yesterday, who was in charge in
that project, would say, “We can’t do this group. We have to run the analysis
by average salary and by this group and by that group.”
The great thing that happened, which was interesting, I thought, was
we were going along and we would just run big reports. I will tell this funny
story. We ran one report. This took a long time to get done. The only data at
that time you could use was payroll data. Personnel did not have a system yet
that worked. We were running all these categories in the mean by men and
women. What was the mean salary? Well, some of these categories, it was
really not accurate in the sense they were huge categories [payroll groups with
many people in different roles]. They were all put together technically. In any
event, when you ran the mean analysis, and you saw means for men, and for
women, there was always a very large difference between the salaries of men
and women.
Devaney: And minorities?
Miner: [00:31:37] Yes, though there was less. Minorities, we’ve often found out, all
these analyses, the sample size was not big enough that you could draw any
statistical conclusions. But, yes, there were consistent patterns.

90

I gave that to the chief legal counsel for the university, for a weekend. I
said, “You know, we’ve got to do something here on this. Take a look at this
thing.”
I met with him the next week, and he sat it on his desk. He was a great
ally, and he was completely behind all this, but he also was a funny man. He
said, “Well, Anne, I read it through. There seem two reasonable conclusions.
One is that we have a salary equity problem that we should fix. The other is
the women really are inferior.” [laughter]
[00:32:23] I thought it was hilarious. I mean, he could say that because
he was an ally and he never thought that was the case.
We first had to make the case that it was important to do, and then we
embarked on this long project. That went on for a long time. The part I liked
about it was it was one of these creative, opportunistic things that are so fun
to be part of. We did have some changes we knew we could do, and that was
really, mainly in the personnel department--people who could do the volume
of calculations, saying we should do this, and this, and this. We were all
working together. President Nixon created the wage price freeze, as you may
remember. You couldn’t change prices, and you couldn’t change wages, so
Stanford was forbidden by the federal government from raising anybody’s
salary at that time, and it didn’t.
[00:33:25] This had to be ’72, because I think I was already in this job.
I’d have to look at the year, but it had to be when I had some formal
responsibility.

91

The interesting thing was in that wage price freeze nationally on all
employers, not just universities, there was an exception, which is if you were
making an equity change. You could change somebody’s salary if they were a
woman or minority and you were fixing a salary inequity.
We went to the vice president’s group, Peggy and I, and we said, “We
think we should take advantage of that provision in the regulation,” and we
laid out three approaches and made an estimate of how much money it
would cost. I think it was $50,000 versus $300,000 versus $1.5 million. Those
were our estimates based on something, and we deliberately set it out, so we
thought, “The middle looks kind of attractive here,” and that’s what they did.
They approved this project and said there would be a campus-wide
project, not just faculty, and all of the changes would go back to the
beginning date of the project, ’71, and you won’t get hurt if you didn’t get
your case reviewed until April. We can do this, because it’s a loophole.
[00:34:50] The money allocated had to have been in the order of a
hundred thousand dollars to three hundred thousand dollars. I think it was
less than $1 million, I think it was more than fifty thousand, but I’d have to
go look. To cover adjustments, salary adjustments.
[00:35:06] This all has to do with what you want to call equity, right? If
equity is within your job classification, you are making less than other people
[in exactly the same job classification]. That’s the strictest one [definition].
Devaney: What if you’re a man and you’re making less? Is that equity?

92

Miner: [00:35:25] You’re not allowed to solve the problems by hurting men. You can
only solve the problem by bringing women and minorities up. You’re not
allowed to take money away from men.
Devaney: But in the course of a study, you could see the average salary is x, and here’s
a high-performing man whose salary is at the twenty-fifth percentile. Would
he have been included in that?
Miner: [00:35:45] This is why it takes years and years and years to do salary equity
stuff, because the minute you go--and it seems like a simple idea--you do
these pictures, and it says, “Well, wait, there’s all--.” You do scattergrams,
too, that show where the salaries are, and then you get into exactly these
kinds of questions, and it’s very hard to be effective without having expert
knowledge. How do you know he’s a high-performing man? Why do you say
that?
There are different ways to do it. One is you do salary matches. You
just match people in pairs and say, “Shouldn’t their salaries be the same?”
The point here is simply that we then embarked upon doing it at all,
and there were many people involved. The first pass, it had to have been
around that much money, maybe half-a-million dollars, I would think. But
looking back, you’d have to say it signaled we should have seen better than
we did, that this was a twenty-year project, because even if you do one round
of corrections, it turns out--two things--that the method, it wasn’t adequate.
That wasn’t quite right, because we didn’t control for performance, right, or
we didn’t control for length of service, etc. The other one is even if you fix
it--and I have seen this in my own life in the last ten years--most institutions

93

I know, they fix it and then even if it was right, if somebody could think that
something was right, it erodes.
[00:37:17] I would say what got done in that era was a typical pattern--if
you had like a band [of salaries with high and low borders] women were
below the line of what the minimum should be. You’ve got dots, and most
people are in the middle, some people are above the line--in personnel, it
would be that graph that has the length of service, right? It’s like a big sort of
band.
Devaney: You’re talking about you’ve got a line that is the fiftieth percentile for
salaries, and some are above and some are below?
Miner: [00:37:49] No. I’m talking about two lines, which is about one standard
deviation away from the middle.
[00:37:53] There’s the band of everybody in the middle, and then
there’s a bottom line where we actually don’t think anybody should be below
that.
Devaney: You actually had salary minimums and maximums for staff. Some of these
women and minorities were below the salary minimum.
Miner: [00:38:05] The typical pattern, this is everywhere. This is every institution I’ve
ever seen. This is faculty; this is staff; this is Wisconsin. The pattern, if there
were no intervention, it’s typically that the women and minorities are almost
all the people below the line. Below the bottom line, the least line, are
women and minorities.

94

[00:38:23] Almost all the people above the high line are white men, and
that is my point about this. It’s a very deep social pattern that replicates all
the time.
Devaney: Do you think that that pattern has anything to do with the training program,
the Tooth Fairy thing that you were talking about, that particularly women
think that if they do a good job, somebody’s going to notice them and
promote them, whereas men maybe are going to be trained to be a little bit
more assertive about asking for raises or threatening to leave?
Miner: [00:38:53] Great question. An exciting aspect of that time was those sorts of
questions were unanswered in terms of academic research. We didn’t have
the research to answer it, so we all were doing trial and error and learning.
We actually considered having assertiveness-training classes. We did have
assertiveness-training classes for women on the theory that we could correct
that [top down decision bias], but you’d really rather have the women also
pressing [for fair salaries]. The answer is that would be a Myra Strober’s
perfect question. Professor Myra Strober was an economics professor who
specialized in wages and gender.
Answering in detail your question, which was a causal question, what is
causing that [patterns in wage differences] has been what academic studies
have spent twenty, thirty years working on, and my own view is that it’s all of
the above. Certainly women, on average, were socialized to be less willing to
push. That was part of the same sex roles we’ve talked about. But as an
institution, we were saying that shouldn’t be the pattern, because that’s not
supposed to be what you’re paid for. That’s not part of your job description,

95

called “go in and ask for more salary.” We didn’t want a situation where there
were unbalanced salaries. The point of all this is that was a major focus for a
lot of studies, and some of these got done, but it also, I think, sensitized
people.
Devaney: In the six years you were there, what extent do you think salary equity issues
for staff were at least improved?
Miner: [00:40:27] Unquestionably improved. When I look in my heart, when I think,
“All those years when I wanted to change people’s souls and everything,
what did I really do that was worth anything?,” I think, “There are a bunch
of women in the world and some minorities who have money they would not
have had ever since 1972.” If I hadn’t pushed along with these other people,
it probably wouldn’t have happened.
Devaney: That’s great. That is a great sense of achievement that you could take with
you.
Miner: [00:40:51] I feel good about it.
Devaney: Let’s talk about higher-level positions. You’re now talking about staff, but
what about key leadership positions? What did Stanford do for affirmative
action in trying to find minorities and women for those jobs?
Miner: [00:41:07] As you may recall, I was put on [practically] every search
committee at that time, including the football coach, the basketball coach,
deans of engineering, deans of education.
Devaney: So your responsibilities, let’s just clarify, were just as much to represent
underrepresented minorities as they were women in that time. By
“underrepresented minorities,” you mean which groups?

96

Miner: [00:41:43] It changes with history, but at the time it was, as you pointed out,
Native Americans and what we then called Chicanos, which later branched
out because that was seen as too narrow, and even earlier, African
Americans. Those are the three groups. On these search committees, my role
was to help influence that, which would have included trying to help find
women and minorities, but also where I felt had more impact was--it was
exactly where things were.
We’re interviewing a dean and my job is going around the table, and
they expect me to ask about affirmative action, right? That’s where it was. It
was the advocate’s problem. The question would sometimes be, “Do you
believe in affirmative action?” Remember, it was still controversial.
Devaney: You would ask the candidate that?
Miner: [00:42:37] Yes. One, is the person themself a minority, but even more
important at that point was, what were they going to do. It’s tempting to
treat it like it was a matter of attitudes. Did they like women and minorities?
That was the implicit question. Are you mean-spirited? But part of what we
were doing then was teaching, we thought, a different approach where we
would say, “Give us examples from your own prior experience where you
have increased the number of women or you have worked with women and
minorities. They would say, “Oh, in my lab, I went and recruited black
scholars from Howard,” or the like. In that sense, I was participating in what
the institution wanted as diffusion of the skills and goals and trying to get
women and minorities in these roles.

97

Devaney: Were there any grievances? You were doing your best, but did you get
pushback from white males?
Miner: [00:43:36] They rarely came to me, the white males. Some.
Devaney: But was there pushback?
Miner: [00:43:41] Oh, sure, yes. You and I were talking the other day with another
person who was there at the time, and it made me remember or realize, I
think much more than I was aware of at the time, that a lot of men, white
men, were powerful. Carl Degler, who was a faculty member, male. He was a
professor of history. He became the first chairman of the Committee on the
Education and Employment of Women. He said to me one time we were
talking about all this, “Don’t forget,” because I was very cheerful and how
everything was great and the world was changing and all these men were for
it, because that’s all I was getting in my sampling, right? People didn’t come
up to me and say, “This is crazy,” or, “Don’t do this.” He says, “You’re not
in the room.” [laughs] He says, “There are many rooms you’re not in, and
you don’t have a sample of what they’re saying when you’re not in the
room.” It was his way to remind me that there was a lot of resistance that I
was not likely to be hearing directly.
But the fortunate thing was that that is one thing that a lot of people,
like the so-called good deans, Al Hastorf, whom I mentioned yesterday, and
Lyman or Miller, were resisting that. I know Lyman heard complaints,
because he would sometimes mention to me about that--that we’d gone too
far.
Devaney: Complaints from white men?

98

Miner: [00:45:05] Absolutely, and staff maybe even more than faculty. I mean, this is
kind of a silly speech, but it is almost impossible to overestimate the power
of fear in the workplace, right? It’s like when you have a reorganization.
Everybody’s afraid they’ll be gone. I mean, who would you fear if you’re a
white male? You’d say, “They’re going to get rid of my job,” and that’s how
they interpret it. You had to really work hard to clarify what was going on.
In terms of my own experience, most of the grievances I had, and this
was where we learned--and I did--enormous things about how we needed to
change, because a more typical case for me would be a woman or minority
who would come to me and say, “They’re not doing this right.” They were
heartbreaking cases, because sometimes the grievant had a point, and then in
some ways it wasn’t too hard. I would go and talk to the supervisor or
sometimes the faculty one I would talk to, Provost Miller or Artie
Bienenstock, who was the kind of faculty lead. Remember, as vice provost
for faculty affairs, he had the charge of the implementer on the faculty
affirmative action side. He got that role of implementing the
recommendation that the provost should have an academic woman do all
this. He took that job. I said there should be a job, and it was filled by Artie,
it wasn’t a woman, which was different from my early imagining. But it was
that job. The design was clear. It was a high-level person who worked for the
provost who would be in charge of implementing this two- or three-quarters’
time.
Devaney: So come back to those recommendations that you had made in 1971. How
many of them were actually implemented? Do you have a feel for that?

99

Miner: [00:46:54] I would say 80 percent were implemented.
Devaney: Which ones were implemented?
Miner: [00:47:01] The recommendation for a Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs was
totally implemented in terms of the structure that I had envisioned, which I
had created after talking to various people. It’s not like I was from outside. I
already knew that President Lyman and Provost Miller thought it was going
to work to have some kind of associate director to do this. I knew that
before I wrote this in there, but maybe they thought it was okay. Because I
had argued with them about it, and a big one was the goals and timetables.
My point is, most of these we did. In terms of the point of it, the
principle, you could say, “Well, it wasn’t a woman.” Maybe that mattered or
didn’t matter. It may have mattered to my life, but it didn’t matter
subsequently. But were they implemented well is a very different question.
Devaney:

You mentioned that people like Carl Degler said you don’t hear the
pushback because you’re not in the room. Do you think by having a man, a
white male, actually be the faculty affirmative action officer, he would be in a
better position to push back on these arguments?

Miner: [00:48:10] Yes, of course, and that was why, I may even have favored that
myself by then, because the woman or the minority was always perceived as
being an outside advocate in some sense who wouldn’t really deeply
understand the norms. No, it was a good move.
Devaney: Let’s talk about how old you were in this period of time. You were a young
woman here, and chances are almost all the men, white men, you were

100

dealing with were actually quite a bit older, which sort of exacerbates the
power difference.
Miner: [00:48:54] I was twenty-nine when I started organizing women on campus, so
I was thirty-one when I did the report on women. I was thirty-two when I
started the job of university affirmative action officer. Not too young, really.
Devaney: You felt comfortable in dealing with all these people.
Miner: [00:49:14] We’ve talked about it. I felt like I was at a county fair. This whole
thing was like, what, are you kidding me? What am I, little Anne Miner, doing
here in the president’s staff meeting every Monday morning?
[00:49:30] The president had a staff meeting every Monday morning,
and all of a sudden, having been a little person writing little tiny reports and
begging to get in somebody’s office, I’m there every Monday, and I can talk
like anybody else. He goes around the room, and I say, “No, I think our
policy should be such,” and I just found it hilarious and wonderful and fun,
that part. It was so like going to the movies or a county fair, because it wasn’t
just like reading one book, right? It was no matter where you went, there was
a whole new thing.
Devaney: Were you the only woman in the president’s staff meeting?
Miner: [00:50:04] No, there were several there. I think Sally Mahoney, the Registrar,
may have made those. I don’t think I felt a gender thing there so much.
There, I probably did feel more the age thing, that way.
Devaney: Come back then to talking about other key issues that you faced as the
university’s affirmative action officer. You mentioned just now childcare.

101

Miner: [00:50:29] Yes. The first thing I wanted to clarify was that I had a direct
personal responsibility around the staff program, and there we focused on
mobility, salary equity, and many other things. Then I had a generic one, one
of many issues that affected everybody, so that would, for example, be
childcare.
Devaney: You said you had the first responsibilities for staff employment, and upward
mobility. But the broader policies like childcare affected faculty as well.
Miner: [00:50:56] Correct. I had a role which was less clear. I mean, nobody told me
to do that. I never had anyone say, “I think next year you should do this
rather than that.” I was proposing that I would say, “Here are my priorities.”
Devaney: Did you get any kind of annual performance evaluations and goals for the
next year?
Miner: [00:51:18] No. I mean, it would have been a surprise. Who would have
expected that? But it’s the same issue, which is this kind of Darwinian
Theory, that if you want to be in this world, you shouldn’t need that. It’s too
top-down. Everyone is supposed to be an entrepreneur, and that was the
implicit culture.
Devaney: Do you think that was unique to Stanford?
Miner: [00:51:40] No, that’s higher education. That’s the faculty culture. I live in it
now. It’s like, “We’ll give you tenure if you can show us that you will in the
future create original scholarly research that no one’s ever thought of
before.”
If I could say to you, “Pat, what I want you to find in the next ten years
is x,” then you’re not creating original research. It’s exactly that norm, that

102

the premise is you’re supposed to discover and propose. That was the
culture, and I didn’t even notice it then. I now see it’s part of an academic
culture.
[00:52:16] I found it fascinating, and I did find it frightening, if you
want me to talk about that. There was a side of it which was sort of my Alice
in Wonderland feature. For some reason, Jing Lyman and Dick Lyman, the
president and the president’s wife--I think it was the President’s Office--sent
me a tree, a bonsai tree, as a present in celebration of something. Maybe we
had a compliance review that went well, I don’t know. That was great, and
then we had that in our house.
Devaney: Were you married by then?
Miner: [00:52:51] I was married by then. Around the same time as I became the
university’s affirmative action officer, somehow in my spare time I got
married to another Stanford employee in the Development Office., I did not
change my last name though, so] my name was different [from his last name.]
We would go to meetings and hear about each other without people realizing
that we were married. That was fun.
[00:53:13] I was married to David Glen, who was in the Development
Office. He stayed.
Of course he knew the Lymans, too, because he worked with them in
Development. For some reason, we invited the president and his wife to
dinner at our house in that period.
[00:53:32] It didn’t seem like a big deal too much until we realized-probably I realized--that I had killed [by neglect] the bonsai plant that was

103

sent. [laughter] That’s the point. I didn’t pay a lot of attention to the plant, so
I go over there and look, thinking, “Well, that’ll be great. I’ll put it on the
table.” I look and it’s this yellow, puny, withered thing where all that you
could see was this wire holding it. [laughter]
A sign of this issue of how we did feel like babes in Wonderland, which
we thought, “This is the worst thing that ever happened in our lives. How are
we going to do this?”
Devaney: The bonsai plant is dead, and they’re on their way to dinner. Did you go buy
another bonsai plant?
Miner: [00:54:16] We did. But it went on from there. I think you’re right. It mostly
felt like an apprenticeship. Do you know what I mean? I didn’t feel afraid,
and I don’t know why not, but I didn’t, because it was fun in a strange way,
and I believed in these things, so it makes it very easy to do when you believe
in it.
Devaney:

Before we leave your job as the affirmative action officer, would you talk a
little bit about the creation of the Center for Research on Women?

Miner: [00:54:48] We want to do that and childcare? Those would be the two.
[00:54:53] Childcare, it’s an odd issue, because if you say, well, it’s
about sex roles, you’d say, well, then we shouldn’t worry about it, because
that sort of says women [can] get ahead if you don’t have childcare. That’s
the pragmatic issue. In fact, women did have more responsibility for children,
so it did matter in terms of advancing women, and it was ideologically a huge
fight. I had senior officers explain to me that it was immoral for Stanford
University to get involved at all in childcare, that this is a private thing. It’s

104

like, “Should they buy your liquor? Well, no. If you want to drink, that’s
yours to pay for.” Similarly everything, not only childcare, but the cost of-Devaney: So, “If you want to have babies, that’s your business, but we’re not going to
pay for it.”
Miner: [00:55:45] That’s right. Their view was, “It shouldn’t be covered by
insurance. Come on. Are you kidding? If that woman wants to have that
baby, let her pay for it.”
These issues we see are still rippling through society today, and, I mean,
those are going back. The childcare one was totally that way. It had
tremendous advocacy [in favor of childcare however, which was crucial.] At
the SLAC group, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center group, there was a
woman named Glenda Jones who was a more aggressive advocate organizer
whom I knew from Women’s Liberation days. They had very effectively
lobbied and gotten some kind of support of SLAC. Then there was the Bing
Nursery School, but that was never designed to be childcare; that was
designed to be education. It was part of the Department of Psychology. You
could send children there, but it was an elementary school. But it was seen as,
well, why isn’t that childcare? Somebody would say, “Well, no, because that’s
not childcare. That’s academic research and a school.”
There was a phase where sympathetic people involved in Escondido
Village had a center. Escondido Village was the graduate student housing on
the Stanford campus that was tremendously relevant in terms of who was
affected by all this, all these married graduate students. They took a [general
purpose] room, but the people had to go in there and pick up the toys every

105

night, because it was really a room for meetings, but they were running a
childcare center. I don’t know what I was doing on this day, but they did a
sit-in at Pitzer’s office. Do you remember a child-in?
Devaney:

The married graduate students did a sit-in in the President’s Office at
Stanford?

Miner: [00:57:29] No, all the people. It was a women’s issue. Many people cared, and
I think it was the Escondido people, but I’m not dead sure. Someone
organized it. They organized a sit-in for Pitzer. I’m giving the history of
childcare, so I’m saying it’s bubbling up all this time [before I was formally
involved]. It went back a long way, but not much before ‘68, not before this
time we’re talking about.
Devaney: What is it exactly they wanted?
Miner: [00:57:54] That’s the point. If you asked one person in that group, they’d say,
“There should be free childcare for everyone. Duh.” There were countries
where that was the idea, that everyone should have this because it’s a citizen’s
right. Other people said, “No, that seems a little extreme. We don’t give free
anything to anybody. We’re a private institution,” [and so on].
So exactly what you said was what several senior officers said: “We
don’t even know what is the issue.” Somebody said, “Suppose there were
free childcare. What is this? Is this $2 million? Is this $1 billion?” Nobody
knew the price structure, and nobody knew what was good childcare, because
everybody thought that we probably wouldn’t want Stanford to be running a
childcare center where children were starving to death or whatever.

106

I actually heard a woman, I just remember being so outraged. A woman
on a panel about childcare who was an expert, because this was an advocacy
thing. But she was outside of Stanford. We were talking about the price of
childcare, and someone said, “Well, there are these really inexpensive places,
but they’re dangerous to the children.”
She said, “That’s too bad. The consumer should pay the price. If
they’re not willing to pay the price for childcare, then too bad.” I thought,
“Really? Are you kidding me?” Because it’s not the parents who paid the
price; it was the little children.”
The point of this long tale is that was a time that was very unsure, and
nobody agreed on what was the role of the university. Although the
university did, in fact, provide the space in Escondido or helped that happen
and did some things.
Devaney: But did they pay for the childcare providers?
Miner: [00:59:47] No. The principle then, which remained for a long time, was that
if there was going to be a center, it was like they’re not in the university
budget. They’re in a separate budget. The theory was if you want this is to
happen, then the entity has to be self-sustaining. We’re not going to run a
childcare center. And that was very deep.
This was an issue linked to the Faculty Women’s Club, which was a
most important positive factor for many years. They were running a
consulting service. They said, “Even if we built something, it’s not going to
be enough, so what people need is a way to find childcare.” This was Phyllis
Craig and Louise Wright. They were tireless. Phyllis Craig was a faculty wife,

107

a member of the Faculty Women’s Club, who finally [also] ended up giving
money to support childcare.
What I thought was the core problem to get solved was there needed
to be a public statement, as in the affirmative action report, that the
university intended or believed it had a role to facilitate childcare. I was
pretty sure that’s all we could do, actually, but that was going to be a huge
thing to do. There was going to be the fight, but I wanted something in
public--I didn’t want those senior officers to look at me and say, “No, this
should be like buying liquor.” Right?”
But there were all these questions. We hired Aimee Leifer, who then
was, I think, an assistant professor, a student of Eleanor Maccoby’s, or
maybe of Eleanor Maccoby’s husband, Nate Maccoby. Aimee had moved
from being a doctoral student who had previously worked on an admissions
study. Later she became the research associate who was paid to do the study
for me--the Leifer Report. I knew her because of Eleanor Maccoby and
because she worked on another study [with] me on admissions. The
[childcare] Report was paid, and it took a long time. It made people really
mad because it took a long time. It’s a 100-page report, it’s in the archives
somewhere, and it answered all the questions. How much will this cost?
What does childcare involve? How many people do you need? What is the
difference between a six-month-old and a three-month-old? What is the state
of things? I think I gave it to Miller.
Devaney: This is Aimee Leifer’s report, written under your auspices, that went to the
provost.

108

Miner: [01:02:44] I believe so. Probably sponsored maybe even by the provost’s
money. I don’t know [now]. It was totally successful in the sense of it was
accepted. The president and provost said, “Right. That’s the right policy.”
[01:02:58] The overall recommendation was that there should be an
active program to facilitate when possible. They should do that. So, issues of
space, if they could do it. What it said, it didn’t propose--it said it’s not ready
yet [for university subsidization]. But we knew this was all we could get. We
were not ready yet for the university to actually pay for the childcare itself.
Many people were very angry about it.
The people who wanted everyone to get free childcare were angry
because it didn’t go far enough. It didn’t say they should pay for everybody.
Others were shocked because it went too far.
I was annoyed at some people who didn’t even like the facilitating idea.
These were colleagues. This is inside people. I complained to some of them.
One of them--I don’t know who it was, and I don’t think it was me--said,
“Here’s an idea. What if we thought of things this way, that when you build a
new building, you create more problems with childcare, because there are
people there that don’t have childcare. [So funds should be set aside to
support cost of building new childcare for people in the building, or
elsewhere on campus.”]
Devaney: You mean the creation of the building creates the increased demand for
childcare because you’re hiring new people, some of whom are parents?
Miner: [01:04:39] That’s right, because another thing she [Leifer] had to assess was
what was the demand, which was the provost’s question. He said, “What if

109

there’s no demand? Nobody’s willing to pay for what it takes,” for example.
This laid out the demand in her report. I said, “A lot of demand is being met,
that’s true,” and they had a whole chain of childcare providers in Escondido
Village of graduate students. I thought that we should be spending money to
actually pay for these centers, to build new centers.
This [advisory] person said what you just said. There will be new
people if you build a new building. They need childcare. Now we’re making
the problem worse. We’re colluding with anti-childcare. What if we had a
policy which is that when you build a new building for $5 million, you have
to put X percent, some percent of the budget, toward having a childcare
center in that building, [or allocated to other childcare on campus] which was
a very popular view at that time. You should have the childcare in the
building. And that policy got approved.
We’d have to go look at the documents--not large amounts of money,
but there was some substantial amount of money that went to the childcare
center, the Stanford Community and Childcare Center, which by then did
exist, and they got their own money.
Devaney: Where was that? That was the actual physical facility? Stanford Childcare
facility?
Miner: [01:05:54] Yes, CCSC, Childcare Center of the Stanford Community. We’d
have to look at the history as to when this money was infused, but I know its
robustness, its ability to function was very positively affected by that money.

110

Devaney:

When did this childcare center at Stanford, the physical facility, actually get
started? Because we’ve gone now from facilitating it in Escondido to an
actual structure.

Miner: [01:06:20] I’m pretty sure the people who were running this center in
Escondido, as I remember it, became the founders of the CCSC, and what
they did was get a space that wasn’t in Escondido Village. It’s right near the
Credit Union building, close to Escondido Village. Still there to this day. It’s
still a major thing. They had an infant-care wing, which was in Escondido
Village.
Devaney: What you’re saying is that a policy was, in fact, implemented that for newbuilding construction, some portion of the building project would be set
aside for childcare, which, in turn, then was used to help subsidize the
Stanford Childcare Center.
Miner: [01:07:07] On the logic that if you weren’t going to put it in your building,
then you had to help the need be met. Parents paid almost all the portion,
but there was in some sense subsidy. It was maybe partly for the building. As
I said, this was a long time ago, but the important part of the story, from my
point of view--it was a lesson to me, too--was about watching someone who
was really gifted take something and say, “What do we want to really have
happen here?”
I think it may have been Sally Mahoney who said this. I don’t know
who did it. It was after Leifer wrote the report. The person said that we
should do something, basically, and then here’s all the need. Then after that,
the question was, what should we do, and there was a struggle because no

111

one wanted to spend real money. Then whoever it was thought of this idea
about the building, putting money in buildings, which was implemented. It’s
a case of instead of the institution tricking people by pretending to do
something good, so to speak, and not doing it, this was the opposite. This
was [spending real funds] in support of childcare without publicly admitting
that we were supporting childcare.
Devaney: You think that actually passed?
Miner: [01:08:17] I know it happened. You can read about that. But whether it’s still
there, I doubt.
[01:08:24] I just want to finish it, which is, the Leifer report was my work for
a long time, or to oversee that, and I did see it as one thing that I did that
was very important and kind of characteristic of this role. Eventually, when
you want to talk about running childcare, you need many people and all kinds
of expert knowledge. What my job was, is to catalyze something so that it
could get outside the [informal, advocacy parts of the] institution, which is
where it was, into the [formal, committed] institution where other people
would be the ones making it happen. I thought it was a success from that
point of view.
Devaney: Let’s go to the creation of the Center for Research on Women and what your
role was in that.
Miner: [01:09:06] Great. I can’t remember the very early ones, but it was in the early
stages--after the very beginning of the Affirmative Action program, so we’re
[talking about] after [there was community awareness and early hiring..]

112

We did hire more women. As you know, and there was a cohort of
women recruited to be in [schools] where they weren’t [there] before at all-business school, law school--and there were other active women. [There were
contested and intellectually challenging issues] like some of the questions
you’re raising: Is the reason that salaries aren’t the same because women
don’t ask for raises, or is that because men have a bias, an unconscious bias,
which is also probably true.? Nobody knew the answers to all this stuff, and
nationally everywhere there were women’s caucuses organizing, .e.g., in
sociology, economics. We knew that Stanford’s a research institution, so we
should be researching about that, and there were women who got together
and were supportive of creating--it had to be, because no one else is credible
of doing that, really, in the end. I’m not saying there aren’t researchers. There
are research associates, but if you want legitimacy-Devaney: You couldn’t establish a research center at Stanford that wasn’t led by
faculty.
Miner: [01:10:37] You could not. We’d have to ask Myra Strober in more detail.
Professor Myra Strober, the economist, was one of the early advocate
women economists. But we were talking about the structure, and I remember
going to Ted Geballe, he was a physics professor who ran a center called
something like physics for the future of the world. We went and we said,
“We want to create a center. How do you create a center?”
He said, “To create a center, what you need is a letterhead. That’s what
a center is.” [laughter] He was serious. He meant it in a sense that there are
centers that are more symbolic and that they’re a way to get money, right?

113

But we felt that other people didn’t see it the way we saw the need for
research on women. We thought that the issues to research women would
take the RAND Corporation. There were so many questions and such
important ideas that anybody could see this should be endowed at $100
million immediately. That’s how we saw it. I did experience the thing that
then you could feel your vision, this was not seen the same way by other
people, who thought it was mostly a justice question. It was just like there’s
been a little unfairness, we’ll stop that. Or is there really nothing too big
going on here?
Devaney: But why weren’t those kinds of issues already addressed in departments like
psychology and sociology?
Miner: [01:12:24] That’s a good question. There you have Eleanor Maccoby and
Carol Jacklin, who were doing research on gender questions. You had the
Bems. Do you remember the Bems, Sandra and Daryl Bem? I can’t
remember when they were hired. They were in psychology. There was Shelly
Rosaldo, who was a rock star in anthropology, who later died.
There were women who were doing things, but traditionally--this may
seem a little extreme since we’re trying to avoid generalizations what we
could call gender questions were not seen as important questions in most
fields, or the women weren’t there at all. Or another way to look, you think if
you’ve got a book in those days about the history of something, you would
look and in the index there might be no women or there might be an index
item called “women.” So women were like the opera. I mean, they were like a
subject, but they weren’t an important subject, and they weren’t normal. It’s

114

back to that question, “Who’s normal?” It’s like when I was in medical
school, literally we studied the human body, and then we studied the
woman’s body. [laughter]
The point was, at the time I generally believed--and I’m not so sure this
is true anymore--it could be that if we really included women in especially the
social sciences, that we would develop radically different theories, different
understandings. Sylvia Wynter, another important name, Professor Sylvia
Wynter, a black woman faculty member--I think she was in Portuguese
Studies. She was very creative, and she believed that about minority issues in
the social sciences, if we understood the processes that affected the fate of
minorities, it would actually change the nature of theories. It wouldn’t be just
like, “Now we understand how it works in Montana and yesterday we knew
Illinois.” It would be different theory. But that was the problem. That was, to
me, an important idea that maybe this would change the nature of the social
sciences, but you had to have a way for people to get together. So there was a
seminar. Myra Strober, I think, was the first head of that institute. I was
involved and I went to seminars.
Then in ’76, I believe--I don’t remember why these transitions
occurred, but Diane Middlebrook took over and then I was asked to join
Diane as the co-chair of that institute. For a few years, I was a co-chair.
[01:15:08] At the time, the institute was funded by university money,
some grants. In academia it’s a soft-money world, and maybe the university
gave us one academic administrative staff position. That might have been. I
don’t remember, but I do remember there was a woman in the Provost’s

115

Office in research administration who said, “The trouble with you people--.”
[laughs] Because by then I was going in with Diane, we’d go in together
about budget, and she’d say, “You just don’t get it. You don’t ask for enough
money. You’re too wimpy, and you’re not--.”. This person said that, which
was true, and we were not. But I was more skilled than Diane in asking.
That’s why they asked me to do that, I think.
Diane was an English professor, very talented, who said to me, “Anne,
I’m glad we’re working on this together, but you need to remember that I see
all administrators with a mixture of fear and contempt.” I found that
fascinating and totally helpful, because I realized she wasn’t just talking for
herself; she was talking for many faculty. So every time I talked to them, I’d
think, “That’s right. There’s that funny mixture.”
Devaney: What’s the fear about, that they could say no to you, and the contempt is that
you were below them in rank?
Miner: [01:16:40] The contempt is you’re not an intellectual. That’s basically it. But
surely you’ve witnessed that. The fear is that you have secret tricks and
sorcery and power that you will use to harm them.
Then there were all kinds of fun fundraising experiences, and she
[Diane Middlebrook] was very active in that. She would go out and do
seminars, the salon series in community houses, do a session on poetry. It
was like watching an institution learn how to fundraise, because it was all
about how to raise money. There were efforts to get large grants, and it’s not
that we didn’t know an endowment wasn’t a good idea, but it definitely never
got in the game of going up to the system and having the Development

116

Office believe that this was a prospect for a $5 million or $20 million gift. I
think that never happened [in that era]. It must have eventually happened.
But at the time, although I do have memos from maybe the
Development Office saying, “We’re having a visit today from the head of
U.S. Steel, and he says he’s interested in research on women. Come to
lunch.” It wasn’t as though there wasn’t effort, and it’s a mixture of our
effort and where society was whether we got the money.
Devaney: What do you think were the biggest achievements of the Center for Research
on Women while you were there?
Miner: [01:18:07] I think we made some headway on the institutionalization of the
[vision of the importance of research on women]--because we did have two
staffers. They hired Laraine Zappert or Marilyn Yalom at one time, so there
was now not just a secretary person, but a professional researcher, who were
both skilled researchers. I thin Laraine Zappert is still at the university--I do
believe I looked her up--a talented research associate, so she did work.
Devaney:

The Center for Research on Women was actually directed by a faculty
member. Now you had these two people who had PhDs who were doing
research themselves. And you had administrative staff, and the university was
funding some portion of this whole enterprise. This was considered an
independent center. It was separate from any particular school, right?

Miner: [01:19:10] Absolutely. We had on the board originally Eleanor Maccoby,
James March, and those people who gave time to make that happen. James
March is an influential faculty member. He was in sociology, education,

117

business, and some other place. He was a big-time guy. I think he was
education at the time.
Devaney: At one point I think you said you were a university fellow. Can you tell us
what that University Fellows Program was?
Miner: [01:19:59] The university had a major grant to, as I understood it, increase
basically citizenship, especially on the faculty, to see the university as a whole
and not in their own fields. That was my understanding. But it was a large
amount of money, and it was, I thought, a very well designed program. They
would buy out a faculty member’s time--I think it was a third of their time, a
third of their teaching.
It met every week when I was there, and it would meet in the
President’s Office and notably included quite a few minorities and women
faculty, because it was part of the idea of having women [and minority
development for leadership]. The faculty developed, I would say, impact or
perspective, but half the people were staff, so it was a mix. It was half faculty
and half staff.
Devaney: My recollection of the program is it was funded by the Ford Foundation, that
each fellow--there were a total of about twelve--half faculty, half staff, the
staff were chosen by the faculty, and the idea was to bring them together as
colleagues and friends over dinner in non-scheduled meetings where they
actually could get to know each other and they could interact between
disciplines, because they didn’t want the silo effect of people just sticking to
their own discipline. In fact, many really fabulous interdisciplinary programs

118

came out of that, with people talking to each other. You were an
administrative fellow chosen by the faculty one of those years. Is that right?
Miner: [01:21:30] I think I was chosen by the president, but I was chosen by
somebody. [01:21:33] But just to underscore that, yes, that all sounds right to
me, but there’s two different things. One is the chemist is talking to a
biologist, there’s that issue. The other issue is that the faculty, who typically
think only as a chemist and only as faculty, learn about things like tax policy
or whatever, so they’re learning from the administrators a different view of
the institution, particularly one that binds them to the institution of Stanford,
not to the profession of being a chemist, because they didn’t want to lose
faculty.
I went to that program. It was very educational and fun, and they had
incredible food and incredible money. But we also had a meeting at the time,
and one year Herant Katchadourian from the Medical School in the
Psychiatry Department, said something like, “This is getting boring to hear
about tax policies. Why don’t we each give our own intellectual biography.”
Every week I heard someone of those twelve people say, “Well, I grew up in
Texas, and I was a small, terrible person, and then I got my chemistry set.”
So you heard their journey of going from childhood to being a Stanford
faculty member.
I talked more about what we’ve talked about, the affirmative action
issues and how I saw it, but as I listened to the faculty, I had this
overwhelming sensation that until that very minute, that very half-year, I had
assumed that somehow faculty had a secret sauce--it’s like this royalty thing

119

again, that they had some bloodline that made them fundamentally different
from the rest of us and certainly from me. I think maybe William Massy was
one of them. He came after my talk [where I put up a little diagram on how
do you say what is best qualified person if there are two criteria?] [01:23:33]
So he says, “Do you realize what you’ve just put up there was exactly what’s
called a demand curve in economics? You’ve just kind of on your own
dreamed up something that is a well-known issue.”
What happened was, I thought, “Whoa. Not only am I not not like
these people, I’m exactly these people,” when they would describe their inner
life and how they looked at the world and how they would obsess and talk
too much. Their kind of mental description of how they entered the world,
which was to speculate all the time and think about things. That had a big
effect on me, coupled with the next thing I’ll talk about, in terms of making
me think about my own career and my role in higher education. Did I want
to stay doing what I was doing or, if I couldn’t be on faculty, maybe I should
think about that. If you’d asked me could I be a faculty member, up until
1972, I would have laughed. I’d said, “Who are you kidding?”
Devaney: Why did you hold faculty in such high esteem?
Miner: [01:24:37] The secret-sauce issue. I don’t know. When you’re a staff member,
there’s this kind of deference that you’re required to do, so they must know
something. I don’t think I had a clear view of it, but I just believed that was
true, and I certainly knew they had the power.
Devaney: You never aspired to that kind of a role before you became a university
fellow?

120

Miner: [01:24:55] Not at that point.
But in a similar era, we did have a research seminar at CROW, which
we thought was very important--the Center for Research on Women, that I
was not leading because I wasn’t a faculty member, but I did go to it because
I was a co-director. I went to a wonderful research conference out at Carl
Djerassi and Diane Middlebrook’s house in Portola Valley.
[01:25:21] Diane Middlebrook was my co-chair, and Carl Djerassi was
her significant other, who was a wealthy chemist who made money from
Syntex and was a Stanford faculty member in the chemistry department.
The point of this story is that in these seminars I would watch. Oddly
enough, in reflection, I think Eleanor Maccoby, her name always appears in
things, she’s just an interesting woman, she had some effect on me in terms
of the mixture of intellectual integrity. She was incredibly careful in what she
said, never said anything wrong. But she also was very angry at the
sociobiologists. She said, “That’s terrible. The whole field of sociobiology is
sexist.”
Sociobiology was a field that was becoming popular in biology, which
was profoundly sexist. I mean, it really was, and the whole field was. It wasn’t
like some people in it. I had never heard anybody say something like “so that
field is a mistake, and I personally am going to work with other women
intellectuals to influence the future of this field in universities.” I’m sure, if
she’s done an interview, she’s unbelievably polite, she’s a loving woman.
She’s mentored women I knew. But she was a fierce mind in this context.

121

Watching her, watching the women talk, and the readings, then I
thought not only maybe I could do this, but I see better what it means to be
a social scientist. That basically was modeling social science. That had an
effect on something we’ll come to next, maybe, which is why did I stop being
affirmative action officer and go back to graduate school, because I did.
There was a really simple conclusion, which I’m never sure I’m proud
of, really. I’m sort of ashamed of it. But I remember thinking overtly
something like, in the end, in a major research university--and this is actually
false, but that’s how I saw it--if you’re not a member of the faculty, you will
never have the intimate, ultimate ability to shape things, which is false.
That is wrong now, I know, as an organizational theorist, because there
were people who were not faculty who had enormous influence, way past
what is even acknowledged, by changing how things are happening, writing
rules, and helping people do things. At the time, I thought to myself, “I don’t
want to be here if I’m not a member of the royalty. If I’m going to stay
working, I have to either become a research person, a real one, or I’m going
to go into some other kind of institution.
Devaney: That’s really interesting, and I want to come back to that. But you basically
stayed on the job.
Miner: [01:28:09] Do you think this is shameful? Do you think it’s a shameful
thought?
Devaney: No. I think it’s completely honest, and it is your story, and it’s perfect
because it explains why you left your job in June of 1978 to go back to
graduate school in an entirely different field. But before we get into that, I

122

just want to kind of get a sense of the summary of what you felt were your
biggest challenges, biggest successes, any kind of huge confrontations that
you had, any things that made you really happy. When you look back on that
six years, what stands out?
Miner: [01:28:42] As I said before, oddly, the salary equity issues did, even though,
they also fall on both sides of the ledger. What happened, I thought, was
wonderful. On the other hand, in retrospect, it was a bare beginning, right?
We probably maybe got rid of some terrible inequities, and, as everywhere
else, it had to go on being re-addressed for decades, probably still now. I
guess I feel sad that we were naïve and didn’t understand, but I don’t think I
could have done it differently. If I had said, “Well, this really is a $20 million
job, and we should hire the RAND Corporation to do this data,” I think it
would not have happened. It’s not like I maybe could have changed it.
Devaney: But don’t you think Stanford and you were at the same place everybody else
was in society at that time, trying to figure out what the answers were?
Miner: [01:29:37] Yes. A little ahead, and from the legal people’s point of view, one
reason they liked doing it was, the Equal Pay Act says if you get caught
legally, if you have a lawsuit and you’ve discriminated, you have to pay back
pay. One advantage from their point of view to doing it voluntarily was you
weren’t being forced to do it.
Any lawyer would say that. In the world they lived in, there was an
advantage to doing it the way we did. Because they felt that way, and they
thought it was right and they thought it was smart, we did more on salary
than many places. This is one where Stanford clearly did not resist.

123

Devaney: You see Stanford as having been a leader in salary equity?
Miner: [01:30:24] Yes. Even though we didn’t do what I now wish we’d known how
to do. It was a lot of learning, but yes. I feel good about that.
Devaney: How well did Stanford do during the period that you were working in terms
of increasing the numbers of women and minorities?
Miner: [01:30:38] On the staff side, which I had much more direct influence over,
although it’s always an indirect role, it was, you’d have to say, some progress,
but not what you would hope at all.
We would annually report these numbers, and one thing I discovered,
which was a big shock, was how we were focused on recruiting, and we
actually did recruit a lot of women and minorities in higher levels, and we
definitely improved minority employment in the non-exempt areas, a lot of
work on that and things like policemen. You may remember Marv
Herrington. We had women and minority policemen way before most
universities ever heard of doing this about policemen. Marv Herrington was
fabulous on this topic. He was the chief of police, and he did things that no
one was doing.
Devaney: He was succeeded by a black chief of police, who then was succeeded by a
Stanford graduate who was a woman, but that’s an aside.
Miner: [01:31:43] Yes, but what we’re saying is “Was there headway?” There was
symbolic headway, which you might put the police department in. That was
very important.
[01:31:50] Then there was numerical headway in a general sort. It was very
good, it was right. It was not a comfortable world where you just might walk

124

into a room and staff with senior people but not be surprised to see a bunch
of women and a bunch of minorities. It was still a little deviant to be either
woman or minority at most senior levels--I’d have to ask you when this
period was. The big flip that happened was many women who would not, in
my view, have ever moved past some kind of secretary/administrative
assistant or low-level staff, junior staff role, were elevated and became the
men who hired them. That’s the Pat Devaney, Associate Dean of Research,
and Kathy Ku who runs the Office of Technology Licensing. Previous to
this era, I don’t believe she would ever become the head of Technology
Licensing, but that was part of that same era, that the people who had power
said, “Well, okay, I’ve got this great person.” I think Amy Blue, who became
the associate vice president for facilities did come in that era. And Margaret
Ann Fidler was associate dean of students. Carol Dressler was the associate
director for development.
[01:33:23] Out of that period, so it happened more with women who
were sort of there, although they were relatively young. It wasn’t perfect. You
did have people who ran the Placement Center--what was her name? [Ruth
Schneider] Wonderful woman. There were other cases where the older
woman who was there before didn’t get much reward, and then young bright
males would come in and get more. Definitely headway was made, not large
numbers, though, in terms of the management in higher levels.
Devaney: But you are saying you felt good about salary equity having made some big
progress. Some women got promoted from what was non-exempt clerical,

125

administrative positions into mid-management, higher-level management
positions.
And policy changes. What policy changes do you think were
implemented during that time that actually, in retrospect, mattered a lot? Like
childcare issues.
Miner: [01:34:29] We didn’t get to the faculty one. Let’s do the faculty one and then
we’ll do the policy. The faculty side I had less direct control over because an
important thing to notice is that as with anything that is working, it pervades
all parts of institutions. Whereas I had a list in 1971 of, I believed, every
woman, every person--not just women--on the Stanford campus who was
willing to say, “This is important. We should do something about this.”
Every one.
[01:34:59] It wasn’t a very long list but by this time, no one could have
that list because we have hundreds and thousands of people. When you have
a social movement and you succeed, then you no longer can control it, so to
speak. There isn’t a little tiny cohort, because it’s now everybody. Then the
diversity of the institution gets reflected in the “everybody.”
Devaney: Your influence is felt in the fabric of the institution in so many ways, but you
can’t necessarily pinpoint any particulars.
Miner: [01:35:28] Or the movement’s, right. Then specialization starts to matter. The
person like me could talk with women faculty about their problems saying we
should fix the nepotism [policy]. I mean, we were all smooshed together. It
didn’t matter. By the end, they had to organize and mostly as faculty, because
it was their constituency. The women faculty understood the details of the

126

tenure policy. They needed to be advocates. I could come in periodically, but
it becomes like it’s a medical field. At first everybody does everything, but
eventually you’ve got an ear doctor that only does ears. That, too, happens.
On the faculty side, I had less micro involvement, but in terms of
numbers, as I look back, it looks to me like what happened--and I don’t
remember being totally aware of this at the time, but it was big--(even though
it was in the center reports, it was all big public and there were big fights over
it, but basically there was a lot of success in the very beginning in the
numbers game for women, and then it plateaued. Then there became many
exchanges between how come there wasn’t a lot more progress. Or that was
a big jump in the very first year or two, and then it didn’t happen. Similarly
with minorities, it was pretty stable.
[01:36:49] As I said the other day, that’s a great example of how you
don’t always understand the system you’re in, and that’s what I do now. You
have to understand. I love organizational systems and I find them interesting.
This was a great example of we’re driving the car down the road, we think we
know what the levers are that make things happen. Yet what we really
underestimated was what you might call the demographics of affirmative
action. You never get that base number up if you can’t stem people leaving,
and that was true for faculty and staff.
I mean, if you suppose there’s 28 percent women in a field who are
candidates, and suppose they’re all equal, and you were hiring none, and then
you say, “Great. Now we’re hiring 20 percent,” you’d think that would be

127

good, right? If you only have two openings a year, you could do that for
twenty years and never get to 20 percent in the base.
We knew about that and we were constantly educating about that,
because Stanford’s very tenured. But what we didn’t know about, or what I
didn’t understand, was if you’re hiring 20 percent women a year, or hiring 20
percent minorities, because this was a problem for us in minorities, even if
you hired more than that, if you’re losing 15 percent every year, you never get
anywhere.
Devaney: You’re saying turnover had not been taken into account in affirmative action.
You didn’t look at the fact they were going to leave, you just looked at
incoming.
Miner: [01:38:17] We didn’t really understand that, nor does the public, nor did
anybody else in thinking about it, because it’s why aren’t there 20 percent
people in the base, and we even practically didn’t realize that. That’s why if
you ask me doing things again, I didn’t understand that until quite near the
end because of something that David Hopkins did. He was with the
Academic Planning Office, did a lot of work with Bienenstock, but also with
me later.
I would have done something different on minority hiring around that
issue. We would not have lost Ruth Mogadon to Hewlett-Packard. We would
have stopped that kind of thing, because that killed us. We never got the
critical mass because we lost people. She was a Chicano woman in the
Personnel Office who was [very] competent. We became like the supplier to

128

the local companies. We would hire people and then they [local companies]
would come recruit them away.
Devaney: You could say in broader social terms that’s good for society, not to just have
them at Stanford but to have them, in fact, in all different employers.
Miner: [01:39:19] Yes, it was. True. But it hurt the-Devaney: It hurt your numbers.
Miner: [01:39:26] It hurt more than that, we really keep talking about the numbers,
but the numbers are not the deepest issue and it doesn’t even help to fix the
numbers if you don’t get the culture changed broader, and that’s why
diversity is a better way to look at it. If you say, are we just trying to stop
being bad people and having bad jobs for women and minorities, then that’s
one thing. Or you say, no, we really believe it’s a better institution if we have
these different groups who are part of the “in” group. So we couldn’t get that
part of the “in” group done at that time, in my opinion.
Devaney: Do you think it’s happened since?
Miner: [01:40:03] I don’t know the culture at Stanford, but it looks from the outside
like much more--even what you just told me, the police chief, coaches, and
so on. But you’d have to actually look at who’s running the Accounting
Office, and all that. It’s a whole different issue. But the thing I’m saying now,
if I’d understood that then, I would have made it a policy issue. I would have
gone to the vice president and said, “If we want to get what we want, which
is the actual change for us, it’s one thing we want, we’re going to have to do
something about retention.” That did nationally become understood about

129

women, but a long time afterward. We were on the question of what would I
do different or how did it work.
Devaney: Do you have any further reflections on the job you did or on what happened
on Stanford while you were there, not just the job you did?
Miner: [01:40:56] You and I have discussed the question of reversibility or not. I do
believe that that period, ’71, ’72 through when I left, was a sea change. It was
connected to a lot of other things in people’s minds, and I was part of that. I
guess I’ll end with this. Part of what I did had nothing to do with me, or even
when I did, I could have sat in my office, locked the door, and it would have
had a certain amount of effect. There was a symbolic impact to Stanford
giving legitimacy to all of these issues and to my going places, going to
alumni groups and giving talks about this, that was part of the water on the
stone of changing the whole culture. I think it worked. It didn’t penetrate the
most inner core of society, obviously, because it still hasn’t, but it clearly did
change Stanford’s culture in ways that were somewhat irreversible in general.
The problem is for every one like that, there was a guy putting up a poster in
the steam plant of a naked woman. This is all going on at the same time,
right? [laughs]
[01:42:10] You needed it. Lyman had a wonderful remark he made
about that. I’d have to think, but the basic implication was it’s well and good
to intend well and have many things in place, but it’s more like carpentry or
hard work and it takes endless attention to detail and it will go on. That’s
how I saw it. So, yes, I thought we made some great progress, and I was
happy to be part of it.

130

Devaney: You left in June of 1978, and you said a little bit earlier about one of your
motivations to go to graduate school, which you did at that time. You went
back to graduate school to get your PhD, this time not in medicine but in
business at Stanford. Was that experience as a university fellow instrumental
in that decision?
Miner: [01:43:02] Absolutely. Along with being part of the CROW seminar, it was.
But the interesting thing is, to me, when you ask the question on the reason
when I went to study, it was how do organizations work? The reason I
studied was that as I’m watching all this go on, I realize the problems, many
of the issues to do affirmative action for minorities and women weren’t really
[only] about minorities and women. Some are, but more it was about “How
does any organization like Stanford change?” period. I thought to myself,
“They must know the answer to that.” Somebody who’s an academic.
[laughter] I’m a little bit making fun of myself, but it’s not totally false, right?
I said, “I’m going to go and learn. There must be a theory about
[organizational] change in general,” which, of course, there is. There are
hundreds of them. But I thought I should learn that. Where do they have
that? In sociology, political science, and sort of psychology.
I knew I wanted organizations, and I knew James March of the faculty,
and I knew, I think, Dick Scott in sociology, for reasons I can’t recall. We ran
seminars at the time on women. But so I said, “I need to be a social scientist
where they study organizations.”
I might have done sociology, but Dick Scott, the sociologist, said,
“Don’t do sociology because there’s no jobs.” Where there will be jobs is

131

another demography question, right, in universities? “Where there will be
jobs is business schools. If you got a PhD in business, you’ll get a job right
away, and that will not be a problem.”
So I did that, but I also did it because I knew in business I would have
to take math and economics in ways where I could no longer be seen -- or
actually be -- kind of a “hot-tub touchy-feely” woman who could do
wonderful verbal things but couldn’t do the math. I knew as an academic that
I wanted to be as powerful and credible as could be, and then I had to do the
math. The business school allowed me to do all that, and it was a great
program.
Devaney: You eventually had a child and separated from your husband. How did it feel
to become a student again, and a single mother?
Miner: [01:45:29] It was exciting, it was eye-opening. I remember standing in line as
a student and thinking, “Why is this happening to me?” That I didn’t know
anything. Because I was working in employment all this time, I didn’t know
anything about how graduate aid worked, and I would have all these struggles
with how to survive as a student. I remember being in the graduate student
lounge in the basement, and it was about 150 yards from my previous office
in the business school, sitting down there having tea with these other
business school students, and I’m not more than a football field away from
my office, and they would be talking about something, and I’d go, “Did you
notice that Encina Hall got a new roof? “
[The other students would say: “What a stupid roof,” or, “They don’t
know what to do with that roof.” I would then say something like, “No,

132

actually, the roof policy is--,” [and fill in specifics about that policy].
[laughter]
There were two things that happened. One is they’d go right on talking,
and I would say, “No, you don’t understand. I actually am an important
person, and I know things about the roof policy.”
It was very illuminating, too, in that I realized some of what I was used
to in the world at that time came from having a title called “assistant to the
president.” When I walked in a room, if I said that about the roof to some
unknown administrator that didn’t know anything about me, they would sort
of say, “I don’t know. Maybe this person [Anne Miner] knows that. They’re
from the President’s Office.” But in this context, I was an old woman.
[01:47:04] I was thirty-eight. I was old. They don’t admit people--these
are all twenty-three-year-old ex-physicists, and these are like little twentythree-year-old Scandinavian white male mathematicians.
Devaney: How many women were in your first-year class?
Miner: [01:47:19] Maybe two. That wasn’t too bad. We were sort of deviant, but they
were determined that not be an issue. We only had four people in a cohort in
our specific department. It’s a different world. It’s a tiny individual world.
Devaney: No, I mean, in the total first year PhD program, how many were there?
Miner: [01:47:39] In the management group, I say two or three, but in the total
group maybe fifteen, smaller. There might have been four women. There
were more in my group but it wasn’t too many spots. There were all kinds of
illuminating things.

133

The mother part [of the experience] was probably more coherent in
terms of what we’ve been talking about, because I had a child during my
dissertation process. I’m trying to think when it was. I defended my
dissertation proposal when I was eight months pregnant. It’s one of these
things where if [I’d really] known anything about the world, I [might] never
have done any of this. I knew nothing. I didn’t realize how crazy that was.
That wasn’t really done, and I did it wearing this stupid gray top. [laughs]
[01:48:31] And I remember the pants, and I remember there were forty
people there [at the proposal defense]. I don’t know why we were doing that
kind of defense, but I’m up there presenting my study and all this stuff. In
retrospect, I would have to say it was a very welcoming environment, and the
women staff treated me differently once I was pregnant. They would say,
“Anne, come on in my office.”
I’d say, “What is that?” I thought maybe they’d help me with my
financial aid. They said, “No. I want to talk to you about breastfeeding.”
[laughter] Shoot. Nobody ever did that in my whole life. It was very
supportive in that sense.
But what was harder, or sobering in a way, was the childcare issue, in
that now I’m living in Escondido Village [separated from my husband] and,
especially, I’m working on my dissertation six days a week. Six days a week
and probably five nights a week I’m working on it. My child is in the
Stanford Infant Center and, of course, I’m [helping] raise money [for the
center], and I can’t not continue as an administrator, so I’m consulting with

134

the Center and raising money for the Center and facilitating retreats and
stuff.
Devaney: You’re just doing that because you can’t let go of being part of the Stanford
administration? [laughs] You were more powerful in that position. You’re
now back to being just a mere graduate student.
Miner: [01:49:56] I’m used to that. I think that was a large part of it. It was way
easier to write the [fundraising] pamphlet than to work on something on my
dissertation where I was a complete infant. That’s the whole point of the
dissertation is to force you to this ultimate pathway of independent original
research, so it had to be mine. I mean, there’s no way you can get help.
Then I remember looking back and thinking about what was Anne
Miner doing, because the old Anne Miner thought she did a lot about
childcare but they were so modest, relative to the actual impact of childcare
on lives and people, that I felt I didn’t really understand it [childcare] at all
when I was promoting it [in the years before]. It was an abstract thing for me
[before]. Now it was my whole life. Everything that mattered to me
depended on the quality. I had to know that my child was safe. For me it was
also learning. I didn’t have a lot of grandparents, so I was learning how do
you take care of a baby, for heaven’s sake. I remember just musing about
how innocent I had been before, and I didn’t do anything wrong before, but
I didn’t understand really how profound it was, and I became more of an
advocate, probably for its importance to people being able to do both.
There was another woman who had a child the same age, and we
basically shared parenting. We both took care of two babies all the time,

135

because we were both doctoral students doing that. That was sort of seeing
the same issue from another viewpoint. It made Stanford look good that we
had the Infant Center and we had the Childcare Center.
Devaney: You had actually put those things in place, and now you’re able to take
advantage of them. How was the business school different from the medical
school? I know there were many years’ difference between your experiences.
What was the difference in the cultures?
Miner: [01:51:59] That’s a great question. In some ways, not too different, very harddriving, smart, aggressive, ambitious people. I probably shouldn’t say, but I
think as a person, as a student, each case, it’s the same issue. There were
always men and women who had empathy. They weren’t just sort of
generally for it, they actually understood. [In the Medical School world] there
was a guy named Rudy Moos, who I worked for in the medical school [at the
Veteran’s Administration building], who was doing work on twins with
arthritis. And then Herb--I’m going to get them mixed up. Herb Leiderman,
he was a psychiatrist doing infant research. They were wonderful people, and
they were creative. They were supportive, so I was involved in psychiatry,
and they were helpful. One guy [Joe Hanlon] tried to get me to go with him
when he went to another institution to study organizations and stuff like that,
and the same in the business school.
There was also then an undercurrent of what we talked about before,
that it was still primarily men, and in the Stanford business school there were
still things, and this was hard. Like in the set theory class, very hard class,
very math-oriented class, the guy would talk about women, numbers as

136

women. He’d say then the number she or something. It was very sexist. It
was like it had something to do with genitalia. I would get stuck in this
setting, thinking, “Now, if I had my affirmative action hat on, I would do
something here, because this is ridiculous,” but nobody was paying me to do
that, right, and I was worried about looking too outspoken. Sometimes I
didn’t do anything, so I just let it go by. Sometimes I did [speak up].
Devaney: It didn’t matter that you had been Stanford’s first full-time affirmative action
officer. You’re now a student, and you, in fact, were trying to minimize that
role or at least not try to exploit it, because they didn’t care?
Miner: [01:54:19] No, it’s more like it was still an era where there was mixed feelings.
Some very sympathetic men who often were married to professional women
who were for it. But there were other men who were still worried, and people
who saw you as being too aggressive if you raised that problem, if you
brought it up, went out of your way, they said. This is still a problem now, I
think--”Just have a sense of humor. What’s the matter with you? This is just
some dumb guy in a class that didn’t matter, so why are you so bent out of
shape?” As people do now, I had to just walk a line and be careful about
when I did or didn’t bring it up, and that was a surprise to me. Generally,
they were like society. They were everything that had everything, some
supportive, some not, and there were women when I was there.
Devaney:

What was the subject matter? What was the title of your dissertation?

Miner: [01:55:16] My dissertation was called “The Strategy of Serendipity,” which is
the strategy we’ve talked about a lot in terms of making change. A lot of the
things we did were opportunistic, you know. The Committee on Women was

137

because the Student Union president happened to be on the committee so
we could write this thing. That happens, and that was actually a style that I
believed in, that you can’t do everything. It actually was a dissertation about
creating jobs around people, idiosyncratic jobs. So the job was never there
before, but there was Pat Devaney, and she had these talents, and we said,
“Well, let’s just make up a job, which is what she does,” which, of course, I
saw all the time, a big problem in affirmative action. [laughs] It’s how you
handle that. I wrote a dissertation on that. I wrote it, but the final point I
need to make is it really wasn’t a change in direction at all. It was more like
I’m now permitted, encouraged to think about, without having to fix them,
how these change processes are working or how process is going in terms of
hiring people in organizations. [The] dissertation basic argument was
something like [this]: organizations face all kinds of uncertainties that they
actually cannot plan for. There’s a limit to what you can plan for. And one
thing they do is they’re opportunistic in job creation. There never was a job
position. Now, you can read the entire sociology literature, I’m not kidding
you, at that time, and most management literature, and you would conclude if
you were from Mars that all jobs were imagined in principle and then
someone went out to find the person to put in that job. Really.
Then there’s like this sort of secret. People laugh if you say, “Yes, but
my mother, you know, in her case, they made up a job for her.” Everybody
snickers, because it defies some icon we have, but everyone knows at some
other level, don’t they? That let me write something that had an effect on the

138

sociology literature, because it said the whole literature is missing this piece
that everybody knows, but it’s not in the scholarly work.
Then theoretically my argument was that this may be a bad thing, but
often it’s used as a way to adapt. For example, our Stanford computer
support group. Because I did the research at Stanford, the computer guy
would say, “If people can’t make up their own next job, then we don’t want
them.” They had a system, which [was] “this [a] complicated world, too many
things to do, so we expect the person to be able to figure out what is the
most important problem, and then they propose that as a job.”
My dissertation, basically, took that simple idea and said okay it’s a way
of adaptation to uncertainty and ambiguity and so forth and power. That was
the dissertation.
Devaney: It was significant. It had an impact in the whole field.
Miner: [01:58:17] [laughs] Less than it might have, because I didn’t follow up with
further research on that so it might have had more, but it was published in
the top sociology journal in the country, one paper like that, and one was
published in the top management journal in the country. In that sense it did.
Devaney: What year did you get your PhD?
Miner: [01:58:40] Eighty-five. Then I went on the job market to get a job.
We should mention one other thing here. The other thing I did as part
of getting the PhD is I had watched some faculty and I said, “That’s the way.
That’s the kind of thinking I want to do.” I talked to them. I said, “If I do
this, will you be my dissertation adviser?” That was James March.
Devaney: If I do this project?

139

Miner: [01:59:09] Get a PhD. No, if I go and become a doctoral student, because I
didn’t want to be bad at this, and you could see that. The other was Richard
Scott in the sociology department. They both said yes, and they both were on
my committee.
I had an idea of not just particular theories, but a way of being in the
world. They were both people who did not teach about organizations as
though they are a simple machine where you just have one person in charge
and they design it and it happens, because all that interested me was the fact
that’s not how it works, that it emerges in these very amazing ways, and that’s
what I want to understand.

Devaney: Hi. This is Pat Devaney interviewing Anne Miner. It’s the third session of
our interview as part of Stanford’s Oral History Program. Today’s date is
June 28, and we’re sitting in my kitchen today.
Anne, in our previous two interview sessions, we talked about your
education at Stanford and your work as an affirmative action officer and then
your graduate training at the Stanford business school and your PhD. You
left Stanford what year after you finished your PhD? And then where did you
go?
Miner: [00:00:34] I left in 1985 and went to University of Wisconsin, Madison. I
started as an assistant professor at age forty-something, three or four. So that
was an oddity too. I was very old compared to most assistant professors.
Devaney: That’s interesting. How did that feel?
Miner: [00:00:57] It felt fine, but you could tell the system was not set up for that.
We haven’t talked about that, but that was another oddity in my career, very
old to start as an assistant professor.
Devaney: In your previous jobs at Stanford, you’d been senior staff, and now you’re
going back as a forty-three-year-old as an assistant professor. How many

141

other women were on the faculty of the business school at that time in
Wisconsin?
Miner: [00:01:28] On the faculty of the business school at the University of
Wisconsin, about seventy or eighty Academic Council tenure-track people,
roughly, and there was one woman who’d been hired about two years before
me. There had been a woman in the 1940s, but in terms of the modern era,
there was one before me.
Devaney: Do you think it actually helped to be a little bit older then, coming in as a
junior faculty member?
Miner: [00:01:50] It helped me survive, yes. We’ll get to this more, but all of my
knowledge and theory about how this all worked was extremely helpful
because it made sense of things that otherwise didn’t make sense.
[00:02:14] But in general, it probably was not a big deal one way or the
other, but it was definitely a period where it was different to be a woman.
We’ll talk some more about that.
Devaney: Did it feel any different being a woman in a predominantly male field as a
faculty member than it did being a woman staff member in a predominantly
male field? I mean, was the difference between faculty and staff?
Miner: [00:02:35] That’s a really good question. I remember thinking that it was. The
principal thing, to get this concrete, was that by the time I left Stanford, I was
surrounded and I functioned in groups where they weren’t all men. I mean, I
did know Myra Strober. I did know many women faculty and women
students at Stanford. Also even the President’s Office culture by that time
had worked through a lot of the little micro issues about, what is it, should

142

you tell a sexist joke at a staff meeting? The answer is no. But at Wisconsin,
Wisconsin was a school that had been actually quite a bit ahead of some
things at Stanford. They actually helped write the guidelines for women in
higher education. They were very active, a lot of protests. As an institution,
University of Wisconsin, Madison is a very progressive and radical place, so
they had done a lot of things at the same time. But that doesn’t mean all parts
of the institutions were on the cutting edge. The business school in
particular, was like walking back twenty years.
So many things that happened there when I’m arriving as a new
assistant woman professor, they were exactly the same things that had come
up in 1969 at Stanford. But they hadn’t happened there yet, so it was the first
wave thing. I was the first wave, so then you get all these questions like,
“Should I open the door for you or not?”
More to the question you actually asked, I remember many things,
almost laughing and thinking all that time I was studying faculty processes
and cultures, and I would write about them and say, “Well, you can’t do this
because the faculty department chairman doesn’t have that kind of power.” I
mean, I knew these things in my mind, sort of like the daycare thing, but
when I was actually in it, I would go home and laugh and think, “This is way
more a different world than I ever really understood.” Especially the things
like authority, that in a sense it’s like there’s somebody in charge. We had
twelve people in our immediate department, in the Management Department
at Wisconsin. You’d go to a meeting and grasp what the many features of the
whole [faculty] world are because it’s not the same kind of formal authority

143

coming down from the top. It’s constant, the more political thing. And it’s
both collegial and hierarchical. It looks like a hierarchy, but the actual power
is more collegial. The upside of that is it’s wonderful if you believe in that,
and it’s good, because everybody has to agree before you go forward. But the
downside is that there are political problems that never get resolved, because
no one could come in and say, “Stop it, children.” It’s not there. Things like
that I had to really grasp how different it was, that it’s a very social process
and very deliberative and things go on forever and ever. It was different.
Devaney: Do you think that depends on the discipline?
Miner: [00:05:40] Not too much, because, as I didn’t talk about before, but I
remember giving a seminar at SLAC, the Stanford Linear Accelerator, here,
and they were all scientists there, the whole seminar. This was when I was
new to my Stanford job, and I just went home and sort of fell over because I
couldn’t believe the degree of argumentative stuff. [laughs] Everybody
challenged everything. Everybody was unbelievably rude, from my point of
view. But I could see that had nothing to do with affirmative action anyway.
It was just how they did things. How they interacted. That tone of challenge
everything, question everything was something that I think pervades all
academia, and should, but it’s different than the normal life.
Devaney: What influence do you think that your years at Stanford in affirmative action
had on your later career as a professor?
Miner: [00:06:33] What it did was it was like there were many things I understood
that were very helpful, like how these processes work, so in that sense it was
good because it was like a preview. I was thinking about, what was the

144

situation, say, in the business school at that time, and it was like there were
three different things going on. One was there were some people, as I said
before, where it was back to the consciousness-raising era we talked about
before--1969, 1970--where there were really questions about “should you
open the door.” Or, for example, there was the other woman. I did talk
about what is the climate like and what’s the story here about hiring, because
there’s still a question how to encourage more hiring of women. We were
back to that topic.
I remember we were sitting in a little conference room having tea one
day, and the door was open, and a perfectly nice friend of both of us walks
by, sees the two of us talking, and says, “What are you two plotting? What
are you plotting?” Because it was so weird, from his point of view, to have
these two women, that if they were talking together--. We didn’t even have a
sign up saying “Women’s Forum” or anything. We were just talking. We were
probably talking about parking or something. But his immediate reaction was
it was part of the bra burning, that we had to have some grievance, which we
didn’t have..
All those things were just like the same type. By then, of course, we
would laugh about that, both of us. We didn’t worry about it because we’d
seen that before a hundred times, and that’s all going on. That was helpful to
have been through that.
There were also some surprising residual instances of what is clearly
bad behavior and shouldn’t be tolerated. For example, in my own area, there
was a very senior person who was very good, very important. He was really

145

important. A man who was an important coach for many people, and he
presented this kind of puzzle where, on the one hand, he had on his desk
where he met with students--I mean, it’s not like just the younger faculty had
to deal with this--copulating pigs, a little statue. A little tiny statue of two pigs
having sexual intercourse. Every time you went to see him about your
progression analysis, you’re looking at the copulating pigs. [Devaney laughs.]
But that’s not so bad for us, right? I mean, I was a grown woman, but I’m
thinking in my head, I’m thinking somehow we also have-Devaney: It would be very off-putting for young students.
Miner: [00:09:16] For undergraduate majors, this is ridiculous. He also had a poster
that was similarly a joke, but it was clearly sexual.
Devaney: Let’s just stop for a second and mention the fact that at the University of
Wisconsin business school, you teach undergraduates as well as graduate
students.
Miner: [00:09:33] We do. Good point. Our largest program has hundreds and
hundreds, maybe a thousand undergraduate students. We were more like
Humanities and Sciences in that sense, a very big part of the undergraduate
[curriculum]. There was that kind of thing going on, but at the same time,
that same man had recruited more women graduate students into our field. It
was this bizarre combination of sexist nonsense, but he actually was very
good at mentoring women. One of his students later became, for example,
the editor of the top journal in my field. You had to deal with it.
But the good thing is the Stanford experience did help me have a
framing for all that, to not take it too seriously, and to be able to focus or try

146

to focus on what does it have to do with my scholarly development, and to
only interact or to deal with it without attempting to change the whole
institution.
But I would say that the final thing, the most common, were those two
things. One was kind of everybody, including women, not knowing how
should this be working. And there were [also a] few actual bad behaviors that
should have been censored, and actually in that case he was. Eventually the
dean of the school did not give him an award that he hoped to get because of
that behavior. In a sense, the system worked. I didn’t fix all that.
The dominant thing was, what I would say, everybody trying to learn
“what did this mean to have women?” So that was the approach we took,
and as it went on, more women were hired. We did repeat many of the things
at Stanford, and I did use my experience. We had a faculty women’s group
that met and talked about this question. There were really still, back to these
family questions. A related one is sick children, sick family members, right,
what is that about that?
Devaney: What do you mean about that, you mean what kind of leave policy issue
would there be?
Miner: [00:11:31] Things like childcare. I did have that [the question of childcare and
child health] in my family, but also other people did, and often, again, this
could be a man who says, “My child has neurological something, so I want to
get an extension of my tenure clock.” But it’s more often women. I saw that
part, and when I was there, that was worked out, so it’s like the organization
was learning.

147

My friend, who was a dean in another school, said to me, the old
system was that it was an old-boys’ club in a way, but it was more based on
scientific merit. But still they would say, “Well, Bob has a sick child, so we’ll
find a way to send him off to somewhere else so he’s got a little more time to
accrue publications, and that’ll help him get a record that’s tenure-able.”
The tenure process, just to remind ourselves of that, is one that at most
places is six years, and if you look at it as a game, you have six years to score
some number of goals. In my field, it’s probably five goals. You have to have
five A-journal publications--highest-level journal publications of different
schools. But that would be similar to Stanford’s, not exactly the same.
The point was that during that time, several cases came up and the
school finally got, with pressure from the university, to say, “ Okay, really,
that should be everyone’s right, that if you have that kind of demand on your
time, then we should give you this extra time on the clock.” That did occur in
my case. [It also] occurred in [the case of] a woman who had children. She
got divorced, but the result was her children had psychiatric care and she was
going every day to take these children to the psychiatrist. We wrote [a letter
to the higher level body that approved tenure clock issues] and said that’s like
a physical disability, you should extend her clock by six months, a year, and
we did.
Devaney: In other words, when you say “extend the clock,” what you mean is you’re
extending the time before they get judged on their tenure position. At
Wisconsin you said it’s six years. I think it’s seven at Stanford.

148

Miner: [00:13:47] You could look that up, but I believe that six years is the national.
The national standard, as I understand it, which is set by the AAUP, the
American Association of University Professors, is that you have seven years
before you have to go, but the rule is you have to get the decision in six
years, because the norm is you got the seventh year to look for a job. So
you’re right. But the point is that there’s something going on if you’re
competing. Suppose you had a car accident and you were in a coma for a
year. You’d think that shouldn’t count on your clock, so to speak. This was
codifying and getting a clearer picture, which had a very big effect on
women, because women often did have more responsibility for sick children,
sick family. I think that [policy shift from informal accommodation to formal
extensions] was healthy, and, as I say, those sorts of things were going on. I
was sometimes involved in them.
But the main things happening were a lot of people were vaguely
sympathetic trying to work through what does this mean, and in most cases it
came out for the better. For me personally, those same things meant that by
the time after I had tenure, [more things were worked out] (with tenure you
can no longer be fired except for moral turpitude and felonies--just causes,
but they have to be pretty big causes).
By then, the school had come to having more women through more
junior faculty, and then I was more in the mentoring role for women faculty.
By the mid period, we vote for the members of the senior group in the
school who makes sort of final recommendations on promotion to tenure,

149

which is the biggest issue in terms of running the school, because that
determines who’s there forever.
I was voted on that every time, and as many years as you could be on it,
I was on it, because by then the whole school had not only accepted women
but they saw me as a role model, and the other woman too. We were not
only okay, we were in the central group. That was over a period of six or
seven years, that transformation. By then, it was whatever state that is, it was
definitely different from when I got there.
Devaney: Would you talk a little bit about what your areas of teaching and research
were?
Miner: [00:16:04] Sure. I’m in the management department, called Management and
Human Resources, and that includes theories about how individuals work in
organizations, how small groups work in organizations, how whole
organizations change and work and do things and then how industries or
regions might change. There’s all those levels, and in that world I picked the
organizational level or above. I’m called a macro researcher. I was convinced,
because of the Stanford experience, that intuitively, the account people
normally give about why something happens, for most of us, is [that] an
[individual] person did it. Back when I was here [doing affirmative action] in
the Stanford Hospital, they would hire a new director and the accounts of
why there’d be problems in a hospital would be the director had screwed up
or was good or whatever. But when I was affirmative action officer at
Stanford, I’m watching at Stanford, it was very clear to me that some things
had nothing to do with the individual, that we would just keep hiring new

150

hospital directors because it was a structural problem. There was an
impossible design in what they were supposed to do, from my point of view.
Devaney: So your research could differentiate between the person and the structure.
Miner: [00:17:26] My research was about the structure, and it’s part of a whole field
that looks at things that way, like a system. That was completely influenced
by my affirmative action days. I thought that’s a hidden engine, a hidden
lever why things happen, including gender patterns, right, and that we need
to understand those structural things if we’re going to, in general, change
them if you want to. That’s why I picked that level.
If I was in the gender minority world, if you asked me to give a talk
about that, I would talk about institutional discrimination, and that is things
like childcare leave or the tenure clock. Those are all unintended--well, who
knows what they meant to do. But they have the impact of one group. That’s
why I studied macro theory.
Then within that, there are many different theories. One set is about
rational planning. The next set of theories have to do with organizations as
political systems, like they’re not ever going to agree on one goal, so it’s all
about understanding political processes. Another set is about symbols. It’s all
about symbolic management, which is like if you were a person who said
actually affirmative action is adopted by companies, not because they mean
to do anything about this, but because symbolically they need to look like
they care, that would be a symbolic theory of why they did that. They just did
it to look like something, but it’s disconnected from what they’re really doing.

151

You need to think about that, and all of those things were revealed to me as I
was the affirmative action officer.
The last group of theories, which are the ones I committed to and I’m
still committed to, is what you call emergent, or theories where sensible
people are going along doing sensible things, but it all adds up to some
pattern that nobody really had in mind, because nobody designed that
pattern. That was the group I wanted to commit to, and that was totally
coming from watching how Stanford worked. It’s like it’s a big system, it’s
evolving, it’s like an evolutionary system, like a biological system. For a while
I used that metaphor to talk about it. But in the end, I think of it as learning,
so I study organizational learning, because the organizations try things, and
then, that didn’t come out, never comes out.
Devaney: You’ve been at Wisconsin now on the faculty almost thirty years, and you’ve
become a Most Distinguished Professor with an endowed chair and many
honors and distinctions. What do you think are your greatest contributions to
your field?
Miner: [00:20:07] I think it’s true in maybe more the social sciences. I’m not so sure
about the humanities. But it does seem in some of the physical sciences, so
to speak, you can say that you were the first person who discovered stem
cells, and that’s really it, and that’s unambiguous.
That’s harder to do in the social sciences. Not impossible; harder. In a
way, it’s sort of like being a composer, you have to wait till twenty years from
now to know what really mattered, because you don’t really know of the
many things you did which will have what we call a path-dependent effect,

152

that it happened and then it spawned many other things. What I’m known
for is organizational learning, and I have gotten an award for contributing to
that, especially in technology-related things.
Devaney: What do you see as your greatest contribution to your field?
Miner: [00:21:15] The ones that I’ve done so far that other people would say, I
think, is that when we study organizational learning, for the most part, most
of the models were assuming the main thing was the way organizations learn
is they look at what worked and then they do that again, that sort of thing.
What I said was sometimes it doesn’t work, and they learn from that or they
could and they don’t know. I have a whole body of work about learning from
organizational failure, learning from watching others. You remember about
benchmarking, where you’d go out and look at other places, what are they
doing, to learn from that? They would go out and do that. They would go for
best practices. My research is you don’t want to do that, because usually they
would just go sample some very successful place, and you can learn
something from that, but you may not learn the right things. Maybe it’s not
the same as you.
Devaney: Why wouldn’t studying best practices be useful?
Miner: [00:22:11] Because usually people go to the most successful firms to do that.
Devaney: Don’t they have the best practices?
Miner: [00:22:15] Not necessarily. That’s what we know from many things. Many
places that are successful are doing things that are really stupid and bad, so
your problem is you need to tell which ones are which. If you really want to
study other ones, you need to go look at both. It’s the same idea as an

153

experiment. You need to look at some schools that failed, then you see what
are the things that are successful, did the failure and didn’t. But if you say,
“I’m just going to look at Stanford and Northwestern,” which is what most
schools do, they’re doomed. They’re doomed because if Stanford was
assassinating the children, they would do that, too.
Devaney: They’re attributing causal effects where they aren’t appropriate.
Miner: [00:22:52] Where it’s not, that is right. Learning from failure is one, but the
other one that I do that I suspect will be probably what I’ll be seen as
contributing if I could finish what I’m doing now, is that most of our
theories--whatever they are, political, all that stuff--are assuming that it’s
intentional and in some sense you make up your mind in advance about what
you’re going to do. It’s a choice model that says you think about what you
want to do, then you do something.
Devaney: You’re talking about professional behavior?
Miner: [00:23:30] I’m talking about even the whole organization. In some sense, you
have a plan or some dream or incentive. In the entire economic model,
incentives drive everything. But it’s clearly not always the case, and
sometimes people are doing things to follow rules. The other special case
that I study is improvisation. My main thing is in organizational
improvisation, and on purpose I tried to publish a paper in a major journal,
because it’s just like the women’s thing. Initially, it was very marginal.
Organizational improvisation sounds kind of like something a hot tub in
California that only-Devaney: It’s sort of where you’re making it up as you go along?

154

Miner: [00:24:10] That’s right. But of course, when I was doing affirmative action,
we were improvising a lot, but it was not legitimate. As the president of
Coca-Cola, if the press asked you, “What are your strategic plans,” you
couldn’t say, “We don’t do that anymore. We’re going to improvise as we go
along.” You’d be fired, because it’s against an ideology that we have.
But we all do it. It’s sort of like my dissertation. It’s something
everybody knows about, but we don’t have any good theory, we don’t
articulate it. That one, I suspect, if I can finish a couple more papers, will be
the biggest impact I have. I hope to bring that in. It’s not that no one else
agrees. Lots of people agree. Very few in the most influential journals do,
[however] so that’s what I hope.
Devaney: What influence do you think that women have made to the field of business,
business training, business schools?
Miner: [00:25:23] I just now have been talking about my research, which is slightly
different from what I teach, which is a hidden aspect of business schools, I
think. Faculty not in business schools usually assume what we’re teaching is
how you would sell toothpaste to somebody. We have not done a good job
of clarifying what social science in business schools is about, that it’s hard.
It’s partly, I think, because there’s some distinction between what we teach
and what are the research issues, like the research issues I’ve just spoken
about. The research is more complex in business schools than what you can
teach, because we’re teaching foundational issues. Take the improvisation.
It’s a good example. In entrepreneurship, what has been taught in business
schools is you should plan ahead--mostly the worst thing you do is don’t plan

155

at all. “Oh, my mother would like to buy one of these, so there must be a big
market.” We say, “No, plan for the market.”
This is something where I actually don’t know if I’ll be able to
influence this, but I worked in that area, and then we found that our students
who had been trained in entrepreneurship, so to speak, writing business plans
and so on, would go out and start a company. [laughs] This isn’t funny. Then
they would fall apart because, of course, nothing in the plan ever worked that
way. Never worked that way. They had mistaken our emphasis on the
importance of planning to mean that if you plan, nothing will go wrong,
which is crazy. I think in that sense, we were almost--not irresponsible, but
correct education of entrepreneurship students would include content about
what they now call pivoting, how do you pivot, how do you improvise,
because that’s something we could add.
Devaney: Do you think that that’s a contribution that has been made primarily by
women to the field?
Miner: [00:27:24] No. You were talking about how teaching was different from
research. My point is we don’t teach anything about improvisation now. I do
a little bit. In my teaching activities, I’d still emphasize these unintended
outcomes, and I felt that was a contribution to both men and women.
Devaney: But if you look more broadly at the influence of women in business school
training, do you think that there has been--?
Miner: [00:27:59] It’s a very different question. Perfect point. I am a woman, though,
so whatever I did counts as part of the influence.

156

I think the answer is yes, and there are two types. I have a colleague
now, a young woman we just tenured, I’m very happy to say. She does
research on sex discrimination in the workplace, and she’s not the only
person. Men do research on that, too. It’s a field that has both men and
women. She’s an ethnic minority, which is even more unusual. That is really
unusual in a business school still. She brings to this perspective both the
minority and the women’s agenda, and she’s fearless and relentless in the care
in her research so you would never think that any result of hers was designed
out of her own ideology. She’s very careful. But she’s there, slowly chipping
away at understanding what’s going on in the workplace. Things like this
phenomenon we know about in the group that many women report, but it’s
anecdotal. They say, “I’m in this group, and there’s men. Then I say, ‘How
about if we painted the room red? That’d be an idea.’ Then the meeting goes
on and then Ralph says, ‘How about if we painted the room red?’ And the
chair says, ‘What a great idea, Ralph.’” [laughs]
Devaney: Does that still happen?
Miner: [00:29:33] Yes. But she studies when it happens and why it happens and how
much it happens and what are the conditions. It’s wonderful to see, because
in a way, we’re finally getting hard evidence about what are these micro
processes that influence things. It’s not only in business schools. I’m saying
that doesn’t take women to do that. One of my colleagues is a man, and he
studies unconscious bias, and they have hard evidence about stereotypes.
Devaney: Are you saying that women are only bringing issues to bear on women’s
issues?

157

Miner: [00:30:10] No, I’m not saying that. That’s one thing. No, that’s my first point.
My first point was one type of research is like that. The points is that women
increase the chances of that. Many women did more work on sexual
harassment, but men do that work too. Separate from that is the biggest
issue, which is the most fundamental issue in a hundred-year context, which
is do women in any other way, do they change the nature of the general
knowledge. You could still see that specifically.
[00:30:37] And do they? That experiment is not clear. I think so,
because women are socialized in certain ways and more inclined probably to
do certain sorts of ethical things. We have some women doing work in
marketing on the importance of touch. I do think that that will happen. But I
don’t think we could assert that as a fact yet.
Devaney: Do you think if there were more women than men teaching history, the
history books would all be filled about military accomplishments with
nothing about society? I’m talking about women in academia in general. The
impact of women.
Miner: [00:31:21] I felt that. Let’s go back. What is a field? A field can be the
phenomenon, like war versus child-raising, or it can be history, which is
where we’re going to take the past and we’re going to use certain methods
versus economics is we’re going to talk about theories of economic activity.
To the degree the fields are by phenomenon, then having women influence it
is because of that. Because everybody studies what they care about. That’s
basically it.

158

[00:32:02] That argument is a crucial argument about the importance of
diversity in general. It’s also why you want a black American or Spanish
surname or Native American.
I do believe that’s true. On the other hand, I don’t think it’s enough. I
mean, I think the bigger question is whether the diversity has value in
addition to that. There are two values. One is you extend the phenomena
that are being studied. The other is, but what about the whole approach
we’re taking? What about the deep assumptions that we’re making about
society? That one is a bigger one, and I think it will make an effect to have
diverse people, but that we have some evidence to go on that.
Devaney: Let’s spend a little bit of time on some numbers here. In January of 1971,
according to your data, women represented 5 percent of Stanford’s faculty.
Today, forty-three years later, women at Stanford in those same faculty ranks
represent 25 percent of all the faculty. Among the faculty in 1971, only 2
percent of full professors were women. Today, 20 percent of the full
professors are women. In 1971, women represented 8 percent of Stanford’s
assistant professors, and today women constitute 35 percent of all assistant
professors. One thing that struck me when we compared these data was the
much higher proportion of women faculty at Stanford now in the assistant
professor level than forty years ago. Do you think this trend is happening at
other universities as well?
Miner: [00:33:41] Yes, I think this huge movement that we described has been
slowly diffusing across the whole society and continues to.

159

Devaney: Does this suggest that the pipeline of available women may be getting wider
and that we should expect to see continuing increases in women faculty?
Miner: Yes. If you want to get concrete, if you look back at the Stanford data in the
first report, as I remember, the number of women faculty in the law school
and the medical school, let’s say, was zero. Zero.
[00:34:20] Both of those fields have even tipped, I would say. Maybe
not tipped totally. They have in terms of their students but not faculty. But
they’re serious, and it’s like it’s not half, but it’s a nontrivial presence.
Devaney: Yes. In fact, in 1971 the only schools at Stanford that had women faculty
were Education, Medicine, and Humanities and Sciences. That means that
Earth Sciences, Law, Business, and Engineering had no women faculty at all.
Now there are women faculty in all schools at Stanford, as well as at SLAC.
So what this says is not only do we have more people within a field, but that
it looks like we’ve got a lot more women in different fields.
Miner: [00:35:05] Well, not a lot. One needs to distinguish between those, because
the success in the sort of engineering/physics, computer science is
completely unlike that in law schools and medical schools. Something tipped
in the other professional schools that is not yet at the same order of
magnitude in the STEM fields, as we call them--science, technology,
mathematics, and engineering.
Devaney: Math and engineering. But that is, of course, because so few women went
into those fields.
Miner: [00:35:34] In 1971, if you were going to make a bet, you had no reason to
distinguish between law and medicine and engineering. They all looked

160

equally impossible, right? But, in fact, in certain areas change happened. In
others, it was much harder, and that remains today. That’s still an issue.
[00:36:02] To me, that’s why it’s the best way to look at it as learning.
Whatever it was we thought it was, we weren’t quite right because the things
that were designed to make a change in these other fields were also
recruiting, being nice to women, flyers, childcare, all that stuff was done
everywhere, so why isn’t the outcome the same in engineering and physics as
it is in the law school? It can’t be that our early thoughts about what were the
blockages were quite right, because it worked in these other places, but it
didn’t yet work in the same way. That’s how I see that, and that’s why it does
make me sad sometimes when people address the STEM field one as though
nobody ever even tried anything, because I think that’s the wrong way to
think. I think the way to think about it is, “Boy, this is really interesting,”
because whatever these processes are, they’re ones we didn’t understand or
figure out or understand yet enough to make it happen. Now, there’s always
the theory that women intrinsically don’t want to do this.
Or they’re too stupid, and those are both plausible theories. [laughs] I
shouldn’t tell this story, but I will. Many of the people in engineering,
because I work with them a lot, they have a lot of trouble with their hidden
unconscious thought that people in the business school are people who
weren’t bright enough to go into engineering, and they really have that in the
back of their minds. So they have to readjust that, well, no, it’s not really just
that, and similarly around gender.

161

Devaney: Didn’t the former president of Harvard [Larry Summers] lose his job because
of what he said? Say more about what he said.
Miner: [00:37:49] He went to a conference on these very questions where everybody
actually was expert, and, I mean, it’s not like they were just sitting around the
dining room table. These were people who studied these questions. I have to
say a little bit about this because it’s really a very telling incident. What he did
was he stood up and made off-the-cuff remarks, drawing on a couple of
studies that his friends had done, and said, “Well, clearly, we have to accept
the fact or that maybe the best way to look at this is that women cognitively
are--we’re missing the really brilliant people. We’re missing the top 2 percent.
They’re not ever going to do that. They don’t have the mathematical [ability]
genetically. Genetically, they’re never going to be able to do that, so that we
should be planning our remedies around that.” Now, he could have said that
as a person, but he was standing there as the president of Harvard, which had
just recently incorporated Radcliffe College and promised to care about all
those women.
[00:38:51] This is recently, but I have to say something, because it’s
very important to understand. When he did that, the way he was acting, the
way he said that in that provocative way and in sort of a bad-boy way was
exactly how [most] economists interact. That’s how they do things. All he did
was follow a routine from what helped him when he was a young, smart
economist in his local environment, kind of a smart ass--pardon me--but, you
know, technically clever and on purpose being provocative. He hadn’t

162

realized he was not a young guy showing himself. He had this moral
responsibility to his constituency, and then he was gone in part because of it.
Devaney: The outrage that happened among the faculty at Harvard and the resulting
step down after that would probably not have happened forty years ago.
That’s just the way it was, right?
Miner: [00:39:48] You mean would that have happened? No, that would never have
happened. No, that would have been considered as a reasonable argument. It
is still an issue being contested….
Devaney: In 1971, Stanford had no women who were even deans. In the past ten years,
we’ve had deans of all the schools at Stanford except medicine, as well as
dean of research. In fall 2014-15, four of Stanford’s seven schools will have
women as deans, plus a woman dean of research. By comparison, do you
have a sense about the progression of women in academic leadership roles at
other universities?
Miner: [00:40:55] I think that’s fairly representative of what’s going on in general,
certainly where I am--some more of us, more women deans. I don’t know if
they’re in the majority. Our last two chancellors at Wisconsin have been
women, and so I think there’s still a hope by many people, including senior
men. I’ve been on the search committee for our chancellors, and there is a
community of what I call the thought leaders. These are philanthropists,
people who are on a lot of boards of higher education, and very
sophisticated, and they talk to each other. Like our candidate for Wisconsin,
we got from Cornell, and I think one reason she was wanted was one of our
key people who knew the board member there, said, “You should get this

163

woman, and as a woman, it would be good to get a woman for the symbolic
purposes at this time.” In fact, she was in humanities, which was also a good
symbolic move, because everybody’s worried we’re about to destroy the
humanities.
Everybody’s worried about the fate of humanities in the major research
universities, correctly, so that was another thing saying that would help
symbolically to do. I’m just saying I think that that national group of people
who influenced, who were on boards, the trustees, many of them come out
of the business world or maybe the foundation world, they still believe this is
an unfinished revolution that should happen, and so they support them.
Devaney: An interesting point you made recently, Anne, was that when you’re talking
about tenure and appointment decisions in your committees at Wisconsin,
you’re now hearing men say, “No, that’s discriminatory,” or something like
that, whereas it used to be just the women who were carrying that ball. Say
more about that.
Miner: [00:42:41] I have to believe this is true at Stanford as well, maybe not on
every search committee, but turning to the personal, I now go to meetings-say it’s a search committee--there was one recently for the vice president for
research. We have a $1 billion-a-year annual research budget. It’s a massive
part of [the University of Wisconsin]. It’s one of the biggest in the country.
So this is a big job. During the meetings in the old days, it would have gone
as follows. I would have been expected to bring up women and minority
candidates. That would have been my job to find them.

164

The other thing was my job to say, “That criterion right there--’we
should have somebody who used to be a member of the Boy Scouts’--that’s
not such a good idea, maybe we should get past [that and] not use a criterion
that palpably will exclude all the women.” What I love is I go on these
committees, and at least the last one I was on, the chair was very clearheaded. He was the one saying, “This is really important. We have to search
for women and minorities.” He was the one telling the search committee we
need to do that. Our current chancellor just came from Washington. She’s
been a faculty member and run internal things, so she’s right. But she had
wider experiences. She wasn’t like your standard candidate. That came partly
from thinking we need to think broadly about who can do this. The last one
is the chairmen will be the ones who say that would be a sexist way to look at
it. To me, it’s this wonderful thing to sit there and watch this move from the
advocate people doing it to the [other leadership by whoever is in charge,
including white males who are very sophisticated on issues of bias and
positive value of diversity].
There’s one other thing at Wisconsin I don’t know if you’re doing here,
which is, I think, the next frontier, as long as we’re on this. When we were
doing this work before--I’d cite the report in 1971--this question of
unconscious bias. Is it there? There was a little evidence then.
[00:45:20] They would send you CVs, résumés, of candidates for a job,
and they’d be exactly the same in terms of how many publications they had
and all they had done, and one was Sally Jones and one was Sam Jones. The
only thing different was the gender of the person.

165

Devaney: That really is just gender bias. Those are research projects that have been
done in a lot of different contexts.
Miner: [00:45:49] Yes, but now, they actually have research about that it’s not just
men doing that. It’s like this terrible thing that, in a sense, we all have
tremendous bias by both race and sex, but they have that evidence now that’s
much more concrete. This is a field of psychology and it’s a big topic.
Now when you are on a search committee at the University of
Wisconsin, the people who are the experts have come in to the search
committee and say, “This is not advocacy. This is not affirmative action. This
is what we have to deal with as members of the community who believe in
diversity. So here is the evidence.” They cite the [current studies on
unconscious bias].
Everybody in the room is thinking, “All human beings have bias,” and
then they discuss this question of what do we do to overcome that bias in an
affirmative way, which has nothing to do with justice or anything.
[00:46:45] It doesn’t blame anybody, and it’s grounded in what is the
central value in a research university, which is research-based knowledge,
evidence-based knowledge. It has a value and integrity, a power nothing else
could have. That’s another thing that makes me very happy, and I think we’ll
see that more.
Devaney: That’s very interesting. But on the other hand, according to an article written
by Scott Jaschik in a 2010 issue of Inside Higher Education, women in 2009
actually earned more PhDs in all fields combined than did men in the United
States, and if we just look at the field of education, women earned 67 percent

166

of the PhDs. They earned 60 percent of the PhDs in social sciences, and 53
percent in the humanities. By comparison, at Stanford, women currently
constitute 42 percent of faculty in education, 27 percent in the social
sciences, and 37 percent in the humanities. Do you think the proportion of
women earning doctorates in the U.S. will ever be matched by the proportion
of women faculty in American universities?
Miner: [00:47:57] Wonderful question and one that presents a puzzle to the symbolic
questions in this area. I used to have a joke that we could solve all this if we
could--this is not going to sound too playful, but it was playful--that if this
was a revolution, a political revolution, you would just kill all the people on
the faculty now, which would leave enough jobs to be able to reach parity,
and you could just hire enough women. That would solve it.
[00:48:42] Before we get to this one here, the first question about what
will drive that number, not of the hiring rate--suppose you’re hiring exactly
the number and the percentage of women who are PhDs. If 90 percent of
the people there are not diverse, then it might take-Devaney: You mean if the current base is not representative of the population.
Miner: [00:49:04] Whatever it is. If the current base is all dogs, then you say, “No,
we need cats and rabbits, too,” if you only had that little 5 percent gap to
ever get there, and if just in your own head you think about, at the most you
could ever do it might take you 50 or 100 years. Then the other thing, which
I didn’t realize then and everyone knew then, and that’s a tough issue in
explaining to people, sensible observers about why--

167

Devaney: What you’re saying is that you’ve already got a base of x number faculty and
that you hire very few faculty in any department in any given year. Much
smaller than many people realize. You might not have any openings at all for
faculty in a department for three years or whatever.
Miner: [00:49:45] That’s right. Not that you can’t do anything, but it’s relatively
small. Even if you were perfect--and certainly if you had nothing
compensatory in your rate--it would take you a long time. You might need to
hire slightly higher than the number of PhDs to get anywhere. The second
issue about that question about what will determine the base rate, the total
percentage, is that--continuing our example of the dogs and the rabbits--if
you hire rabbits in at a good rate, but you lose them, too, then you really
don’t get anywhere.
[00:50:27] In this case, first, you lose some anyway. Normal attrition.
Then in the question of rarer fields--and this is a big issue for Stanford--there
aren’t too many women stars in some fields yet. There is a competition for
them. They get stolen, I mean, everybody gets stolen. But if you’ve just spent
five years trying to get a senior woman to come, which is sometimes what it
takes, then someone else comes, then she’s gone, is that good for society?
Probably, yes, because it’s good to keep them sprinkled around the country.
But is it good for Stanford? Probably not. These numbers are a function of
that, which is why, in the end, one comes to, among other things, over and
over this question of the pipeline, the retention thing. That wouldn’t be such
a problem if you could be a good pipeline. The answers, where it will end up,
I don’t know, but I do think it’s a hundred-year problem.

168

I have to say one other thing. That point that I just made about the
importance of the baseline doesn’t mean that there aren’t still issues of not
doing enough to begin with, that you’re not getting enough hiring at all, even
given the availability. There’s one phenomenon I did see a lot. When I first
went up to HEW and looked at some data they had in 1972, roughly, and
they had many, many schools, and they had zero women faculty in these
departments. Then you looked about two years later, and they had one, and
then they stopped. That’s a symbolic management question, the people felt it
looked bad to have no women, so they hired one woman. To some degree, if
I look at my own situation at Wisconsin, after I was hired, in my little twelveunit group, there was one other woman hired. It was not that no women
were hired, but there’s sort of a relief that occurs.
[00:52:37] We have a woman, because it doesn’t look so bad. Then the
question is how do you mobilize and inspire and get things going? Just to
finish that tale of my own twelve-unit department, we now have, plus me,
two tenured women, and they just hired two assistant professors….
Devaney: What are your thoughts about the progress that has been made in the hiring
of women faculty in academia over the last forty-three years?
Miner: [00:53:44] Two points on that, and they’re related. One is the focus on hiring
or on how many are there is important, but it was never the goal, in a sense.
That wasn’t the ultimate goal.
Why are we doing all this? It’s not a game, a political system where you
say women want to get their share of something. I don’t think that was the
point. Let me just say this. The automatic model we were all using then was

169

that there were really three things. One was the presence of women in these
research roles. Backing up, research universities are about creating knowledge
for society, and I know you know that. We are the only institution in the
world where your full-time major role is to create knowledge for knowledge’s
sake. Companies create knowledge all the time, but they stop it if it doesn’t
have commercial value right away. They’re obliged to do that. If you go
around the world, you’ll find people doing anything -- governments would
do anything to get the higher educational system in the United States because
of that research power, that underlying thing. That’s so crucial because
everything that a university does, if we lose that--it’s much more fragile than
people understand, in my opinion.
It’s fragile because it’s so easy to say--and this is what Lyman would
think I was doing--”I know, but we’re really rich and we’re powerful, so we
should fix x,” whatever x was. We should fix the role of women, we should
fix minorities, we should fix any social problem. We do want to do that.
Applied knowledge is important. But I’m more sensitive to it in the business
school because there are a lot of people there who in business will say, “Well,
you shouldn’t--.” I actually had someone suggest to me that--two people.
One said, “You should make every professor in the entire University of
Wisconsin--.” We have 46,000 students. “Every professor should have to
explain to the dean every semester what the professor’s done about product
development, that they should be contributing to the development of new
products in the United States for sale in companies.” That person saw
nothing wrong with that.

170

Devaney: Wait. You have to talk about what you’re doing toward product
development?
Miner: [00:56:42] Yes, [this person was suggesting that all professors should link
whatever they taught to product development] because this is, in our case,
state money. What the heck are you doing if you’re not doing that? You
should be sustaining economic development. We need more products. You
laugh. [laughs] I want to note for the record, you’re making a face.
Devaney: No. I just think the role of the university is to extend knowledge not to
create products, but different argument.
Miner: [00:57:01] Yes, but that’s because you are in that culture. My point is, you
may ask why is it fragile? It’s fragile because what I just said to you is not
laughable. I’ve met trustees who really are puzzled. Why isn’t that what we
should do? That’s why I think it’s fragile. It’s a never-ending water on stone,
and I keep reminding that and to verify that.
Devaney: Plus, don’t you think that the proportion of research done at major research
universities is increasingly funded by corporate sponsors, rather than the
federal government? This raises, a question of having to create product, so
that may lead to more applied research than what we would like to be doing.
Miner: [00:57:38] Yes. And that’s why it’s fragile in the end because universities are
mindfully [doing more applied research] and I’m involved in training doctoral
students how to do product development, so I always am spending a lot of
time on this.
I go back to that just because that means the vision about women and
minorities that, to me, in the end is the crucial one, is what these institutions

171

are, these research universities. Then the issue is, is the way things are
working such that the talent, the vision, the contributions of women and
minorities in there, in that mix, do we, (a) as a society have the benefit of
what women and minorities have to offer in terms of knowledge creation,
and, (b) are the people who have the calling to do that from those groups
allowed to get in, into that incredible mission?
Devaney: How many does it take to have enough?
Miner: [00:58:39] Whatever it is now is probably not enough in most places, so we
can’t answer that question.
That’s the premise I start with, and I think in the beginning, which I
saw then, too, the assumption was in the early ’70s that whatever the number
is, it’s not right the way it is now. Then there was a justice question, that
women had been unfairly excluded. This question of realizing our potential is
latent. But the idea was implicitly that having women there wasn’t enough,
because the second thing was you have to do something about the roles. Are
there women in senior roles? Are they influencing the core ideas, as you said?
Do you influence the nature of science?
The third one, what is the climate in everyday life? Are you as a
member of this department actually there or not? As I say in my own little
department, I think now, forty years later, they will have a culture that will be
genuinely diverse, and they will get the full merit of the different people
there.
The logic was then we can’t solve all the seniority problems, we can’t
solve all the climate problems, but if you get enough women and minorities

172

in these senior roles, that will set in motion--it’ll be a beachhead, and that
beachhead is irreversible, that once you’re there on the sand in Normandy,
you know, you will take France and we will win World War II, and that was
kind of the premise that we didn’t even know.
Devaney: Do you think the progress women have made so far is irreversible?
Miner: [01:00:12] I personally do, and I was conscious of that irreversibility problem
long ago. It hadn’t dawned on me initially. I thought, it seems like, great, this
is happening,
Devaney: In the 1960s, ’70s, the Women’s Movement was the first time it ever
happened.
Miner: [01:00:38] Yes, absolutely. And it lasted. Things I saw as a child are becoming
real. It’s like the toy Easter Bunny that’s now becoming real. About 1969, I
was out leafletting in Palo Alto for a Women’s Liberation march of some
sort. I went up to a house in one of these Palo Alto houses, big things with
ivy and strange things growing out of the windows, and a little old lady
comes to the door, opens the screen door, a tiny woman with white hair, and
I give her the leaflet. She looks at the leaflet and read it. She says, “Oh, this is
about women. This is about the role of women in society.” I said, “Yes, it’s
very exciting. We’re talking about changing that.” And she said, “Oh, dear.”
She didn’t pat me on the head, but it was approximately that.
Devaney: Patronizing.
Miner: [01:01:23] No, it was more like sympathetic. It was more like someone who’s
tired and says, “Good luck on the journey,” to the next person. She says,
“Well, that is wonderful, dear. I can’t come to your march, but I do hope this

173

time it works,” because she had been involved in the women’s--women
didn’t vote in this country until the ‘20s. I can’t remember, but it was in that
century. She’d been involved in at least two previous turns of the wheel of
questioning and changes of women’s roles. That’s what she saw. She saw this
is another trial, another experiment as a society.
Devaney: And she said, “This time I hope it works”? Did she think that the Women’s
Suffrage Movement did not work? Women got the vote.
Miner: [01:02:07] They did, but what she assumed, as I did, that it wasn’t about a
political gain, it wasn’t about any particular thing; it was about the underlying
society and whether sex roles were such that it limited both men and women
in some fundamental ways to express everything they have in them.
Devaney: So the Suffrage Movement was a step. Getting more women in academia is
another step, right?
Miner: [01:02:38] Yes, but it doesn’t [fully] answer yet, and [does] it definitely
prove?--would it be better now to be a Stanford faculty person in terms of
the day-to-day interaction and realizing your potential? Of course, as a
woman or minority, anybody, [it would be better than before 1970’s] because
many things have worked. But is it what we would dream of in terms of a
society in which every person’s potential was used and expressed and each
person felt the ability to do that? In that sense, she was saying we’re not there
yet. But the question you asked me was is this irreversible, and that, I think,
at this point is completely a matter of personal belief. That’s a choice we’d
have to make. As you know, there are many parts of the world where it’s very

174

reversible, I think, in other aspects of social--things like abortion in this
country, you can see them go back and forth historically.
Devaney: In fact, some people think this country’s gone backward with respect to
things like reproductive rights.
Miner: [01:03:43] Right. Then the question is whether you see that as an oscillating
pattern, that it goes back, it goes forth, it goes back, it goes forth.
Devaney: But the general trend goes up.
Miner: [01:03:51] That’s right. Or whether you think it’s actually going back. The
difficult thing for most people, including me, is that even if you think it’s a
trend going up with bumps around it, with waves and troughs, if you don’t
stand up, again, and say, “Stop”--so in my own life, I’ll tell you a story. Here I
am, this is two years ago, in a prestigious group of colleagues in my field,
macro organization theory. Macro organization research is national. I have a
job offer from Northwestern and from Wharton, which are the top business
schools in the country, so to a degree you should be safe. I think I was safe.
So this is a group, they all care about women, they respect women, they have
women friends, but they formed a group off the record where they could
informally get together and talk about research, and they did it as where
whoever was in it now would identify future potential members, which is a
well-known dangerous kind of mechanism. They did that, and they invited
people, the whole group, maybe fifty or forty people. I would go and I would
be the only or one of two women, just like forty years ago.
And they wanted to fix it. I didn’t do very well in that case. I sort of
felt, “I’ve been doing this too long. I don’t really want to try to fix this, but I

175

will be sympathetic.” Another friend of mine did and recruited women and
then some women came. The next year, we had maybe ten women out of
sixty, which was great.
This is my point about the endless saga. I sat down next to my friend
who does research in organizational learning at one of the beginning
seminars in the morning at a table. These are square tables in a U-shape, and
I sat next to Christine because I wanted to talk to her in research. My friend
Willie rushes over to me and--this is no irony, no joke here--he says, “Anne,
you can’t sit there. Don’t do that. Don’t sit Next to Christine.” I said, “Why
don’t you want--?”
He says, “We’re trying to fix the women problem, so don’t you want to
be out sitting among the men, so there are spaces between the women, so
you can show the men that you’re capable?” I have to confess, I didn’t do it
right, because at that point I should have said, “This is not irreversible, so we
constantly have to do water--.” But at the time, I said, “I’m sorry, that is not
my problem. I want to talk to Christine, because that’s what’s in the interest
of women faculty today here, is for us to progress in our research.” I
probably should have moved, but that was another case where we had to
work on educating the men there about these nuances of a respectful diverse
context, because they just had never thought of that. This was two years ago,
among people who were uniformly pro women, including the top women in
the field.
[01:06:58] I’m just saying if you believe in the cyclical thing, the tough
part, I think, is that everyone, including the men, still have to learn about

176

what does it mean to have everyone able to express what they have to say or
to contribute, and how do we do that. Just because it’s actually better, doesn’t
mean we can totally give up the alertness and the learning from the past.
Does that make sense?
Devaney: Yes, absolutely.
If you had it to do over, would you choose an academic career?
Miner: [01:07:31] I do feel like my destiny and my authentic self is an academic.
Took me a long time. I was an assistant professor for four years before I was
sure this is what I should be doing. It took me a long time to learn that I
could do it and that I want to do this. But the question you asked is could I
have decided that when I was thirty. I don’t know.
Devaney: I just wonder if--you started out in medical school, then you had a senior
staff position, you could have gone to Washington from here. Then you went
to the business school. Then you decided, after all, that you wanted to be a
faculty member. Would you do that all over again?
Miner: [01:08:19] Yes.
Devaney: It’s a long journey to make that decision.
Miner: [01:08:21] Yes. I feel like, as I said before, it’s like your ice sculpture, and you
start with this big block of ice. Some people have a piece of paper that has a
picture of what’s supposed to be. It’s going to be an elephant, right? And
they cut things out. That’s not the way everybody does things, and mine is
the second path, where it had to be revealed to me through action in my own
life. Through that process, I think I always was an academic completely, and

177

this is my authentic being, but it took all those experiences kind of carving
different things away and leaving who I was--am.
Devaney: I see a lot of young women at Stanford now who say things like, “I knew
ever since I was seven I wanted to be an astronaut,” or scientist or whatever.
It seems like in my generation, the choices for little girls were to marry well,
be a good mother and, go into education because you could always get a job
as a teacher in case your husband died.
To what extent do you think the fact that we were not encouraged as
youngsters to pursue our dreams kind of made it a more confusing and a
slower journey for us to figure out what we wanted to do and be?
Miner: [01:09:36] I think that’s unquestionably the case, and one of the wonderful
things is that this is why role models matter--we used to do things like have
to have pictures of women and minorities in these publications. People
would say, “But we did that. It’s so ’70s.” But when the first quotation--you
remember the first interview about women coming into the classroom and
you don’t see a woman the whole time they’re there. Or a member of their
ethnic group. I think your comment about what was imaginable for women
in those days is completely correct, and that means every time there’s a
woman dean or a woman athlete or a woman whatever, political figure, it has
this ripple effect, and that’s why it matters. Some people will say, “Who cares
about those women deans? That’s just symbolic.” Over at Stanford you’ve
got the majority of women deans. So you say, “Big deal. It’s windowdressing,” la-di-da. Maybe it’s still nothing, but of course it does matter,
right?

178

Devaney: In fact, we have a new dean coming into the School of Engineering who’s a
woman who’s not even an engineer. She’s a physicist. Part of the rationale
for that is we just have to get more women role models in these fields.
Miner: [01:11:01] Exactly. I don’t think that’s a joke. I think it’s completely true, and
it has a slow effect. We’ve got to wait for those little girls to grow up, partly. I
completely agree that’s true, and I do think we did not have that in the same
way.
[01:11:14] In that sense, I’m glad my mother worked, because, I don’t
know, I suspect that did affect me, outside the home.
Devaney: But did your parents ever say, “Anne, why don’t you think about being a
college professor when you grow up?”
Miner: [01:11:23] They didn’t, although to be intellectually clean about it, they never
said that to my brothers either. It wasn’t like they didn’t say that to me
because I was a girl. They just didn’t say it to anybody.
Devaney: Is there anything you’d have done differently in your professional life if you
had it to do over? I mean, was the trajectory you took the right one?
Miner: [01:11:44] Leaving aside the question of what we did or didn’t get done on
the affirmative action front, this is a different question in terms of my
personal career. This is going to sound strange, but probably the Stanford
affirmative action officer experience prepared me in many ways for life as a
faculty member. Even so, I underestimated the competitive nature of
academia. I don’t think business school. I think even then I would have
toughened myself up more.

179

Devaney: Do you think it’s more competitive than it was one or two or three decades
ago? There are a lot more faculty, and proportionately less money out there.
Miner: [01:12:45] I think in my field it probably is. I think you have to do way more.
But it’s also collegial. The entire thing only works because we cooperate with
each other, and my research only matters because it’s linked to other people’s
research. But it’s also brutally competitive. You’re constantly thinking about
those eight thousand citations. I have to think about how to get my work
cited. I don’t do that. Some people do that. But how to get published. When
I train doctoral students, they often have a very, very cynical view. They think
it’s all who you know. That’s just nonsense. It’s not who you know. Really,
ultimately, it’s how good it is. But to get it as good as it can be, you have to
get the best people to read it and give you feedback, so in that sense it is
political. You have to use social processes. I think I underestimated that, and
I would probably have toughened myself up or just kind of been accepting of
that a little more. Otherwise, I don’t know if I would change much.
Devaney: Do you think, when you look back at your career in the ’70s in affirmative
action at Stanford, do you think the issues you tackled then were the right
issues?
Miner: [01:13:52] To the degree that we had in mind these three things I said of the
numbers and the roles of who’s senior or not, and then this climate of what I
call micro process about encouraging women and minorities-Devaney: Could you go back a little bit of that? What are some of the big issues that
you look at from that period that kind of were hallmarks of your career at
Stanford? Did you have any confrontational issues, for example?

180

Miner: [01:14:29] I don’t think this was the hallmark of my career, in the sense I
tended to be nonconfrontational. But when we did the management
development program, some of the stuff we put in there were these
techniques that don’t require you to confront. For example, we were doing
something about staff affirmative action and we had these affirmative action
coordinators--it may have been the goals and timetables. No, I think it was
the first-in, last-out question. We were worried about that.
[01:15:11] A well-known problem had to do with minority hiring. So
you hire people in--this is in general in the world. An employer hires some
group in that’s a new group that hasn’t been there before in times of wealth,
and then there’s a budget cutback of some kind, so then what happens in
many systems the people who were just hired are gone. It’s last in, first out.
That was a big concern that when there were budget things, they would do
that. I could have issued a memo to every department head at Stanford and
had my coordinators go around and worry about that, but that was not a very
efficient method and it would not have worked, because I didn’t have the
direct power. I didn’t have a staff of five hundred people to do that.
We agreed, and the provost did a good job on this when we put it--and
I remember drafting letters in the annual budget request that everybody has
to do, they have to answer certain questions about their planning. The last
question was, “Will the cuts that you plan to make--,” because they had to
put in a plan if you were cut by 15 percent or 5 percent or 0 percent, what
would you do. The last question said, “If you did those things, what would
be the impact on minority representation?” That was a case of not using

181

confrontation but what I called Aikido theory or a sheepdog theory. You
take where is the power and momentum that’s already there, which was in
the budget process, and you attach your thing to that. I always thought that
was a good one. It didn’t work everywhere.
The provost did a very good job of that. Now, did it do everything? I
don’t think so, but I definitely saw places where that changed them, because
it wasn’t separate from their main life and didn’t even matter.
Devaney: That was an era we had a lot of budget cuts.
Miner: [01:17:00] Huge. And if you think through a lot, they didn’t know for sure
whether the provost would or would not do anything.
[01:17:09] If I’m a department chairman. They didn’t know, but it
didn’t matter if they knew because it was clear that they were at risk, that if
he was trying not to give them money, that all he would have to do is say,
“Oh, I’m so sorry. It looks like you’re going to lose all minorities. Can’t do
it.” They just didn’t want to get in that, so it caused them--as I say, the
policemen within, it created that. That was an example of a
nonconfrontational intervention that was, I think, characteristic of the things
I was looking for a lot of the time.
Devaney: In fact, I think, Anne, that you were viewed as remarkably successful in your
career, and you became a national spokesperson on affirmative action
because you were balanced and thoughtful and you pushed things that would
work and you let go of stuff that wasn’t going to work, and you listened to
different views and you did not come across as having a single point of view.
I think that men who were threatened by these issues could relax a little and

182

think they were dealing with a rational person, and I think that made a huge
difference in those days.
Miner: [01:18:12] I hope so. I’ve had people say that to me. But on the
confrontation side, to continue that issue, and I appreciate that, because that
was what I aspired to do, that there were two dark sides, or not so obvious
sides of it. One was the job requires you sometimes to draw the line. That’s
the point. There were times when a dean would do something, and I had
data, direct knowledge from somebody else who was in the room, that what
they proposed to do was completely [wrong]--they were going to hire
somebody they knew. For faculty positions it would have been a different
situation, but these would be maybe an associate dean or a senior staff
person. They were proposing to hire someone, and I knew from other
sources that they were going to hire someone who was a personal friend as I
say, [and not hire] a minority male who was qualified and a very reasonable
candidate. The dean, for personal social reasons, intended to hire not that
person (the minority candidate) but someone else (the personal friend), and I
knew that for a fact. In some cases I had a sort of ethical obligation. I had to
do something about that. In some cases I didn’t. When I had that kind of
information, I would have to call up the dean and say, “You know, let’s go
over this hiring you’re doing,” and that would surprise them. A couple times,
if what they were doing was clearly wrong enough, I’d say, “If you’re going to
go forward with this, we’re going to have to talk to President Lyman. I can’t
sign off on this.”

183

Devaney: Because you thought they were making preferential hiring decisions based on
subjective factors that had nothing to do with the qualification of the
applicants?
Miner: [01:20:01] Correct. Which happened also to have an adverse impact on race,
by race and sex.
Now, someone suggested to me that I should look for cases like that
because of the ripple effect, and a little bit I did that. But the key is it had to
be one that was impeccably clear, because it wasn’t going to work if I failed.
Then there was one in the med school that I think worked pretty well.
It was just a hiring thing. [If you] intervene, and you could tell six months
later that everybody knew that the Affirmative Action Office had blocked
that hire, and they were surprised, and that then they didn’t want to go
through that. So they did better.
Now, this we haven’t talked about, but a self-doubt I had later was
sometimes things people were doing wrong were way back in the early issues;
they would say something out loud like, “I don’t want to hire this woman
because she might have a baby.” Of course they would do that initially. The
person who hired me, the first person, Bob Freelen, said, “I like to hire
women because you can pay them less,” because that wasn’t a problem then.
That was normal, and he saw that as a good thing because it helped the
university, it helped the woman getting hired. Sometimes the reasons they
were getting hired--and probably the Personnel Office stopped a lot of these
too. They would be, “No, don’t say that. You can’t use that.”

I sometimes thought part of it what we did was we taught people how
to discriminate better. I mean, we taught them, “If you want to do this you
have to be much more careful.” For a long time that bothered me, and I
thought, “I would rather they would go on doing it overtly, because then we
can live in reality here.” I finally concluded that, in essence, hypocrisy’s not
all bad, because obviously we’d rather they didn’t do that, but their
subordinates--I can’t explain. They then couldn’t model that as legitimate. It
became illegitimate to do those things, and it’s good that it was illegitimate.
Then later, the next people sometimes weren’t actually doing that. I decided
in the end, it wasn’t all bad.
Devaney: Do you have any advice for young women starting out today in academic
careers?
Miner: [01:22:27] I would rather finish this other thing you said were the things that
didn’t get done.
Devaney: Oh, yes. When you were affirmative action officer.
Miner: [01:22:37] Yes. This is not relating to me personally, but in terms of the
institution, what did we get done and what did we not get done. Personally, I
feel that, to go back to the beachhead image, and so in some cases we’d put a
little flag saying, “This is not quite right here, and someone should do
something about it.” So continuing with our faculty issues or not staff,
anyway, academic staff in particular, in the report we talked about it says
there should be review of the research associates and the lecturers in terms of
the opportunity structure for women. I may be wrong, but my impression
was that I was naïve. There wasn’t enough of a beachhead in some areas, that

185

I thought just sort of flagging it, and there were other parts of the university
that thought there were problems, so leave the research associates as well
alone. But I don’t think that I did enough or we did enough at that time to
move those forward.
Devaney: In other words, you’re talking about the report you wrote in 1971 about the
status of women.
You mentioned in that report something about research associates and
lecturers who are people usually with Ph.D.’s in their field but they’re not
faculty, so they have staff positions that don’t have the prestige or the role of
a faculty member, and that they were overlooked. Your point is they were
being overlooked in terms of equity issues and reviews of their salaries and
hiring, is that what you’re saying? And you didn’t push hard enough on those
issues?
Miner: [01:24:10] Right. It’s not that I wasn’t the only one who saw it. Even the
person who was in charge of the lecturers saw this issue. For example, they
were like a flexible workforce in the university, and there were many--mostly
women in the lectures, the language lectures, for example, and it was not a
good situation. It was clearly gender-related because of the roles in society, of
sex roles in society. Nobody understood, but in retrospect, I would have
been more aggressive or maybe even at least before I left, before I went
away, I would have taken a half year and gone back and said, “Here’s my--.” I
would have attempted not to collude by my silence with our absence in the
ability to solve some of those questions.

186

But let me be clear. I see now in some cases, like even in that one,
some of those two, the lecturers and the research associates who have
Ph.D.’s but are not in tenure-track faculty, some of that is structural and
almost impossible to solve. They weren’t solvable in the sense that, we’ll just
flip the job-title system. It’s not like it was bad will that caused it, but I would
have put my own energy a little more into making sure that something
happened that was good.
Devaney: I think you are forgetting your success with respect to research associates, in
fact, because of your recommendations, every research associate and senior
research associate appointment and salary was reviewed every year and the
regression analyses done, and we’d compare it, because that was my job at
the time.
Miner: [01:25:54] When did that start?
Devaney: In the ’70s. We compared women and minority salaries, and to the extent
that there was a statistically significant difference in their salaries. And there
always was every year. We went back to the deans every year to say, “Either
show us that they are not as good performers or raise their salaries,” and
every year the salaries got raised. You made an impact that you don’t even
remember.
Miner: [01:26:20] My whole trip here has been worth this, because I can cross that
off my guilt list. Seriously, I’m not kidding, that’s fabulous. I did not know
that.
The other one I was going to say was that the salary-equity one where
we did do things, my impression is it maybe still never went far enough so

187

that probably later, at least on the fact we didn’t have to go redo that--that’s
true. Again, it’s not that I think it wasn’t enough. It’s that I personally wish at
the end I had kind of gone back and said, “Here are the ones that I suggest
to you cannot be solved in a one-cycle solution.”
Devaney: The problem is it didn’t get solved even then, because ten years later, we
were still going back every year to the deans saying, “You’ve got to raise your
salaries or show that they’re not as good.”
Miner: [01:27:16] Back to this learning thing, I feel like my career perspective would
have helped me then, I now grasp that there are many things like that in
organizations, one being some things about strategic planning. They just
forget and relearn, forget and relearn. In Wisconsin, which is in some ways
very radical, same thing, they wake up one day and say, “Let’s look at gender
and salary. Oh, wow, it’s amazing. It’s not the same.” [laughs]
It’s important if people would come to a different framing, which is
this is not like there’s a single action of evil that creates the patterns by
gender or minorities. It’s like many micro processes in our society, and they
just keep repeating, so that institutionally you would say, “We should go back
to what we were doing then.” It’s like your health. You don’t say, “I ate
breakfast. That’s the last time I’ll eat breakfast.” No, you eat breakfast every
day. These processes for maybe another half a century, maybe a whole
century, maybe forever, I don’t know,
Devaney: It would be interesting to go back to see if they’re doing the progression
analyses anymore on research associate salaries, and if not, why not?, I don’t
know if they do such analyses for salaries of the faculty or lecturers.

188

Miner: [01:28:30] I don’t either. All I’m saying here is that I now fully understand
that those were not doable in a single stroke, and I didn’t understand that
then. Then I was too hopeful about the beachhead. Now I would have been
more realistic and said, “Here’s my suggestion that you light an eternal flame
to salary equity, and then every year you’re going to visit it again.”
But I’m thrilled to hear that you were actually doing that. I didn’t know
that.
Devaney: Do you have any other reflections about your career that you would like to
share here?
Miner: [01:29:04] About my career. Well, only to repeat this. This is not quite the
same thing. Not only are the research universities amazing institutions where
knowledge creation and dissemination, sharing it is the point; what that
means if you are a faculty member in a field that you like is that it’s the most
amazing occupation in the world. I am paid to wake up in the morning and
say, “I wonder if improvisation works like this.” That’s my job. I mean, can
you imagine? That’s my job. It’s like every now and then you say, “Oh, no,
this can’t be, that they’re actually letting me do this.”
[01:30:00] And paying me to do it. [laughs] Then if you actually later get
respect and prestige, and I’ll admit to this. It’s a funny one. After I had these
job offers from Northwestern and Wharton at Wisconsin, which is itself a
pretty good school, I came back, and people who before then--this includes
faculty--were nice to me, this is the opposite of the women in the meeting
story.

189

[01:30:32] I would be in a meeting and I would say, “I think we should
do x,” and they would write it down. [laughs] Had nothing to do with me.
Nothing, right? But it was a pleasure. That’s not really the deep joy, because
that’s transient and it goes away, but it is fun, I will say that.
Devaney: By the way, why did you turn those other job offers down?
Miner: [01:30:49] I did because I had a son who was going to school about two
hours from Madison, and I went and spent a year to decide. I visited those
places and I seriously considered them. They looked better, let me put it that
way. They looked better on the surface. But two things. One is we had a new
dean coming in at Wisconsin who didn’t really understand how little money
he had. [laughs] He’d come from a private school, and he just didn’t realize
how resource-constrained he was. He matched what they did, and they were
having a little bidding war, so the cost to me, in terms of resources, was
almost zero. It was good what they offered.
The other one was, given that, I visited an apartment in Philadelphia of
a top faculty member there who’d come from Northwestern, and it was
gorgeous. It was this beautiful old house. But there was a room that was his
college-age son’s room, and I looked at the room, and I could see that the
person had never been there. The reason was his son went back to where
they lived before, because he’d just gotten out of high school, his friends
were all in the old town. I thought, “Whoa. That’s what will happen to me.
I’ll move to Chicago or Philadelphia, and my son will go back to Madison.” I
didn’t like that. I thought it’d be more fun to be near. So it was a mixture of

190

personal plus UW, and I was very involved with these technology startups,
and I knew everybody, and it looked like it’d be an easier path.
Devaney: In retrospect, was it the right decision?
Miner: [01:32:26] I think so.
Devaney: Do you have any advice for young women who start out today in academic
careers?
Miner: [01:32:32] You mentioned you meet people who say they did want to do this,
right, that you think there’s more women now who say, “I saw astronaut--.”
Devaney: I see young women who seem to have had more clarity as children that they
wanted to be in nontraditionally female jobs and somehow were encouraged
by their parents to do it, unlike in our generation.
Miner: [01:33:02] Right, or by role models or whatever. Assuming that there’s more
like that, I guess the first piece of advice would be obvious, which is what’s
in every women’s magazine, just don’t be discouraged, that you should heed
the inner call. I do think for many people, I definitely think for me,
participating in research universities is a calling. I don’t know if you’ve ever
read this thing called A Scholar’s Quest, written by James March, who was my
advisor at Stanford, when he was retiring, He has this paragraph that’s
something like there’s more pressure on universities to see it as a business
and the students as clients and all that. He says, “No, no.” It’s very hokey,
but I read from this often at, like, a dinner event for technology startups. He
says, “No, a university is more properly seen as a temple, and students are
more properly seen as acolytes, and so the vision of what this all is about is

191

not all utilitarian.” It’s not just that the knowledge is useful. I don’t know, but
it’s the human spirit that’s being honored here.
And I believe that. I think I always had that impulse. So this young
woman, or any person, I would say that may be a part of who you are, in
which case you want to honor that, really. I do that a lot with doctoral
students. In my own early phase at Wisconsin, my outside advisor, who was
advising me when there was opposition to me, would always take me back
and say, “Now remind me, why did you--?” He’d say to me, “Why did you
get into this?” Because I was often into political analysis of how to win the
struggle. And he’d say, “Why did you do this?”
I’d say, to go back to that, “Because I want to find out and realize what
in me has something to contribute to the creation of new knowledge. That’s
why I’m doing this.”
He’d say to me, my advisor, “My suggestion is go in every day, keep
that in mind, and everything you do, make it aimed at that, not at the feeding,
the tenure system, all that stuff.”
I believe that’s true, so I think that’s important. It is a complex
occupation, so for anybody who’s getting in it, if you’re going to advise them,
on the one hand, you want to encourage them to keep that inner flame as the
point. In the end, in my experience, that prevailed. That worked. I didn’t ever
have to become somebody I wasn’t. In fact, I became more who I am. That’s
one piece of advice.
The other piece of advice, which might seem contradictory, is that it
also has this not religious, but possibly spiritual element to it, which we don’t

192

talk about in public because in our culture it’s not a respectable thing. It isn’t
like what we do in public institutions. We don’t talk about the spiritual aspect
of doing administration. It doesn’t mean it’s not there, I’m just saying it’s not
part of the acceptable discourse. In a way what I’m saying is it’s okay to do
that, in the first piece of advice.
The second piece of advice, even given that, especially given that, it is a
brutal, competitive occupation, I said before--and this is a problem that I
think is gender-specific, not only women. When I work with junior faculty,
when I mentor junior faculty, part of what I work on is back with the staff,
the Tooth Fairy syndrome. There’s a kind of belief that if you’re a good girl,
you’ll be rewarded, and so to get rid of that. It’s not true. You will not get
rewarded if you’re a good girl or boy.
Then to get a sense of yourself that sees the organization as a political
system, it’s neutral, it’s indifferent, it’s not bad, this is how it is, and I would
encourage young women, if we’re talking women, but anybody who’s been
marginal before--this applies to everything, handicapped, anybody that wasn’t
the dominant core group has got to, in my opinion, accept the fact that it’s
still a transition. I was joking the other day, and still to this day, it’ll happen.
[laughs] Same thing with university presidents in some meeting or something.
or very high-powered people, and a person will turn away from me, a man
will turn away from me, or even a woman will turn away from me or ignore
me, and there’s a little thought that goes through my mind saying, “Was that
because I’m a woman or is that because I have a stupid hairdo? Was that
because they’re sick and tired?”

193

What I finally saw is that ambiguity right there will not be gone maybe
ever, but certainly not for another fifty years, so my joke was that we should
give them combat pay, to all the deviants, whoever they are, because they
have to go through that crap in their brains and manage that.
But the other side of that is just to almost learn to enjoy it as a person
who’s a member of any out group, but this is okay. You’ve been honored by
the history of the world to have this job of being there and realizing yourself
under these conditions, but you want to respect that you have to be up for it
not always being fun.
[01:38:43] Don’t take it personally, but be willing to fight. Be willing to
kill, but don’t take it personally. That’s kind of the spirit. Those would be the
two. And have hope. [laughs]
Devaney: That’s great. This is kind of a strange question to ask somebody who’s
relatively young, but when you look back over your career, how would you
most like to be remembered?
Miner: [01:39:02] I will try to answer, though I haven’t thought much about it. You
left out one thing I thought you were going to ask me a little, which is what
do we see as the future. Maybe we did talk about that. But I just want to
comment more on that, what I see as happening. I think we did talk about
Stanford’s future and whether things are happening, and clearly, I think they
are getting better. The glass is not only half full, it’s getting fuller, although
it’s not where anybody wants it.
But it occurred to me recently being out here that an exciting thing
that’s going to be fun to watch is I think the STEM [science, technology,

194

engineering, and math] fields are different. I think we have not solved that
fundamental problem of women in these technology areas in a way that’s
different from the social sciences.
Devaney: But that goes back to elementary school.
Miner: [01:39:45] That’s the point, we think so. So the question, will it ever get
solved? We know that many--like we at Wisconsin have millions of dollars of
grants, and Stanford’s determined to fix this. That’s all going on. But to me,
an exciting, fun thing to watch is this very recent press out here in the Silicon
Valley where you have--and I don’t know how real this is--suddenly Google
or Facebook reporting exactly the kind of numbers we were talking about in
’71, and as they’re reporting publicly, we have this percent women, this
percent minorities, and-Devaney: You mean employees at these computer science-related businesses.
Miner: [01:40:24] Yes, from themselves. All of a sudden, the same picture, you
know. It was kind of taken for granted. It wasn’t seen as a big problem. I
mean, they accepted that women don’t go into--whatever it was, it wasn’t
seen as a big problem, but all of a sudden it looks like it’s going to be defined
as a problem, quote, “a problem,” for Google or Facebook or these
companies.
Devaney: Do you think, though, that’s because the heads of Google and Facebook,
first of all, they’re all young, and, second of all, they’re socially conscious and
they’re into empowerment of minorities of any kind and that they’re taking
this as one of their core missions is to get women interested in coding? That
was a headline in last week’s paper.

195

Miner: [01:41:03] Yes. But when you think that, get women interested in coding, it’s
not only saying that. If that’s the case, if they mean that, which I assume they
do, then you have something-Devaney: You now have business involved in making it happen.
Miner: [01:41:16] It’s like back to the Aikido [the martial art that emphasizes using
the energy of others] or, the sheepdog theory. You’d rather have big,
powerful social companies. Any institution that has a lot of money and
expertise and almost this very young kind of we don’t take for granted that
the past is right. It’s back to the ‘60s. It’s back to what is here now may not
be what should be. Typically, it’s corporations. They’re generally for that, and
they’ve done way more on affirmative action around staffs than the
university. But the thought that these very high-tech companies will tackle
the STEM question, that’s what’s novel here.
Many other corporations have already got women in HR and
marketing. But this question of the technical core, they haven’t solved either.
Nobody has solved it. I think it’s hilarious and wonderful and fun to think
that now these people they’re all driven by numbers. They really love number
games. If they’re not getting anywhere, they’re going to know they’re not
getting anywhere. If there aren’t any women coders, they’re going to know
that in five years. I think that’s going to be very interesting.
Devaney: Yes. I think that in the past, I don’t remember of any industry leaders, you
know, Ford Motor Company, caring about how many women assembly-line
people they have.

196

Miner: [01:42:34] They actually did. Actually, the assembly line they do better, but
they-Devaney: No, but I mean back in the ‘40s and ‘50s, we’re talking about now you’ve got
the actual executives, the leaders themselves, who are making this something
that they really passionately care about.
Miner: [01:42:48] You have to be really careful, because they actually did care and
did do it about minorities at the time, I mean, since the ‘60s.
Also women in general. They have women in marketing. I just talked to
a woman insurance person and they integrated all these professions, but
where everybody failed, or relatively speaking, couldn’t crack that kind of
critical-mass question that you’re talking about, however many women there
are, they’re still tiny and it’s hard, it’s in the STEM fields. What’s different
here is there’s a corporate--actually, the reason engineering schools have been
able to do good things often is the companies say, “Help! Help! We need
more women engineers,” so that everybody’s been together on that, but it
hasn’t been cracked. It’s more like a new set of commercial players have
decided to take it seriously, and that is one of the happy, happy ones.
Another weird happy one, which maybe is not so good to end on, but
it’s going to be interesting, I believe, is we didn’t talk a lot about this, but
there’s the sexual harassment, sex issue, the climate of the relationships of
men and women in terms of sexuality and saying yes or no and all that sort
of thing. We talked about the steamfitters putting the naked picture up in the
steam plant. But this current issue in higher education of the women students
and they’re complaining about men, mostly undergraduates, right, what does

197

it mean to say no, and are the women students protected enough from the
predatory male undergraduate, is a very tough problem. I think that it’s a sign
of another turn of the wheel in terms of the level of sophistication we’ll
finally get to about power and sex and these sex roles, and why was it this
kind of a male who persists--so I find that hopeful, not because it will be a
simple solution but to solve it, which I think will happen.
I don’t think it was solved even back then. We didn’t even understand
how bad it was, probably. I think that’ll be a good thing in terms of women’s
power--I was involved in an undergraduate dorm for several years recently,
and they did training, they did skits on what does it mean to say no.
Devaney: You’re talking about student behavior.
Miner: [01:45:17] Sex--with each other, just with each other. They run seminars in
dorms, and we have very serious efforts to solve these things. They have a
skit and it’s about if the woman says no, does she mean no, is that just a way
to flirt. It’s good because the women are learning from this whole issue. It’s
don’t blame the victim, but on the other hand, shouldn’t I have some role in
taking care of myself. The men are learning. Some of these men are not
coming from sophisticated environments, they really never have thought
about the problem that a drunk woman saying nothing is not the same as yes.
I think, actually, all that will replay and touch deeper on the link between
gender and power in ways that will be healthy for everybody.
Devaney: Let’s come back to how you would like to be remembered. Both in the world
and at Stanford.

198

Miner: [01:46:19] [laughs] At Stanford I’d like to be remembered as a person, it was
like you were there, you were there at a great time. You were part of a great
time. And I’d like to be remembered as a person who was not only there and
contributing, but I was part of this bigger fabulous era of once more
attempting to remake the institution, take it to its higher level. Not one that
solved everything but that did establish a beachhead, and that was done with
some grace, in my opinion, and certainly a lot of joy. I mean, it doesn’t sound
strange, but it was a joyful project because the vision was so positive, and it
wasn’t just the justice vision. That was good, but it was more this idea we
could have a place that would create better knowledge for everybody and
students would reach their potential more. That would be fun to be
remembered that way.
Devaney: Indeed you did have a great positive influence on the fabric of Stanford’s
history. No question.
Miner: [01:47:25] I hope so. In general, I don’t know if I would have thought about
it, but when I ran the Affirmative Action Office, one thing I did--I think it’s
because of my imprinting in the Development Office of fundraising--was we
had these parties. I would have parties, and a Hawaiian party, as I recall--I
don’t know if that’s possible--for everybody. Someone said, “This is like
going to a wedding. This is like nuts. What are you doing?” It was deliberate
in the sense I wanted to take away the notion of affirmative action as the
policeman and you don’t want to go near them because you’ll get in trouble.
But also it was fun. I feel that I would hope that if people remember me in
the world, some people think I’m very serious, but I hope they would

199

remember me as a person who did, in the end, join into the joy of all this
stuff we can do as people and that it more or less worked.
Devaney: I can say, for one, that I enjoyed your Hawaiian parties, and we did have a
great time in those days.
Thank you very much, Anne Miner.
