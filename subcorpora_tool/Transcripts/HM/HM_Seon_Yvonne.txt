Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: The name is Yvonne, Seon, S-E-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay and Yvonne is?
Speaker 2: Y-V-O-N-N-E, Yvonne.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is your maiden name?
Speaker 2: Reed, R-E-E-D.  My father used to say the Reed with no eyes.  He is blind.
Speaker 1: Now Seon is a, is a unusual name, at least for us in Maryland here.  How, how did you get that name?
Speaker 2: I, I chose that name after my divorce from my children's father as the--it was the name of my great-grandmother.  Her name was Ida Seon, and Seon is an Ethiopian, of Ethiopian derivation.  She--by way of the West Indies, her family came to the West Indies from Ethiopia and the name means Zion.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Washington, D.C. in 1937, December 20.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am Associate Professor of African American Studies at Prince George's Community College in Maryland [Largo, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is Monday, July 14 I believe, 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at my home.

Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions we ask.  They just require a short answer.  Ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I think I like spaghetti with marinara sauce.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you like--I mean what, what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I'm tempted to say blue, but I think orange is probably more truthful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of year would be Spring time, Summer gets a little bit too hot, although I prefer heat to cold.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I like the West Indies and I like California also because of the weather there.  Those, those two places.  But I think the West Indies because you can get a combination of mountain and ocean in a way that you can't anywhere else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: You can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar (laughter).
Story_ID: 168513
Speaker 1: All right now I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  How far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: Sometimes I think I can go back to the beginning because of the Seon family name.  The Seon family name is an Ethiopian name that--what can I say, is derived--it's--well part of the name of the royal family of Ethiopia.  So my grandmother always traced the family lineage back to Solomon and Sheba, which carries it biblically we, we can go all the way back to Adam and Eve through that, through that side of the family.  In a more direct way, I can go back to at least my great-grandmother, at least four generations back on my mother's side to Grenada in the British West Indies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories passed down through the family about life in the 19th century or life, I don't know--
Speaker 2: In the 1800s?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, lots of them on both sides of the family.  On my father's [George Reed] side of the family, I think I'll mention that simply because it connects more with African American history.  My father tells stories about his Uncle Jim.  My father was a foster child in the foster system here in Washington, D.C., but his, his foster mother had a sister who was married to a Civil War, I'll have to say hero.  And he told, often told stories of having been first of all, impressed by the Virginia Army as a young man of about eighteen, and having fled to the Union Army, having had a price on his head, having been at Gettysburg [Pennsylvania] with a gun under, under somebody's bed hiding from, from Confederate forces and so forth.  He--I'm sure--he tells stories also of his strength and of, of being able to haul wagons or, or manipulate the horses.  So I suspect that that his work was as a, a bearer or--
Speaker 1: Teamster.
Speaker 2: Teamster.  Yes, he may have been a teamster.  He may have been helping to put the gunpowder in the, in the guns and that sort of thing at the Battle of Gettysburg and, and who knows where else in the war.
Speaker 1: So this is your, your father's Uncle Jim.
Speaker 2: That's Uncle Jim.  I went down to the monument, the Shaw Monument which has the names of, of Civil--African Americans in the Civil War.  And I found the name of his foster mother's husband who was a veteran.
Speaker 1: In the fifty-fourth Massachusetts [regiment]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure which unit he was in.
Speaker 1: That's the--well the monument is dedicated to the men who were in the 54th Massachusetts regiment.
Speaker 2: There, there a number, there a number of monuments or of regiments listed there, so I don't remember which one he was in.  They're listed by regiment and I'm not sure which one he was in, but it may have been, may well have been the 54th, yeah.
Story_ID: 168514
Speaker 1: Okay anything else passed down through your family?
Speaker 2: Yes on the other side of the family, I get a strong picture of the West Indies in the latter part of the 19th century.  My grandmother remembers both of her great-grandmothers.  One as a young girl, one was in her, one was--both were over 100.  And she says one would be smoking a corncob pipe and the other one would be carried out on a basket.  She was small and frail at the age of 103 or four [104] the sun for a few hours.  I guess that's part of the secret of a long life.  Yeah, yeah.  She knew also that her grandmother, one grandmother was from the French West Af--was from French West Africa.  And had been brought to the West Indies from there as a young girl.  So that's a direct tie to the slave, to slavery.  On the other side, the Seon family apparently three Seon brothers came to the West Indies by way of Scotland, probably in the 1850s or 60s [1860s] in order to work on boating.  Each one went to a different island and so they settled in Barbados, Grenada and Trinidad.  But our branch of the family, my grand--Ida Seon was from Barbados, but had moved to Grenada and David Seon was the Seon or the elder of the family on the island of Grenada.  So he attended, and I found the records to prove this, he attended the wedding of Ida Seon, my great-grandmother.  He attended my grandmother's wedding, and he was also present for the baptism of my mother [Beatrice Reed].  So a lot of continuity in this, what he called himself the octogenarian great-grand uncle, lot of continuity in there.
Story_ID: 168515
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us about your, your mother first?  I'm gonna ask you about your father too, but your--if you can tell--give us your mother's full name and spell it for us and her date and place of birth.
Speaker 2: My mother was born Beatrice Beakes, B-E-A-K-E-S.  She later was--came to the United States with her mother and she was adopted by Holly C. Murray, M-U-R-R-A-Y.  After that, along with, along with her sister, her sister is Ida also.  And after that, she married my father, so she is Beatrice, B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E Beakes Murray Reed, R-E-E-D.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what, what was she like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: She was--by the way she was born in Grenada, British West Indies in 1916.  I think she came to this country in about 1936, 1930--somewhere between 1934 and 1936.  She was a real estate broker.  She died in 1999, but she'd been a, a strong member of the community.  What else?  She had been among the African American first, she was the first African American woman--the first African American to be part of a, an international union.  She was an organizer for the Congress of Industrial Organizations, CIO, which later affiliated with the AF of L [American Federation of Labor].  She was there for, for a number of years.  She also worked during the Civil Rights era, pre-Civil Rights era, in the 1940s, with the local chapter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  She was the executive, she was the ass--administrative assistant to the executive director of the local chapter.  At that time it was Eugene Debbs [sic, Eugene Davidson].  What that meant was that people like Thurgood Marshall and Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston] and Andy Ransom [Leon Andrew Ransom] were people that she knew well and worked with in, in their, their sortes [ph.] into the south to get information for Civil Rights cases.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that's--she--all right.
Speaker 2: And she, she, she was present on a lot of the--during some of those strategy sessions where they would figure out what they were going to do and how they were going to get material for a case and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is important 'cause this is the--kind of the center of the storm (unclear).  These are the people that actually planned a lot of that NAACP activity and it blossoms into the Civil Rights Movement later on.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The--these were some of the foundation activities.  Cases like Charlie Houston had set up a number of those cases, but cases like the one in the interstate to provide African American access to seating wherever they wanted to be in interstate travel.  These cases--that was much--long before the Brown versus Board of Education [1954] case.  But that was the era in which she was active with the NAACP lawyers.
Speaker 1: Right, right, this is like the beginnings of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It would have been in the--around '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: How long did she do that kind of work?
Speaker 2: I don't remember how long.  I, I remember some of the cases which again, I, I was, I was a young girl at the time, pre-teens.  And I remember one case in particular where Mother called from Baltimore to say that she couldn't come home and would I fix dinner--my father [George Reed] and I would fix dinner because she was dealing with a woman named Polly who had been found in a shed in a house where she'd been kept in virtual slavery.  She was being fed on chicken heads and feet.  She could not talk.  They had to judge her age based on looking at her teeth and they guessed her to be about the age of eighteen.  This was not, not 100 years ago, but in the 19, in the 1940s.
Speaker 1: Now this--where was this lady?
Speaker 2: In Baltimore, Maryland, in Baltimore, Maryland.  So close by.  That was one case.  Another case that I remember well.  She helped to integrate the swimming pool facilities at nearby Air Force base.  This would be--can't remember the name of the base, Fort McNair [Washington, D.C.], not too far from here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In, in the District of Columbia.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what kind of personality did your mother have?  What was she like?
Speaker 2: I take that back.  I'm not sure if it would be Fort McNair, it would have been Bolling, Bolling [Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, D.C.] Air Force Base in south, southeast.
Story_ID: 168516
Speaker 1: What kind of personality?  My mother [Beatrice Reed] was a bubbly personality.  Free spirited, energetic, high energy.  She believed in organizing as a solution to problems, and she was a, she was very good at it because of her union background.  So she worked with a number of organizations.  She, she was president of, at one time of the Caribbean American Intercultural organization.  It just--she was the kind of person who liked to teach and so she wouldn't just organize, but she taught others how to organize, how to do--how to accomplish their goals.  And so she was very well respected.  I discovered when she passed, when she died in '99 [1999], I discovered how much she had done, including involvement with the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill and some of the Congressional staff in, in lobbying and, and helping them to work on issues that were part of their concerns.
Speaker 2: Now did she ever train any of the Civil Rights workers that went into the south?  Organizing?
Speaker 1: Not rally trained.  She worked with Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] who was down in, I guess it was--what do they call it?
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: The Co-op in Mississippi, yes.  She had worked with him in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at one time.  So a lot of the people who went into the Civil Rights Movement had come out of the, the NAACP and their, and their organizing activities of the 1940s and '50s [1950s].  So that's as close as she--I can claim for her as a role in, in training the Civil Rights Movement leaders.  But that leadership was really younger and my mother used to say she was fifty years ahead of her time, which meant that she probably had finished most of that activity before the real thrust of the Civil Rights Movement came about in the late '50s [1950s] and early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: You know if she was associated at all with the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee [later, Highlander Research and Education Center]?  Did she ever go there to do anything?
Speaker 1: No, not to my knowledge.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 168517
Speaker 1: Well tell me about your, your father.  Can you give us his full name and date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father is George Raymond Reed, R-E-E-D, George, G-E-O-R-G-E.  Born in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] in 1911.  His--you need his birthday?  November, November 18, 1911 in D.C.  He was--his, his mother was believed to be Bertha, I'm sorry, his mother was believed to be Ethel Ford Reed.  And you find various spellings of that, with the I and without the I.  But she died--he was told that she died shortly after he was born, and that was how he got into the, in to the board--I think they called it the Board of Children's Guardians at that time.  But the, the District of Columbia Board of Children's Welfare, equivalent to that, in the early 19, in the early 1900's.
Speaker 1: So this was an orphanage--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  He was in the system, so to speak, as an orphan from very, very young.  By the time he was five years old, he had begun school at the D.C. children, blind children went to, went to school in the Maryland School for the Blind which was segregated of course at that time.  So he grew, he grew up at the Maryland School for the Blind in Overly, Maryland, very close to Baltimore, outside of Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's blind?
Speaker 2: Yes, he's been blind from birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well tell us what, what he's like and what did he do for a living.
Speaker 2: My father worked in the Randolph-Sheppard Program from early on.  He was one of the first African Americans to be hired in that program, which assisted blind people in getting vending stands in government buildings.  And they used that as, as their way of earning a living.  So he was, he, he started--he was in that program for nearly all of my life.  And as one of the first African Americans in the program, he suffered a lot, you know the, the worst stands.  He would build them up and then they'd be taken away from him and he'd have to start all over again with another bad stand.  So that happened early on.  But at the same time, it was an opportunity for him to be a, a way-shower and a leader in terms of oth--for other African Americans who went into the program as the years went on.  He--in terms of his personality, a good sense of humor, he plays the piano.  In fact he was a concert pianist at one point.  He would give concerts generally for charity or generally for benefit activities around town.  And I think that's how he met my mother [Beatrice Reed] in fact.
Speaker 1: Now where was he trained as a, as a--
Speaker 2: As a musician?
Speaker 1: Yeah, as a musician.
Speaker 2: At the Overly School.  They had a, apparently a strong music program because at that time it was believed that, that being a musician or tuning pianos were among the few things that were open to African American blind.  They didn't have many choices in terms of the kind of job.  My father always wanted to be a mathematician, but he was discouraged from doing that.  When he left Overly, he decided to get a high school diploma from Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.], even though he had read every book in Braille in the Maryland School for the Blind.  So he had quite an education at that point when he left the school at age eighteen or nineteen I believe.  But he did come to, to Dunbar and complete his, his high school diploma in about a year and a half.  And in so doing, he became the first African American to be mainstreamed in the public schools.  He may have been the first person to be mainstreamed in the public--the first blind person to be mainstreamed in the public school system.  That's kind of normal these days, but this would have been in the 1920s and early--no, this would have been in the 1930s.  He, he's a graduate of 1933 from Dunbar, class of 1933.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now do you have any siblings?
Speaker 2: I should add to that.  My father went on to graduate summa cum laude from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] in history and English in 1937, class of 1937.
Speaker 1: That's an important addition (laughter).
Story_ID: 168518
Speaker 1: Now you asked the question about siblings.  I was raised as an only child, but you know, you know what they say about that.  We know, we know about our mothers, we don't always know about our fathers; I may have some siblings.
Speaker 2: All right, well tell us about growing up, you know, what side of Washington, D.C. did, were you raised in?
Speaker 1: I was raised in Northeast Washington, D.C. in a, a development called Langston Terrace , low income housing for, at that time it was low income housing for people who were just starting out and it was a way for them to get started.  It was subsidized housing.  And it was run by--as--it was run as an experiment.  It was really an experiment in that kind of development.  We--some very interesting people came out of that neighborhood, including I believe Eloise Greenfield, an African American writer.  So we have had alumni meetings from people were, were in that first--I call it the first class.  They were living at Langston when it was first opened, and I'm one of those (laughter).
Story_ID: 168519
Speaker 1: I was just saying that these early housing, subsidized housing units were sought after and they were well kept and you know, usually I mean that's the way it was in Chicago [Illinois] and other cities. I don't know if it was the same thing here.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes very well kept.  Very--a lot of pride in the neighborhood.  We were close to an elementary school that was also pioneering in terms of offering the opportunity from the elementary level for people to go to specialists in their field.  So you changed classes.  We took geography from a geography teacher, and English from a specialist in English, and math from a person who had a Ph.D. in mathematics.  And so we, we had a strong faculty there.  And a strong dra--we had a Drama Department and a Music Department in the school.  And that's so--that, that spirit carried over into the, the neighborhood, into the housing development too.  We had a library and a recreation center in the housing development.  So it was a, a strong community building--the area was, was strong for community.  It was a, it was a real community in those days.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the grade school that you attended?
Speaker 2: The grade school was Charles Young Elementary School, named after the--one of the first African American officers in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Colonel, yeah colonel--
Speaker 2: He was Colonel Charles Young, that's correct.  So this would have been the Colonel Charles Young Elementary School.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 168520
Speaker 1: Now, can you reflect back on growing up and give us a, an example of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Interesting question.  One of the things I remember about growing up was the Mayday celebrations when we danced around the maypole and I, I have--I still have a picture from elementary school when we were doing the ele--the maypole dance on the playground of, of Charles [E.] Young Elementary School [Northeast, Washington, D.C.].  I remember rolling down the hill for--after Easter eggs behind the school on occasion as well.  So there were some of the things--the activities that I remember.  I remember going down to the recreation center which was in my building, and playing, playing checkers and the irony was there were a lot of people who were older than I was who would play down there.  But I would always win at checkers.  I was excellent in those days.  I haven't been able to play checkers much since I grew up.  I think there's something about the mindset there.  Farther away--I remember taking music lessons during those days and I remember traveling by streetcar to do that.  I remember that on the weekends we had these streetcar passes and people would go back and forth.  They would use the pass on Sunday to go to the movies or to take their families out because it allowed for wider access and you could take one person on a pass free with one guest free.  So it gave, it gave families a, a chance to do things on the weekends and I remember being part of that.  Sights and smells and sounds.  We always had dinner on the weekends, on Sunday with my grandmother.  And so that was part of the background of, of, of my growing up too.  Saint Luke's Episcopal Church in Washington D.C. on 15th and Church Streets was another part of growing up.  I rarely went with my family.  My mother [Beatrice Reed] had a bad experience when she got here being taken off her knees while visiting a church.  And so she stopped going to church as a result.  But I was always mindful of that West Indian-Anglican background and so I grew up in Saint Luke's Episcopal Church where I was baptized.
Speaker 1: So, so you kind of went on your own?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went--or with other family members.  My aunt was active in the church.  And sometimes later with friends my own age who were a part of the church.
Story_ID: 168521
Speaker 1: Well what kind of little girl were you?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: What did I like to do when I was little.  That's a good question.  On one hand I had a reputation of being--I hate to use the term, Miss Goody Two Shoes.  I had a very unusual learning style and so my friends would always wonder how did I get good grades all the time when they never saw me study.  I think they--some were a little jealous of that.  Sometimes I would forget things; I forgot things a lot, but it was because I would unclutter my mind periodically and keep, and go on and get the new stuff.  I liked to--I liked to play on the play--I think I may have been a bit of a tomboy.  I had--I think I may have been a bit of a tomboy.  I played with the fellas as well as with the girls.  But I remember--one of the things I remember is I got teased a lot.  I had long hair and gray eyes and I got teased a lot and one of the persons who teased me, put--a friend of mine.  I won't mention his name on the film, camera.  But he took my hair, my plait one day and dipped the end of it in the inkwell.  You remember the desks with the inkwells.  Then when the teacher came down the row, he took scissors, the little scissors that they put in our equipment box and cut it off so there would be no evidence.  So I had one plait shorter than the other.  And I remember chasing him home very well.  So does that tell what kind of little girl I was?  In some ways I think I was shy, but I was a tomboy (laughter).
Story_ID: 168522
Speaker 1: Tell me about grade school [at Charles Young Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], what was grade school like?
Speaker 2: Grade school.  As I said, we changed classes after a certain point.  I remember being involved in the, the musical, in the choir.  We had--and we, we had a girl sextet.  I was one of the six girls in the sextet and I sang alto.  I remember that we traveled and went to --performed at various places in town with that, and sometimes we would do pageants and activities through the Drama Department as well.  Grade school was a fun time for me, but the thing I remember most of all are the teachers.  Like I said, we had some very strong teachers and--
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the names of the teachers?
Speaker 2: Harry Lewis [ph.] who taught English.  I took mathematics from Lorraine Hethcock [sic, Lorraine Whitlock] who just recently-- she just recently died, but she'd been head of the Mathematics Department here in the District of Columbia for many years after she left Young.  I'm sorry, not Hethcock, but Whitlock, Lorraine Whitlock.  Who else did I know?  Mrs. Reed, R-E--Gladys, I think her first name was Gladys, Mrs. Reid, R-E-I-D, who taught music.  She was a large woman and she, she often directed the choirs, the choir, and I still can see her at the piano and standing, leading the choir and the sextet in, in song.  So we had a, we had a wonderful staff there.  As I said, it was a strong staff too and I have warm memories.  Some of, some of the people that I met there, I have one friend, my best friend is someone I met in kindergarten at elementary school.
Story_ID: 168523
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about high, high school?  Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Dunbar High School in--I guess that's in Washington D.--down--in downtown Washington, D.C. in the Shaw neighborhood near my grand--near where my grandmother lived.  Interestingly enough, my, my aunt had also gone to that same high school some years before and my, my father [George Reed].  So it was an inter-generational thing.  My father, my aunt and I all have gone to Dunbar High School.  Dunbar was the school--what I would call the academic high school of its day.  It was the school from which most of the students went to, went on to college.  And again, a professional staff, a lot of people with Ph.D. degrees and so forth.  We had a strong Math Department, a strong French Department, a strong English Department.  And so--
Speaker 1: Is this where you studied French first?
Speaker 2: Yes, I first studied French in high school.  Of course I had to study Latin as well.  I don't remember the Latin teachers nearly as much, but--I remember the teacher, I don't remember the, the class or the learning as much, but I, I do remember I, I--in fact I had started Latin in junior high school.  I went to Banneker Junior High School, which is now a model high school.  But it was again one of those schools that had a reputation for academic excellence.  And fed, fed into Dunbar High School very often.  I was, I was salutatorian there.
Speaker 1: So you had good grades and you were--
Speaker 2: There were five, there were five--that, the school was excellent.  Just to give you an idea, the year that I graduated, we had four valedictorians and there were five of us who were eligible for salutatorian.  And the only reason that I won out was because I had taken more classes than the others and so I had a, a slight, very slightly higher grade point, but we all had just one B.
Speaker 1: A lot of good students, high standards.
Speaker 2: High stand--very high standards.  We had a unit of ROTC [Reserves Officers' Training Corps] there as well and we often won the competitions, the regional competitions for drill, the drill team, our drill team was excellent, outstanding.
Speaker 1: Now, now how does D.C. Dunbar compare with Dunbar in Baltimore [Maryland]?  Was there--
Speaker 2: I don't know that we competed in any way, in any real way.  I think that many cities in that time period were--had a Dunbar High School.  Something named for Paul Laurence Dunbar.  And I think that stood for something in all of them.  It stood for this is where you go for academic excellence, for liberal arts background.  And I think that was true for Baltimore as well as for D.C. in that, in that timeframe.  The, the Washington Dunbar however, did have a reputation for excellence that, that was nationwide.
Speaker 1: All right, now what kinds of activities were you involved in, in high --were you involved in any --were you still singing in high school?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I'm trying to remember if I was singing in high school.  I remember being involved the yearbook staff and the Honors Club and the French Club.  I don't remember --I wasn't much for sports, so I wasn't involved in any of the varsity activities or anything of that sort.  I don't remember whether--I think we had a Drama Club and I was part of that.  I have my yearbook somewhere here so I may be able to show that to you before the end of things.  But those were--quill and pen.  I like to write and I did write for the school newspaper as well.  That's where I got my start in journalism.  I was, I was part of the school newspaper at Dunbar and later part of the school newspaper in college.
Story_ID: 168524
Speaker 1: When you were, you were on the verge of graduation [from Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.], did you know where you were gonna go to school?  Had you already planned that out?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  The yes is that I had applied for a scholarship through the United Negro College Fund and I'd gotten some information and I had picked a school that I thought I would be interested in from the list of schools that they sent me of, of schools that were involved with their program.  I had picked Allegheny College [Meadville, Pennsylvania].  I think it was close to time to--for--it was close to the end of the school year before I finally made the choice and knew that I was accepted at Allegheny.
Story_ID: 168525
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to Allegheny?
Speaker 2: I went to Allegheny College [Meadville, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Tell us about A--Allegheny College and how you liked that.
Speaker 2: I liked Allegheny because it was in a small town.  And I liked the, the--and it was a small college.  I think there were only about 1,200 students there.
Speaker 1: Is that in Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: In Penn--it's in, it's in the mountains of Pennsylvania, northern Pennsylvania up near Lake Erie, as a matter of fact.  Harsh winters; didn't like that so much.  Lot of snow.  But in the Springtime it was beautiful.  They had rhododendron bushes and, and a lot of flora and fauna that I found soothing as a person who'd grown up in the, in the city.  I liked being around nature; I liked being outdoors.  They had horses too, but I couldn't get into horseback riding.  What did I do there?  I was active--again the kind of interpersonal activities.  I was president of the International Relations Club.  I was a Cwen, which was an organization for outreach to the freshman students.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: C-W-E-N.  It's an old English word for queen.  We had a small group that would serve as mentors to the freshman students in their sophomore year and I had been selected for that group.  I maintained good grades and very strong --in fact I graduated number three in my class at Allegheny College and I was cum laude.
Speaker 1: Okay now what was your major?
Speaker 2: I majored in the social sciences, political science was my major, with a strong minor in the social sciences and in French.

Speaker 1: Did you get involved in any of the black sororities on campus (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Sororities was an interesting question.  I got involved in what we call the independent group, a group of independents that was kind of counter-sorority.  At that time, there were no blacks being invited into the sororities at the school, and in fact when it was time for rushing, it was made very clear to me that I would not be invited to join a sorority.
Speaker 1: They made it very clear.
Speaker 2: They made it very clear to me.
Speaker 1: How did they make it clear?
Speaker 2: They had, they had some kind of an event where people would go and, and kind of shop.  There would be a kind of a shopping experience.  You shop for sororities, the sororities would, would rush the girls.  And in that event--I went to the event and I was told that I would not be rushed.  That was a factor of race, and it was very clear that that was what was going on.  This was in the 1950s of course, the end of the 1950s.
Speaker 1: Were there any black students at Allegheny?
Speaker 2: We only had twelve black students at the college at that time.  And of the twelve, one of the male students who was also from this area, did become a member of a fraternity there.  He was planning to go into medicine and the, the fraternity that was to --that liked to rush medical students did rush him and, and accept him.  But he was, as far as I can tell, as far as I know, he was the first only, for many years the only African American to be rushed by a fraternity.  And the, the girls didn't have that option.  The--that, that barrier had not been broken down at that time.
Speaker 1: But you--did you have any difficulty participating in other aspects of college life?
Speaker 2: No.  I had a lot of friends among the women who were independent and of, of spirit and of mind and who felt that in a sense they felt offended by the fact that the sororities would not rush me.  That was a part of their objection to being in sororities, and we remained friends and had our--had a strong bond among us.  So we--we formed an independent sorority if you would, a kind of grouping of independent minded people who were, who were also active on campus and in campus life.  And I was very active in other parts of campus life that did not depend on that, on the Greek letter, sororities.
Story_ID: 168527
Speaker 1: So you graduated from Allegheny [College, Meadville, Pennsylvania] in --what, what year was it?
Speaker 2: In 1959.
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959].  Okay, now what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Then I went for --I, I won a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.  And through that Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, I went to the American University in --where did I go--here in Washington, D.C.  The School of Government and Public Administration.  So I got a degree in one year--I only stayed one year.  I don't know why, but I was anxious to get on with my life.  I think I was in a hurry and impatient.  By that time I had been in school for about twenty-one years and I was ready to-twenty-one minus five--for about I guess seventeen years or so and, and I was ready to, to do something else.  I wanted to start living.  So I deliberately rushed through that degree.  I, I don't know if it was rushing through, I took fifteen credits each semester and I had earned mas--my master's degree at the end of the year.  I studied under Fritz Morstein Maws [ph.].  I'm sorry Fritz Morstein Marx who wrote, 'The God That Failed,' [sic, Arthur Koestler authored, 'The God That Failed'] and had been, he had been active in opposing Communism in that era.  He talked about having jumped off a bridge once to escape being shot and I, I found that very exciting.  I found it exciting to have him as a teacher of political theory.  We had a woman president of American University at the time, and because I was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, she supervised the internships for the, for a group of, of people in the school, in the graduate school.  And I had an internship under William Brook Graves of the Libraries of Congress.  He was the expert on political science and government for the Libraries of Congress.  I worked with him during a time when he was about to publish a book on the judicial system in America.  And he gave me credit, appropriate credit in his introduction for my role in that work.
Story_ID: 168528
Speaker 1: Now if my memory serves me correctly, I think around this time you met Patrice Lumumba.
Speaker 2: Yes I did.  It was shortly after I had graduated from the American University. I graduated from the American University [Washington, D.C.] in --it's be--it's just American University now, but I graduated in 1960.  And the Congo was on the verge of its independence.  In fact they received--they got independence from Belgium, Belgium in I think May of that year.  And Lumumba came to the United States seeking help in June.  When he came, the African Diplomatic Corps sponsored a party for him, a reception for him at the Mayflower Hotel.  And because of my mother's [George Reed] activism, she and a friend had been invited to that event.  She got caught working that day, she was a real--she was in real estate and she just worked late and I don't know whether she forgot or didn't get away in time.  But either way her friend called to find out where she was and why she hadn't heard from her.  And when she found out mother was working, she said "Well you come and go with me, Yvonne."  And, and I did.  And that was how I met Lumumba.  I didn't meet him that day.  He had--by the time I got there because I had gotten started late, the receiving line had broken, he was talking to--talking to reporters near the, near the entrance and I didn't interrupt.  But because of a guest at the party, someone suggested that I do interrupt.  I had to meet Lumumba; it was too much of an opportunity to miss.  He was just leaving as I got to where, where he had been standing and greeting people.  And one of his aides agreed to see to it that I would meet him the next day.  And after some conversation to try to find out who I was and why I needed to meet the President.  I explained to him that this was just what you do when you come to a reception, but nevertheless because I spoke French, he said to me, "Well you know we're looking for people to work in the Congo, would you--may I tell the President that you are interested in working there?"  I thought about that for a while and talked it over with my parents and the next morning my mother, my father [George Reed] and I were at the Blair House meeting Patrice Lumumba.  He, he introduced-- he met my parents and myself.  He greeted us.  He said, "I understand that you're interested in working the Congo, we need people.  I look forward to having you come there and I'll see you,"--what did he say?  I, I think he said I'll see you on the plane.  Now this was on a Saturday and the plane was leaving on Tuesday.  But he, he turned around and said, "Help her get the papers that she needs, c'est ca," this is it and he walked away.  But that--the way that he said --something about the way that he said "c'est ca," this is --we've done that, this is over.  We finished that, that's decided, made my mother believe that it was decided and that I would be going to the Congo, and she was right about that.  I didn't go right away.  Lumumba had been killed by the time I was able to go, but the decision had been made and he was killed in February.  I was there in March of the following year--of the same year that he died.
Story_ID: 168529
Speaker 1: Now how did you, how did you feel following the--that drama in the news?
Speaker 2: It was horrible.  It was, it was horrible.  There were many times when I would--well first of all I became aware of the process of demonization whereby very often the people that we--when I say we, that America --it doesn't like or is afraid that their, that their policies would not be helpful to the United States, or are somehow demonized so that you justify whatever happens to them this way.  And the demon, that demonization process was hard for me because I had met the man [Patrice Lumumba] and I knew that this was not the person that he was.  I had read his book, the--I think the book is called--it's called in French, 'Le Congo, terre d'avenir, est-il menace?,' 'Is the Congo at Risk,' is the rough translation of that-the Congo at risk.  And I had read that book.  And what realized in reading the book was that here is a man whose sole goal is to, is to create liberty and justice for the people of the Congo, for the average citizen, which meant economic justice as well.  So he was trying to figure out ways to expand the economy and to include the poorest of the land in the economic development of the country.  That was the only thing that I could see in his, in his book and in his policies and as his fervent desire, and to see him being demonized by the press and by the State Department and our government was hard for me.  Getting there, being in the middle of an obvious civil war was of course--I guess I was too naive to be, to have thought of it that way initially.
Speaker 1: But--
Story_ID: 168530
Speaker 1: You know there's so much--a lot of the, lot of conflict was on the news and then you know when [Patrice] Lumumba himself was actually killed I mean were-- weren't you afraid to go?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Was I afraid to go?  In the--we know about that now and it may have been in the news somewhere, but it was not in the news here in America.  Well some of it was in the news, but what was in the news here in America was more that he was under house arrest; that, that there was discord or differences of opinion between him and Kasa-Vubu [Joseph Kasa-Vubu].  But there wasn't the sense of, how can I put this, there, there was a--I think there was a minimization of the, of the violence that surrounded his death.  When I saw the movie by Raoul Peck, there were things there that I learned for the first time.  The--of course it had been by then reported that he had been--that his body had been chopped up and, and the brutality and barbarism of the way that he died, came out much later.  For many, many, many weeks we didn't even know that he had been killed.  He was killed I believe on the sixteen of January.  But it was at least a month later before we knew he'd actually died, that he had actually been killed.  So the details of that death were, were scarce.  There were times when, when I did get there.  So when I got there, I was there still working for the Congo government and one of the things that made it possible for me to go there, I had had a visit one day from a man named --he called himself Jose Shelbair [ph.], but who was--that was a pseudonym for the head of the Angola Liberation Front.  And he had come--he, he was in Congo by then and he had come with Kasa-Vubu to America.  And he came by my house and he said, "The President and Mr. Lumumba have no disagreement on your, on your being hired.  They have disagreements on other things, but not on your being hired.  And he wants you to know that he will, he will be inviting you as soon as the circumstances are such that he can guarantee your safety.  But right now, we can't guarantee your safety."  So that was the, I guess the, the level of, of--that was kind of a de-stressor for me, okay.  I'm going to go, this is a political thing, it's politics.  It has nothing to do with me.  It's not--and I didn't, I didn't feel the violence of it.  I felt the violence of what I would call neo-colonialism much more so than internal violence within the country.  I felt the violence of people vying over the resources of a country that was very, very wealthy in diamonds and in uranium and in many other --I think copper and nickel are also the--copper and nick--nickel.  The copper mines under Union Miniere [Union Miniere de Haut-Katanga, Belgian Mining Company], I felt the violence of that kind of thing.  I felt the violence of the, of the separation between the Congo and Katanga Province and the, and the threat of, of secession there.  So when Lumumba was finally captured, my suspicion was that he had been captured by the forces of, of the--Moise Tshombe who was then the, the head of government in Katanga Province, which was secession, which was seceding or trying to secede from the union.  Katanga you have to remember was over 1,000 miles from the capital of the Congo, from Kinshasa and so again, there was tension between those two areas, and there was even tension between the Congo and the diamond producing area, between the capital and the diamond producing area.  But that was not nearly so immediate as some other things.  Now there was some, there were tensions in the capital itself.
Story_ID: 168531
Speaker 1: The tensions between the army and the police force for example, was of much greater concern to me because that was where my life felt threatened.  I remember a couple of occasions on which the police would stop me and each time the, the offense was that bright lights were on.  Once I was in a taxicab, once I was driving my own car.  But the offense was that the bright lights were on, the regular driving lights were on while we were traveling on a major thoroughfare which had overhead lights.  And on those streets the law required that you have only parking lights on and that you, you dimmed the parking lights, so you didn't have lights on.  So my offense was that I was driving down a lit street with lights on.  And I got stopped by a truckload of police officers on both occasions.  On one occasion since I was not--since it was the cab driver, there was an apology to the occupants of the vehicle and we were, we were graciously let out.  We graciously decided we would get out and walk the rest of the way home because the cab driver was so frightened by the encounter that he started off again and forgot to turn the lights off before he started out and they stopped him again.  On the occasion when I was by myself, it was a much harder decision.  I was trying to decide--because by that time, one of the, one of the dangers in the capital was that there was a group of bandits who were in jail by day and being let out by a European resident of the town and given guns and, and uniforms to pretend to be police and terrorize citizens and rob them.  And I had heard some stories of someone who'd actually encountered that group.  So when I was stopped the second time, I'm, I'm, in the process of deciding are these really police.  They have guns.  Do I stop or do I try to outrun them?  And I decided I'd better stop.  So I--obviously it worked out I lived to tell the tale.  But it was a very frightening moment.  It was a very frightening moment.
Story_ID: 168532
Speaker 1: In part because I worked for the Congo government, I felt less, less threatened because I knew a lot of people there; they knew who I was.  And I felt, I felt protected in some ways by, by my links with the people who were in power there.
Speaker 2: Now you, you didn't find out about the death of [Patrice] Lumumba until after you arrived?
Speaker 1: No, I, I think I found out about his death shortly before I, I decided to leave for Africa.  But as I said, there was a period of a month there where we did not know what had happened to him, or how it had happened.  And when I, when I did go, I don't think it was clear how he had died.  In fact it was not clear how he died.  It was sus--it was not even clear who had killed him, but it was believed or assumed that the, the government at Leopoldville [later, Kinasha] did not have anything to do with that except for the tragic error of having suggested that he be moved to Katanga, that he be sent to Katanga to be in prison.  So there was not as much -Kasa-Vubu [Joseph Kasa-Vubu]'s government was not given a lot of blame.  He was--it was felt that he did that to help things be neutralized and calmed in that area, and it did have that effect.  So by the time I got there, things were much calmer than they had been.  Eventually, around the time that I leave, that I was leaving, there was talk of bringing [Moise] Tshombe back to the serve as Prime Minister in the government.  And that I found strange, that I found very strange.  The shifting loyalties was something I could never quite understand or get used to.  But in the minds of many Congolese, Tshombe was a person who had never --he had been--he had stood up to the west, he had stood up to the European powers.  He had stood up to Belgium and never backed down.  And he had been relatively successful with it as it appeared to, to the Congolese at that time.
Story_ID: 168533
Speaker 1: While I was in the Congo, Dag Hammarskjold was assassinated.  He, he was shot down while flying into Katanga [Province].  The story is I came from work, I used--every day at lunch I would come home and get lunch.  And during the lunch break, news would be aired first by the Brazzaville station across the river, and then by Radio Leopoldville or Radio Kinshasa, depending on your political orientation.  So one day the announcement came on Radio Brazzaville that Dag Hammarskjold's plane had been shot down and he had been killed.  Within the hour, the, the UN [United Nations] forces had been contacted and they, they had said on the broadcast that came through Radio Leopoldville, they made the statement that they were still in radio contact at that hour with the airplane and it had not crashed and Hammarskjold was still--and the crew was still alive.  It was not until we heard the 7:00 o'clock news when I came back after going to my afternoon duties and coming back in the evening.  On the 7:00 o'clock broadcast it was confirmed that the plane had been shot down and that Hammarskjold was dead.  But we, we had--I, I never understood why the difference in the two stories.  I think that at that time it was assumed that there was a link between [Moise] Tshombe and the head of government of Brazza--of Congo Brazzaville.  And so it, it--I only can assume that there was some information that was available in Brazzaville that was not available on the other side of the river.  There were a lot of tensions between the two sides, the two Congos for part of the period that I was there.  And I have had nights where I could hear the gunshots across the--being fired across the river between the two forces.
Story_ID: 168534
Speaker 1: This is a, a kind of tenuous situation it seems to me, but you said some good things happened.
Speaker 2: Yes the--there were good things that happened.  I never regretted having gone there.  There were times when I wondered at my naivete thinking that it would be safe to go there and letting my mother [Beatrice Reed]--trying to convince my mother that I'd be okay.  That there were no more dangers there than there were going across the street in the District of Columbia where we can get killed by a passing car; anything can happen.  If it's your time, it's your time.  And so from that point of view, I wasn't too concerned.  But on the positive side, I worked for the high commission for the Inga Dam Project and I was one of the key employees there.
Speaker 1: Now what, what's the name of that dam again?
Speaker 2: Inga, I-N-G-A.  I didn't know very much about dam construction at the time, but I learned a lot in the process, or, or about electricity even.  I learned a lot I the process.  I helped to conduct the--I would get the results of the studies, they had depth studies to test, test the depths of the water that had been--these studies had been going on for years prior to the independence of the Congo.  And we continued those studies.  We maintained radio contact with the site, with the dam site at Inga, which was at the point on the Congo River where the rapids began and where--there was a, a place of rapids between the ocean outlet and I think Matadi [Democratic Republic of the Congo] is the area.  So on the lower part of the Congo River just before it reached the ocean.  These rapids occur that made a, an excellent site for a dam because the, the fall, the steep fall in the river provided energy through the water.  And so they were trying to figure out how, how to harness that energy for electricity.  And I felt a part of something that was going on there.  I felt a part of something special.  I knew, as I said, I knew people in the Congo government at every level of the government.  I met Mobutu [Mobutu Sese Seko] on one occasion during that period, on at least one occasion during that period.  Actually more than one.  And I knew others who were in the government, active in the government as, as ministers.
Story_ID: 168535
Speaker 1: What was Mobutu [Mobutu Sese Seko] like as far as--well I know his--
Speaker 2: In those days, in those days I found him to be a very unassuming person.  He was a military person, but he seemed determined to maintain himself as military only and not to get involved in the running of the government.  That separation between government and army was something that was not easy to come by as you can see from the subsequent history of Africa, independent Africa, with its history of military coup.  But he was trying to avoid that for the Congo.  And I appreciated him for that.  The other thing I very much appreciated about him was that every time I--he often ate at a restaurant where I ate very close to where I lived.  It was called the Zoo Restaurant because it was on the grounds of the local zoo, and--zoological park.  And whenever he was there, he would be there with his wife [Marie-Antoinette Mobutu].  They would be holding hands.  They were often together and I appreciated the--I appreciated the, the values that that seemed to represent, or that, that that implied in, in terms of who he was.  This other side of him seemed to come later after his wife had died and long after I had left the Congo.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now some, I know that some writers even say Zaire implied that he was, you know really putting people (unclear).
Speaker 2: I think that there was--I think there were two different personalities.  There was an article in the Washington Post on the occasion of his death by Russel Howe and Howe said the same thing.  He had been there as a reporter and correspondent with the Washington Post at the same time that I was there, in the 19--early 1960's.  And he found--he--his article indicates that he found Mobutu to be a very different type of personality during that time than he later turned out to be as a dictator and leader of the Congo.
Story_ID: 168536
Speaker 1: How long did you stay in the Congo?
Speaker 2: I was there for two years, from 1961 to 1963.
Speaker 1: All right, you were there straight through, you didn't come back until--
Speaker 2: I, I took--I came home once for a few days R and R [rest and relaxation].  I also went to Uganda.  Uganda became independent during that time and I went to Uganda for their independence.  I had had a schoolmate who was from Uganda.  And so I tried to--I arranged to go.  I thought I had my hotel reservations and everything, but as it turned out, things were not that well organized and so I got a plane ticket but when I got off the plane, the hotel reservations had been given to someone else.  I was very lucky.  I ran into someone at the airport who was an American working as a teacher in one of the special programs there.  And she introduced me to someone who later became a friend.  And she said, "You can stay where I'm staying."  And, and that was how I worked--that's how I ended up not being homeless on the streets of Uganda at independence.  But through that friend I also got to see the independence celebration there.
Story_ID: 168537
Speaker 1: So now after 1960--when you came back in '62 [1962, sic, 1963], what, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  What did I do when I came back?  When I first came back in '62 [1962], I worked for a time at the United States State Department.  I eventually got a job working at--I applied for--I was applying for work and of course that was hard 'cause people don't understand who you are when you tell them that you were secretary of the Inga Dam Project, the highest level civil servant in the government.  The highest job that can be held by a non-citizen in the government of the Congo.  And I may have been the first American employed there, equivalent of an executive director.  But the--that, that term in French is, "secretaire."  It's like Secretary of State.  It's, it's the term secretary, but you know the difference.  Here we didn't know the difference, and so I got referred to people's secretarial pool and it took a while before I got on track.  But eventually I became a, a--I got, I got referred to the United States State Department and I worked in the--as a foreign affairs officer in the United States Department of State.  I did that for a couple of years in, in that capacity.  A lot of firsts for me.  I was the first African American and the second woman to serve as secretary of a major delegation of the United States to an international conference.  I worked as a foreign affairs officer in the Office of International Conferences, and I was assigned to head administrative services as a member of the delegation appointed by [President] Lyndon B. Johnson for the fourteenth General Assembly of UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]; a first, a first.
Story_ID: 168538
Speaker 1: I enjoyed my time in Paris [France].  It was an excit--it was a large delegation, it was an exciting time.  There was a subway strike while I was there and I had a lot of juggling to do to manage the budget that we had for the conference, but I, I did it.  I did it.
Speaker 2: Was this your first trip to Paris?
Speaker 1: I believe it was, yes it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay now--
Speaker 1: I went--I remember going to the Louvre and taking in all of the sites in downtown Paris in those days too.  It was winter and one of the things I remember is how short the day was.  It would be dark when I got out to work at eight o'clock in the morning on the way to work, and would begin to get lighter.  And it would be--by the time I got home if it was after four o'clock, I'd be going home in the dark as well.
Story_ID: 168539
Speaker 1: You have become somewhat of an expert on the Negritude Movement.  Can, can you tell us about that?  At this time had you, had you begun to, to--
Speaker 2: When I came back from Africa, I began to, to be interested in what I had experienced and understanding what I had experienced in a different way.  I wanted to understand African culture.  I wanted to understand values.  I wanted to understand the, the ontology or the, the way of looking at life that seemed to be very different from the way we look at life here and yet it, it resonated for me in many ways and at many levels.  The sense of community.  The sense of, of economic wellbeing as something that everyone had a right to.  The sense of, of communicating by dialogue and resolving problems through dialogue.  All those things resonated with me and I wanted to understand the experience I'd had better.  So I began to read about Africa and to read about books like [John] Beattie's book on African religions and philosophies which helped me to understand value systems.  But I had not done that when I--I had not learned about Neg--the Negritude Movement when I first came back.  I certainly hadn't done it when I went.  That's what--that trip to Africa inspired my, my expansion, the expansion of my reading.  And I went--I decided--I went to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] to teach around that time and decided to enter the Union graduate program, which would allow me to begin to study a field that was--that there wasn't much documentation of, wasn't--there wasn't any formal program then.
Speaker 1: Now we're talking about 19--
Speaker 2: We're talking about 1968 approximately.
Speaker 1: So you get to Wilberforce, okay.  Well I don't wanna get you there yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I know you went to the festival of the African arts and culture [World Festival of Black Arts].
Speaker 2: Yes, in 1966.
Speaker 1: Dakar [Senegal] in '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think that was a, a more important introduction to African culture, and also to Negritude and to--you're right.  It was an introduction to Negritude and to African--Pan Africanism.  The Pan Africanist Movement because the, the festival was in 19--held in 1966 at Dakar.  It was the first such attempt to bring people involved in the arts and sci---and letters from all over the world into Africa so that they could compare notes and so what happened by attending that festival, I wanted my--I, I went because I wanted my mother [Beatrice Reed] to experience Africa with me.  And so we went together to the festival.  We went on a chartered plane that had, that had been sponsored by what was called the American Society on-the American Society on African Culture, which was known in those days for encouraging interaction between African Americans and Africans in a variety of ways.  And they helped to sponsor the American participation in that conference.  So I went on their plane and it was an exciting trip.  Haile Selassie was there.  I was introduced to Aime Cesaire's work through a presentation of the play, "Roi Christophe," [sic, La Tragedie du roi Christophe]--King Christopher and the story of Haiti.  I saw the West Indian dances one night and my mother was from the West Indies so I--to see these cultures intertwine and interconnect in this way was, was exciting and it got me started.  I think that's really what got me started in trying to see Africa another way and to see it from the cultural point of view and understanding the culture as a, a strong point in terms of what I was trying to do.

Speaker 1: Okay now also on this trip [to the 1966 World Festival of Black Arts], I think the Fisk Jubilee Singers, you got Langston Hughes was there and--
Speaker 2: The Alvin Ailey Dancers were there.  I don't remember seeing the Fisk Jubilee Singers at the time that I was there, but Alvin, Alvin Ailey.  I went to the pres--the poetic presentation of Langston Hughes and in fact have a funny story about that.  I ran into Hughes outside of the president's palace and he had on this--he had cameras on all over him and he was a very unassuming person.  So I'm, I'm looking at, at the gate of the--at the door of the palace and I'm just sightseeing too and I said, "Oh an American sightseer."  And I went over and I introduced myself.  And he said "Hi, my name is Hughes."  And he said "I'm just waiting here for the president to get this luncheon started that he's giving in my honor."  And I suddenly realized it was that Mr. Hughes.  So that was my first, my introduction to Langston Hughes.  I think it was a day or two later that he gave his presentation of poetry.  One of the poems that he, that he had recited.  "He said I'm gonna do one poem by somebody else."  He did a [HM] Julian Bond poem.  And the poem by Julian Bond was just very short.  He said, he said all he--he said all poetry can't be dull, some of it's fun.  He said here's, here's this poem by Julian Bond.  "Look at that girl shake that thing.  Everybody can't be Martin Luther King."  So he--I remember him reciting that poem, but I also remember I got some of his books on that occasion and I got an autographed copy of one of them.  But the thing I remember was translations of his works into French and also the fact that he had translated the works of people like Senghor [Leopold Sedar Senghor] and others in the French speaking--French expression into English so that these works then became available.  And it was that background of having read Hughes's work, Hughes's translation of the Negritude writers, when I, when I finally got into the doctoral program at the, at the Union Institute through Antioch College [Yellow Springs, Ohio], Leon Damas was one of the people that I worked with and he was one of the fathers of Negritude.  And so through Damas and through this experience of, of meeting Langston Hughes and, and beginning to read those works in English, I became interested in Negritude.  So when I got to Wilberforce and to later at Wright State University, I introduced a course called the Negritude.  I'm sorry, I introduced a course on the Negritude writers in translation as part of the French Department.
Speaker 1: I think it's called the, 'Negritude Process.'
Speaker 2: 'The Negritude Process,' was the name of the article I wrote in Jet Magazine, yes.  Not Jet, the Negro Digest when--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was Black World then by the--
Speaker 2: Yes, when Hoyt Fuller was alive, Black World.
Speaker 1: And that was published in 60--'76 [1976], '75 [1975], '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: I think it was January of '75 [1975].
Story_ID: 168541
Speaker 1: Now before we leave Senegal, can you tell us about this pageant on the island of Goree?  Just had an image a couple of days of President [George H.W.] Bush standing in the doorway of the castle.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But what--there was--you saw this pageant there and it dramatized the connection between the African and the rest of the diaspora.
Speaker 2: That was an important--yes, that was an important part for me of the, of the first festival.  We went to the island of Goree for a festival in light and sound and I don't think anything had been done like that before nor since.  Now in France, there's this background of, of the castles of France are often--their history is often told in these festivals of light and sound.  And the idea had come from that background.  President Senghor [Leopold Sedar Senghor] had decided to do something similar on the island of Goree.  So he tells the story of Goree and there were bleachers on one part of the beach and the, the cameras pan and the lights were set in such a way that you could from--as the story was told, you could see the European section of the island with its mansion, the governor's mansion.  You could see the prison, it was then being used as a prison, but it was a--at that--initially it had been a holding ground for the slaves while they were waiting for the boats to come in, and then they would pan over to the ocean itself and, and the rowboats and show the small boats that would take slaves out to the larger boats and put them, and pack them on.  Now I did not see the actual, "Door of No Return," until a subsequent visit to Senegal for, for field study.  When I--that was in '72 [1972].   And the, "Door of No Return," you can see that the boats could actually come up to the edge of the, to the edge of the building.  And so from that proximity, the, the "Door of No Return" is at a dis--at a height of some feet, you know off the ground.  And you just walk straight into the hold of the boat from the, from the window of the, "Door of No Return."  And there are some little smaller cells there, smaller than the large prison where many were held as they waited for the boats.  The large prison was a place where people were being brought from all parts of that Senegambia area and held, but then they would be put on one boat or another.  The boats would come through more gradually and they'd be put on one boat or another over a period of time.  So the smaller cells were like holding cells for someone to go on a specific boat that would be coming up to that window.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a horrible feeling to, to stand on that second trip I went, I went into the fort, what had been the fort where they, where they paroled or patrolled the waters off the coast of, of Senegal, whichever power happened to be controlling the island at the time.  And I remember going into the fort and at one point it was very dark and you know it had, it had been in disrepair.  And I finally got to the port where the window was and where they would, where they would keep the, the, the arms that--the canons that would patrol the waters; that would protect the waters.  And when I got there and just saw that ocean, I just had tears in my eyes because I knew that I had a grand--a great grandparent from French West Africa that had probably gone through that port.  And I came out of there just feeling so bad and went to the Catholic church and, and went up to the altar rail and as I tried to kneel at the altar rail, all of a sudden I remembered as I looked up I saw the gold around the church and I recognized the role and complicity of the church in the slave trade and in its, and in the Middle Passage, and the inhumanity of the Middle Passage.  And I couldn't kneel there.  I, I ran out of the church crying.  But that same trip I had a healing experience.  There's a museum a few doors down and so the person who had guided--little kid who was guiding me around the island took me to the museum.  And there I saw things that reminded me of the connection again.  And it helped; it was a very important part of healing for me.
Speaker 1: What sort of things were there that reminded you of the connection?
Speaker 2: I saw bead, beadwork from South Africa that was very much like Native American beadwork.  And then I saw another set of beads that had come out of South Africa, or that they were, they were made from seeds.  And I had seen a, a necklace almost exactly like that, beadwork almost exactly like that.  The same seeds.  A student at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] had learned that craft visiting family in the South.  And so it was very clear to me that we brought a lot to--from Africa to the United States and we kept some of it even though we don't remember all that we kept.
Story_ID: 168542
Speaker 1: Now this is a time in our history of--African re-awakening.  Shortly, I think around the same time some of the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] volunteers took a, a hiatus and took a trip to Africa, Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] and Fannie Lou Hamer even went, Stokely Carmichael.  People were going--were now starting to focus on not just the American south of the Civil Rights Movement, but to focus on connection with Africa.  And so heretofore just for anybody watching this tape, I mean heretofore this kind of intense kind of series of visits, you know, were not going on.
Speaker 2: That, that is true.  I--my mother [Beatrice Reed] says she was fifty years ahead of her time and in some ways I was too, fifty years ahead of my time because I went to Africa because it was common to go to Africa.  I felt the need to go to Africa.  The need to understand what Africa represented.  I remember my grandmother saying as I grew up, "I am black, B-L-A-C-K." and she often talked about being an African person.  So she was very much aware of that connection.  And I think the West Indian branch, that West Indian branch of the family was much more not only cognizant of it, but mindful of the need to, to pass it on to future generations.  On the American side, I don't think we had the basis; my father [George Reed] didn't know who his mother was.  Didn't know who his father was.  Had no information, had not grown up with his siblings.  And so I think that that--you know his story is pretty typical of a loss of connection, a loss of sense of history and place in history that came along with the, the culture of slavery.  But so, so I was ahead of my time in terms of feeling this, this absolute imperative to go to Africa to see for myself the land of my ancestors.  To understand what this "jungle," was all about.  To understand what, what--especially the heart of Africa when Zaire [later, Democratic Republic of the Congo] was about, it was an exciting prospect for me to start out my, my journey, my search by going straight to the heart of Africa.  Was an incredibly exciting journey for me.  And then the next stop being Senegal.  By the time I got to Senegal in 1972, I was, I was aware through my grandmother's stories of a connection to the Senegambia.  But what happened when I actually got there, was that this connection came alive for me through things like a woman who spoke to me in Serer and I understood her in English to have said I recognize you, and you are one, and you are one of us.  And this was confirmed by someone translating her li--Serer in to the French.  So I had heard her right.  And there were other very spiritual experiences of connectedness where things came alive for me that suggested certain kinds of links to Africa, to the African continent.  For example, I was looking at a mask one day and the mask came alive for me and I could feel--it was as though I were in danger of being possessed by the mask as I looked at it.  And so I couldn't look at it.  The mask was being held in the museum at, at Dakar at Senegal, in Senegal.  And I couldn't look at it.  I couldn't study it because--but I tried to see the tag on it to see where it was from and I discovered it was from northern Ivory Coast and that the people of that area had moved from northern Ivory Coast through Nigeria into Senegal.  And so I said I wonder if that is the part of this West African connection that there is in my life.  I still don't know the answer.  But we have many--much more access to information now that can give us clues than we had at that time.  No one was doing the research.  And so I'm excited to have been part of that thrust to get African studies, African culture into the curriculum as part of African American studies.
Story_ID: 168543
Speaker 1: It certainly was an exciting experience.  It was incredible in terms of meeting the people who were on the front of the black arts, the African American arts artistic movement in the United States and that people like Sam Allen, the president--pardon?
Speaker 2: He's the poet.
Speaker 1: He's a poet who wrote--
Speaker 2: Wrote under the name of Paul--
Speaker 1: He wrote under the Name of Paul Vesey.  And he wrote a book called 'Ivory Tusks [Ivory Tusks and Other Poems]' in the negritude style of writing, although he, he was in fact he may have been the only English writer, writer in, in English language of negritude poetry.  Who else did I meet at that?  I ran--I met [HM] Maya Angelou, I ran into her as well in Dakar [Senegal] on that, at that trip.  Martin Jenkins, the president of--at that time the president of the school in Baltimore [Maryland], Morgan State University, was also there.  And as I, as I said, both Aime Cesaire and Haile Selassie came through during, during the time that I was in Dakar.  Duke Ellington was there and [HM] Mercer Cook was--Duke Ellington came to the, to the congress, and Mercer Cook was there.  Our ambassador to Mercer Cook had been the head of romance languages at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] for many, many years.  And he was the United States ambassador to Senegal.  He had invited Cook on one occasion to--I'm sorry--he had invited Duke Ellington on one--and his band to play for an evening for the American participants in the, in the festival, press who were--the Americans present at the festival and I was one of the persons invited to that event.  I enjoyed that immensely and I will never forget the evening with Duke Ellington and his music and the, the--as you say the luminaries from African American life who were there.  There were people there, there were artists there who, who exhibited at the convention.
Story_ID: 168544
Speaker 1: Can you tell us, you know, what was the scope of the conference in terms of the other participants from all over the black world.  Were there, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Countries where they had large black populations, like, like Brazil.
Speaker 2: Well the interesting thing about it was it wasn't just count--countries with large populations, but it was the first attempt to bring people together from all over the world who had African--who were of African origin.  And to, to compare notes about the cultures there.  Brazil, I don't remember who--the extent to which Brazil and other countries were represented, although I'm sure they were, they were.  South America was represented because I imagine that [Leon] Damas was there.  I, and I do know that the West Indian Islands were represented as well.  Europe was represented.  I remember meeting--I think the importance was that for the first time we, we got this sense that there were people all over the world who were related to Africa.  And because they were related to Africa, were related to each other or to one another.  And so the, so that the conference had a meaning in terms of Pan Africanism as well, and the Pan African movement.
Speaker 1: 'Cause previously people met basically around political affinity rather than cultural affinity.  Is that correct?  Would you agree with that?  The (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes I would say that the first Pan African Movement was a political movement and because it was a political movement of colonial peoples, it took place in colonial lands.  It, it--the meetings of the Pan African conferences were in--until Six PAC [the sixth Pan African Congress], they were all in England or France or--England or France were the, the locus of those conf--until the, the sixth Pan African Conference which was in Tanzania, the first one on African soil.
Speaker 1: So this conference in '66 [1966] was like a big homecoming--
Speaker 2: A kind, yes, and I think it was in part because of what you described as that movement of people who were part of the Civil Rights Movement and part of the movement for an end to oppression and justice in other parts of the world.  They also wanted--they were feeling this need to see Africa, to see the land of their origins and to understand what there was about Africa, what there was of truth and lies in this--and the stereotypes about African people wherever they happened to be in the world.  I know for me it was a case of let me see for myself.  But seeing for myself, there was a, an immediate understanding that I had no sense of context in terms of the cultural reality.  And so from that point of view, Senghor's [Leopold Sedar Senghor] hosting this, this cultural conference was tremendously important.
Story_ID: 168545
Speaker 1: I think he [Leopold Sedar Senghor] may have recognized it from the fact that, that there were people from all parts of the African world who gathered in Paris [France] during the time that he was a student there.  And so [Leon] Damas was a student there, Aime Cesaire was a student there at the same time that Senghor was a student there.  Together they started the Negritude Movement.  Each of them adding to the movement in a different way; adding to Negritude in a different way.  And--
Speaker 2: Didn't they form the, the magazine, what was it, journal Presence Africaine.
Speaker 1: Presence Africaine came later.  There was a, an initial magazine.  I think it was called The Black Student where students from various parts of the African world got together and that was where the, the doctrines of negritude were announced initially.  But then in the 1940s Presence Africaine came on the scene.  Yes, that went a long way toward bringing the artistic presence together.  They had a volume called, 'Africa as Seen by the American Negro [sic, Africa Seen by the American Negro, 1958],' in which Leo Hansberry [William Leo Hansberry] wrote an article.  And another, another volume around the time of the festival itself, 'The Sound of the New Negro Poetry [sic, New Sum of Poetry from the Negro World, 1966],' which put in poems from all parts of the African world, including Brazil and the Caribbean, other parts of South America, North American poets, poets of French expression, poets of Spanish expression, poets of Portuguese expression, African poets.  It was an amazing compilation of, of African poetry, yes.
Story_ID: 168546
Speaker 1: Now there was also sort of a discouraging article written by E. Franklin Frazier.  I mean in the '50s [1950s], what can the negro do for africa, [sic, 'What Can the American Negro Contribute to the Social Development of Africa?'] or something like that, published by Presence Africaine.  Kind of little discouraging treat us on what, you know, the incapacity of black people to handle their own affairs, let alone those in Africa.
Speaker 2: That's the kind of thing that could under normal circumstances, could and should have kept me away from Africa.  There was a sense of people coming to Africa without being able to contribute to Africa, and I ran into one or two of them during my own stay in Africa.  What can the negro contribute.  When I went [Patrice] Lumumba convinced me that, had convinced me before his death, that there was something for me to do; that there was a need for the, the skills that I had coming from America, an industrialized country and having that background of education, that I could bring to support the, the quest for independence, or the movement toward independence in a fledgling country.  I felt that my background in political science would be important because government and political science was going to be an area of challenge for the new government, for the new country.  My, my job was apolitical in a sense, being with the dam project and the dam was parastatal, but that was in part a way of protecting me that, that I wouldn't be on the front lines of whatever that battle was by being employed in something neutral and technical like a dam project.  But that did require me to do some new learning.  What was your question again?
Speaker 1: No, I was just commenting on the discouraging, I mean those books, you know, discouragement like E. Franklin Frazier's being the, I guess the main--actually pub--published in Presence Africaine (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I think part of the motive for that, for publishing it in Presence Africaine was to remind African Americans that we needed to take ourselves seriously and take our studies seriously and understand what it was that we could bring to Africa.  Many African Americans or Africans from the Diaspora have gone back to Africa and contributed in various ways to--some of them have just set--settled and, and live there in the same way that they would settle and live anywhere else, but their contributions and their contributions have been consistent with, with the culture of the countries.  Not they--they haven't been working in, in government or, or doing the kinds of things--or working for dam projects or things of that sort.  But they've been living as every day citizens and that too has a value.  That has an important value.  I think the danger is in African Americans coming back like many of us did to Liberia and Sierra Leone initially coming and taking over those places as places that then belong to us or we recreate America.  And I think that the, the challenge there is that we create America on top of African cultures of long standing that have been damaged by the slave trade, and we don't really, when I say we, that the returning Africans didn't really get involved in trying to integrate those people into, into what they had, or in trying to change those societies so that they could have something that was really common--more common ground.  So we have some of the problems that we have today in Liberia and in Sierra Leone particularly based on that fact.  You really have, you really have two different kinds of Africans there.  Africans from Diaspora and indigenous Africans, and not much to really help them to, to meld or to come together as a unit.  Franklin Frazier said something else.  He also felt that African Americans had lost--they had no--that they didn't bring anything that represented Africa over here with them; that they didn't retain much of Africa in the present day.  My research has helped me to discover that that was certainly not the case.  That there was much more retained than Franklin could have imagined.  Sorry he didn't live to see some of the research that has come forward now.
Story_ID: 168547
Speaker 1: Well tell me about Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Now how did you wind up at Wilberforce University in Ohio, living in Washington D.C.
Speaker 2: Well I married in 1966, right after the first festival.  I got married that fall.  And one of the things that my husband and I decided to do was to--he, he wanted to experience the Midwest.  He had friends who had worked at, at Wilberforce and lived there.  And they really encouraged us to come and felt that my background might provide me an opportunity to teach there.  That's what happened.  I went out there and I got a job almost right away as part of the administrative staff in the Department of--in student services area.  I--but it was part teaching and part student services.  I worked as the coordinator of the--of student life programs.  That was--they had a, a required course that was like chapel.  It was like--with speakers from the--African American speakers.  And I had to coordinate that.  I brought in the speakers, saw that they got paid and, and managed the calendar.  And then I also insisted that the students do feedback on what they had experienced.  So they had to write at last three papers giving feedback on the programs that had occurred during their--during the semester, and they got a grade.  So I was responsible for seeing to it that they got a grade.  I had 500 students a semester.  Yeah it was a little bit of a challenge there.  We, we did some--we had computerized attendance sheets so that's how I could verify attendance.  And the papers, well you get a paper, you, you know you have a paper, so that, that was another verification.
Story_ID: 168548
Speaker 1: Okay now, now Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] is an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] college in Ohio, southwestern Ohio.
Speaker 2: Yes it is.
Speaker 1: Oldest, supposedly the oldest black--there's a dispute between Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri] and Wilberforce as which one is the oldest, but--
Speaker 2: Well the dispute is based on the fact Wilberforce clams to be the oldest college founded by blacks for blacks.  And from that point of view, they have--they've won their case.  Other schools were founded by others for blacks; not, not by African Americans themselves.  So the A.M.E. church built that church, built the school on pennies and dimes of, and contributions of church members all over the, all over the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now (unclear) you went to Charles Young Grade School, but Will--Wilberforce was the home of Charles Young.
Speaker 2: Yes it was.  Interestingly enough, his daughter still lived there when I arrived.  She died during the time I--during my first year there and I took over her classes.  She taught French there, and I took over her French classes and was the French teacher at Wilberforce.  That's how I started teaching French in fact. I hadn't come--and that's--in fact, that was my first experience teaching at the college level.  That's how I got into college teaching.
Story_ID: 168549
Speaker 1: Once I had that experience of interacting with students, I was excited that the possibilities for teaching other kinds of courses and bringing the African American experience into the curriculum in a major way.  That was one of the things that was an agenda item for people who--for the students in most--in many schools at the time.  There was--relevant education was the issue on the table.  And, and for African Americans, relevant education meant including them in the curriculum in a major way, in a new way.  So I was involved in that, that my colleagues on the staff said, "Well you've just come from Africa, help us to, to deal with this, help us to confront this.  Let's do a workshop."  And so several of us got together and did a workshop on starting a--what we decided to call a black education program.  And then students got--students were involved; it was a faculty-student committee eventually when, when, when we had strikes and turmoil on the campus at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]--you know Wilberforce was I believe the first campus to invite the National Guard in to help deal with student unrest.
Speaker 2: Now did that happen while, while you were there?
Speaker 1: That happened while I was there, and it was before Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio].
Speaker 2: And what, what was the issue there on campus?
Speaker 1: Students wanted relevant education.  They wanted more say and more control in, in the courses, in the curriculum, in curriculum choices.  There were other issues that may have had to do with meals and cafeteria and that kind of thing, ambulance services, services available on campus to the students.  I don't really remember all of the issues at this time, but I, I know that, the serious of it was that students decided not to go to classes or to susp--or to strike, to go on strike.
Speaker 2: Were you caught in a--as director of student life programs, were you, was, was--
Speaker 1: Yes, I was, I was in the thick of things.  I was in the middle of things.  Very interestingly when the strikes first occurred, I went to the home of the president [Rembert Stokes] right away because I wanted to make a statement that I wanted the president to know that I was supporting him and that this was something that we would have to work through.  He felt committed to the process of dialogue.  As a minister I think and perhaps that's just something that is part of African mindset.  But for whatever reasons, he was committed to the process of dialogue and set up a meeting right away with students.  While we were in one of those early meetings with students, fire engines came on campus and the Galloway Hall was burned down on the campus next door at Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  Now prior to that, there had been a fire set, an arson, arson was involved, in a fire set that burned down the Student Union on, right on, on Wilberforce's campus.  And it was that fire that had led us to the table where we were having this discussion and meeting when the other fire occurred.  It was in the wake of those two fires that the National Guard was called to Wilberforce and to Central State's campus.  We were lucky there were no deaths on our campus.  There were some incidents where people were bruised or harmed, or injured in some way because of curfew violations primarily.  But no one was killed or, or hurt.  It wasn't until--by the way, the war [Vietnam War] was not an issue for, for the campus at that time.  This was not their main concern in terms of the striking.
Story_ID: 168550
Speaker 1: What, what, what year was this?
Speaker 2: This would have been 19--it would have been 1969 or '70 [1970].  It would have been 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is prior to Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Prior to Kent State.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that would be the spring (unclear)--
Speaker 2: In the fall.
Speaker 1: In the fall.
Speaker 2: In the fall, by the fall of--I think in the spring, the spring was--the spring of 1970.  Well of course the death of [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther] King [Jr.] sparked some of this unrest.  That was the beginning of the unrest, so it started in the spring of 1968.  By the fall of 1969, we were in the process of, of trying to begin to deal with this, of this unrest.  But it wasn't--the building wasn't--I think the burnings occurred prior--around the spring of 1970.  By the fall of 1970, the school had decided to arbitrate the differences, to go for binding, legal arbitration.  We called in a--we hired a, a skilled arbitrator.  We committed to binding arbitration.  And one of the first things that the arbitrator did was to set up--to decide that we were gonna do three groups.  He found that the faculty and the administration had their issues that were separate from the issues of the students.  And so he set us up into three groups, faculty, administration and students.  When that happened, the president, because I was so new to the campus, the president decided that he would make me the--his alternate, which meant that I would have to be present at all meetings.  He knew that I had the respect of the students, and I knew them all because I taught them all.  He knew also that I had the respect of my colleagues and I think if, if--but because I was new, if, if I had gone as part of the faculty group, I probably would not have been selected to do anything as part of that committee and he wanted me to be on that committee.  So he made me his alternate.  And because of that, I was part of the negotiations, although I did not have a vote.  I was just present for those negotiations.  When the negotiations were ended, he gave me the responsibility of seeing to it that all three parties to the agreement kept the agreement.  And I presented him with a report within the year.  So the negotiations took place in the fall, the agreement was complete, or we had, we had met all terms of the agreement by the spring of 1971.
Story_ID: 168551
Speaker 1: So that takes us right up to--
Speaker 2: Bolinga Center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio].  Now you left Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] actually I guess-
Speaker 2: I left Wilberforce that summer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we, we may be a year ahead cause it--yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so we're talking, we're talking seven, 1970 was the year, the spring of 1970 would have been the year that the agreement was completed.
Speaker 1: Right, right, spring of '70 (1970).  And then, and then you started talking to Wright State about--
Speaker 2: During the summer.  I was really burned out after going through that experience of a black education program.  I was feeling burned out.  And when the opportunity came to work at Wright State, it seemed like an answer to a prayer because it was right in the field of black studies.  I think the Black Student Union had just gotten an agreement from the school to start a black cultural center.  And it worked out perfectly, coincided also with my decision to enter the Union Graduate School program.  And so this made the perfect internship under that, under that program.  It was consistent with my desire to be working in black studies and to be putting that into the curriculum.  And I was very excited about the possibilities.  So I started work there in--I was hired and started work at Wright State in the fall of 1970, so that we opened the center itself in January of '71 (1971), and we've got the chronology now.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now the, the Bolinga Center at Wright University was named for, was the name is one that you, that you suggested was a Lingala--
Speaker 2: It's a Lingala word.  Lingala is the, one of the vehicular languages of central Africa.  And very, a very important language in the Congo [Democratic Republic of the Congo].  It was the language that was spoken in the capital.  And the word Bolinga was taken from Kolinga, to love, the noun Bolingo, love.  And so the, the word that we selected was Bolinga to reflect that love.  Now we also opened on the 15th of January in a very deliberate way honoring Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and this would--remember in 1971 we didn't have a King holiday.  So this was about ten years before the actual holiday had been decided upon.  But we were--we understood that it was going to be important to honor Dr. King in his work and his life.  And for many of us, that was about nonviolence and peace and justice, but all of those terms are subsumed in the word love.

Speaker 1: Now at Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio], the, as the stage is being set for the opening of the Bolinga Center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center] and there's a--another big controversy, which is mostly a white campus in terms of student population.  The black population being very small.  I think the one black administrator was in trouble on, on the campus when you started.
Speaker 2: Are you speaking of Betty Thomas?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, she wasn't--this was very soon after I started, and she wasn't really in trouble.  She applied for a promotion, which seems like a very simple thing to do.  But rather than give her the opportunity to compete in--for that promotion in the same way that everyone else was, the president made the decision that she was not qualified and barred her from the competition.  That was a mistake.  It was a political mistake because of the climate of the campus at the time.  It was a civil rights mistake because this was contrary to what we were calling, what do you call that--it was contrary to the, the kind of equal, equal opportunity thrust that was going on at the time.  And so it ended up being an issue among the black students.  And the students threatened to strike.  They, they did demonstrate and the, the faculty also demonstrated, or became concerned and tried to intervene in a way that would get some clarity and get the, and get the situation back on track.  We were hoping to give Ms. Betty Thomas the opportunity to--just the opportunity to apply and, and fill out her application and be considered; that was all that we felt--that was all that we were concerned about, the fairness of her being considered.  We thought that she was qualified to be considered.  So that was our initial, our initial thrust.  As it turned out, when the, when the students decided to go and, and stand in the lobby of the Administration Building, the president who was meeting with the faculty at the time, black faculty at the time, decided that he was being threatened more than the rest of us were being threatened by the presence of these students.  I told him we were all in the room together and until he let us know that they were there, nobody knew that they were there.  But that did nonetheless end the, the negotiations.  I don't think we ever got back on track.  Not too long after that, Mr. [Brage] Golding accepted the presidency of another university.
Speaker 1: San Diego State [University, San Diego, California] I think it was.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am could you state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yvonne Seon, S-E-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is the 18th of July, and this is 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?  You don't--don't give me the address.
Speaker 2: Okay, we're at my home.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: In Maryland, in the state of Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On the outskirts of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C].
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is a continuation of an interview that we started Monday the--what was Monday.  Well we started it--
Speaker 2: That was started on Monday, the 11th I believe.
Speaker 1: Yes, and we left off at, at you--you were--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Monday was the 13th.
Speaker 1: Right, right, Monday the 13th, 2003.
Story_ID: 168554
Speaker 1: When we left off, we were talking about your changing positions, moving from Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio] to Wright State University [Dayton, Ohio].  And how did that happen?  How did you find out about this job at Wright State University and at the time what did you think of Wright State University?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  Wright State was a new university.  Some of us thought that it was competing with--or competing for some of the same people that were likely to go to Wilberforce or to Central State University [Wilberforce, Ohio] as a state school.  And for that reason, there was some question about it.  I think--I don't know that I shared those questions.  I had not known that much about it.  I was approached by my neighbor, Larry Abrams, who knew of my involvement in, in the student life programs at Wilberforce and also the fact that the course that I was teaching there, Cultural Development I think it was called then, later Cultural Awareness course, was very much concerned with the Af--with African American cultural life.  And so he thought it would be a good match and he knew that the students there were looking for someone to head up a new program that had just been agreed to by the administration as a result of student demands.  And of course what I had been doing at Wilberforce was in direct response to a series of student demands and my working in conjunction with the administration to understand and to create change at the university that was consistent with both the role of the university and the stated demands of the students.  So that was how I found out about the vacancy at Wright State.  And I was just beginning a--just getting ready to begin a doctoral program through the Union Institute [Cincinnati, Ohio].  A nontraditional program.  And I thought that would make an excellent job to have, it would be both a job and it--and a labor of love and an internship under the, the doctoral program that I was in terms of--in back studies--in black studies.  I thought it would provide an excellent opportunity and an excellent marriage for what I was interested in doing.  So it was like the beginning of my life all over again.  And certainly the major jump-off point in my career.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so what happened?  Well what happened next?  You found out about the job, so did you--
Speaker 2: I then applied for it and I was accepted.  The students interviewed me among others, and they were great--I was--I enjoyed meeting them and they seemed to appreciate the skills that I was bringing to this task.  And so I was hired.  I was hired in--to start in September or October of 1970.  I had just started the graduate program at the Union Institute and I was very excited.  The first--one thing that I appreciated about the job at Wright State was that I had a--it was an administrative position.  I also had a faculty rank as I think I was Assistant Professor of French, I taught French over there.  That was part of my responsibility, to teach in the French Department.  So I had a dual appointment.  And I was on the Curriculum Committee.  I was appointed to the Curriculum Committee that first year that I was there.  I thought that was excellent because it gave the opportunity for some input and some discussion about including African American studies in the curriculum, even though the position that I had was administrative.
Story_ID: 168555
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio] prior to your arrival, had been jokingly referred to--it wasn't a joke, actually, by students as, "White State."  And they were very--
Speaker 2: I think there were only about--was it eight or nine students of color at the time that I arrived, or were there more?
Speaker 1: Only eight or nine visible I'll say.
Speaker 2: Eight or nine active.
Speaker 1: Wright State in the 1970 we could typify--I mean our research tells us that there were 50 students on campus, fifty black students on campus.  And many of them were night students.  It was a commuter school.
Speaker 2: It was a commuter school.  And I suspect that the eight students that I refer to were the, the ones who were there in the day time.  The other, I guess, I guess that was out of a total student population of about 6,000 at that time if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: I think it eight, maybe more than the number of students that were involved with the center.  I mean I guess working in, on the staff of the center maybe.  But there were more actually there, you just didn't see them.
Speaker 2: You didn't see them much.  As, as you said there were eight visible students in the day time, which was when I was there mostly.  I'm sure that there were more than that.  But the fifty would have been out of about five or six thousand student body, student population.
Story_ID: 168556
Speaker 1: Now this is something that--well I just wanted to ask you.  At the time, 19--early '70s [1970s], late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], a lot of state colleges and universities around the country and the private ones too, were starting black cultural centers and--but there was a fairly wide range of looks that these cultural centers would take on.  University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio] in the same area, had a cultural center that consisted of a desk and an African mask on the wall.  And a phone.  And that was pretty much it.  There was Cleveland State [Cleveland, Ohio] had a--sort of a museum attached to what their cultural center--there were different kinds of cultural centers and there was a--I think what happened at Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio] was a little bit different from what happened at some of these other places in terms of their content of the cultural.  You, you wanna talk about that?
Speaker 2: I'd be delighted to talk about that because I think it was largely in part of that very small student, African American student population that we had what we did.  But I was aware of fifty students.  There were only eight faculty members as it, as it turns out, little bit of confusion there.  But there were about faculty and staff of color and about fifty students at the time.  But they had, before I came, through getting together, through organizing they had been able to, to get concessions out of the administration that allowed us to have a space in the building adjacent to the library, a very large space.  What we decided to do was to try to make something of that space that would truly be a resource to the campus community, making materials available to the whole student body about the African American condition.  That was our vision.  We had a vision of very serious academic study going on around the, around African American studies, and of being a part of the evolution of the shape that African American studies should, should take and what cultural centers should look like.  Part of what that meant for our student population was that we wanted a link to the community.  That was something the students were insisting on, that there be a strong link to the community.  And that I, I think the other thing that, that was being insisted upon was that black studies be taken seriously, that this was an area for aca--of academic concern.  And so they wanted the center to provide opportunities for people to expand their field of knowledge.  And that was certainly consistent with what I was trying to do as well.  My, my vision of black studies, in fact my doctoral research was on this, this issue of a vision for black studies in the curriculum, what should that look like, what should it consist of, what, what did people need to know.  And as you point out, there was a wide range of discussion on that.  Some people thought it was just a matter of taking the same old curriculum and putting black faces there.  For example in history, bringing in the black faces in history.  And I felt that black studies was more than just expanding our knowledge of history by including the black faces.  Because there was a, there were a lot of different issues involved.  The whole issue of, of cultural retentions was not ever addressed, and that was what I thought the center should, should begin to do, to provide information which would help people to make those links themselves.
Story_ID: 168557
Speaker 1: So the, the construction--I mean the assembling of a cultural--of this cultural center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio] included a number of components.  And maybe you can talk about it.  I know there was a library constituted with and audio visual material.
Speaker 2: The library was perhaps the last thing on the agenda.  The first thing we had to do was order furniture.  I mean we really started from scratch with only the space and a desk as you pointed out.  But then we had to order furniture.  And I remember getting some partitions also to--so that there could be spaces within the center, some privacy.  Spaces for seating areas.  We also had to retrieve these showcases where we could put things that were--we could put things on exhibit for use in the, in the center.  And then we got, we ordered the, the electronic equipment for audio and visual materials.  And we wanted to get a collection of records and--with music and we had some 3M materials, slides and things indicating the works of art, you know, something in there that, that--that you could use for slides to see the actual work of art, of African American artists and what they looked like.  And that's important.  Color slides were important because the work of African artists is--African American artists like African artists, full of very bright, bold colors.  And that's one of the trademarks so it was important to have the materials so that we could, we could have that available to students in the center.
Story_ID: 168558
Speaker 1: I hate to keep going back to the library [of Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio], but--
Speaker 2: Let's go, going--the library was hard.  The library was hard.  We had a vision of what we wanted to do.  We had a very small budget to start with, and so we started getting books, one or two at a time, literally.  Eventually, my vision was that we expand that collection and we eventually got someone to come in to work in the library to help us with acquisition of books.  At the same time, we had a discussion going on with the, the staff of the library to enable us to catalog those books to have them cross-referenced in the catalogs, in the library catalog, the main library's catalog.  And have a check-out system that was also key to the library's check-out system.  We had that in place within the year so that if, if a student came in and wanted to take out a, a book that was in African American studies, or if they, they could--first of all they could go to the library if they were doing research and they would see references to the books on their subject matter that related to the African American experience.  They could then come into the center and get those books, borrow those books and check them out.  The check-out system was the same.  It would go into the computer and into the database at the lib--at the main library.  They'd get the same notices.  So we were able to keep track of the books, but they would be returned to our collection when they were returned.  We found that the African American students were very respectful of that, and be--and would always--we didn't have very much trouble with having the books brought back.  I think our return rate was better than the library's in fact.  We didn't lose a lot of books.
Speaker 1: That's interesting because a lot of situations, a library in a black cultural center, books bought and put on a shelf without any control and they disappear or they might--you know it's not a formal process for dealing with it.  Also in this regard if I'm not mistaken, the university [Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio] actually pulled books from its African--books about, about and by Africans off the shelves of the main library and brought them to--
Speaker 2: Once we were able to work out that system, yes they did because we had, by that time--I mean through that mechanism we had controls in place.  And so for a time they did have that going on.  I think eventually they--the absorption went the other way and the African American studies collection is now subsumed in their, in their library collection.  I think I liked it better the other way because it was part of a total package and you could come into the Balinga Cultural Center and be in the midst of an atmosphere.  You could feel as I imagine the writers of the Harlem Renaissance and the intellectuals of the Harlem Renaissance might have felt because there was a place we could go for that intellectual exchange and the sharing of ideas.  And that's part of what helps ideas to, to grow and to develop, and that's part of--that, that intellectual community is part of what sparks and generates thinking.  So I, I miss that because the library's a place where you have to be quiet.  But the center was always full of life and the component, the library component--there was an area set aside where you could be quiet.  And there were time of day when you could go in there and expect quiet.  But if you were listening to audio visual materials, you put on your headsets, your earphones and you would not be disturbed by, nor would you disturb those in the other part of the center who were engaged in lively debate.  I re--I remember one of our early debates for example, about the furniture.  I had set the furniture up very nicely into little areas and clusters.  But they were rectangular clusters.  And somebody came in there and said, "You know in Africa it's not the rectangle, but the circle that is important.  I think this furniture should be turned around and changed and put in circles."  I said, "You know, you're probably right, go for it, do it."  So I encouraged the students to, to follow through on their, on their intuitive minds.  And sure enough, he rolled up his sleeves and started moving furniture around and after a while somebody came along and said, "Well what are you doing?  That's a good idea."  And so they, they helped and within the--by the next day we had a new arrangement of the center and it was, it was very comfortable, conforming with African tradition and people were pretty much pleased with that.
Story_ID: 168559
Speaker 1: Now the fall of '70 [1970], now this center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio] is actually being--as the campus watches, is being assembled basically.  And the opening, the official opening of the center was July 15th, 19--
Speaker 2: No, January 15th.
Speaker 1: January.
Speaker 2: Birthday of, of--birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.
Speaker 1: I'm getting my J's mixed up.
Speaker 2: Yes, January 15th.  Interestingly enough, you mentioned people were watching as the center was assembled.  In October there was an issue of the campus newspaper that came out saying how the Balinga Center was a place where black students would hang around and, and have a lounge and it was nothing but a glorified student center and it would foster segregation and just a, a series of accusations about what the center was, and we had not opened our doors officially at that point.  So this inspired us or encouraged us to write out our goals and expectations for the center, to name an advisory committee.  But the goals were academic and, and the as--aspect of inclusiveness was certainly not overlooked--
Story_ID: 168560
Speaker 1: We had one class in there [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio] which grew out of my French, my introduction to French class.  Some students had--that had before French One and French Two, decided that they wanted to take course in negritude, the literature of French speaking Africa--in English, in translation.  So it was a primarily white class being held in the Balinga Black Cultural Center with some black students as well, but mostly white.  And for them it turned out to be an experience because they were being required for the first time to be in a situation that the entire black student body was in at Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio], namely being minority students in a, a situation where they, they were surrounded by others.  And I found that instructive because their response helped me to see what many African Americans must go through as they sit through their classes.  And there was this, this sense that the student was trying to figure out first of all, what was expected of him in this different setting.  Not what the information was that he should know, but what am I supposed to think or say about this material that I'm presented?  And to discover that level of intimidation for students to go--to be made aware of that level of intimidation that students go through when they are in the minority in a situation was revealing for me.  And it just helped me to understand how much greater the effort required for success by an African American student, but also what it, what it means; how much more it means when an African American succeeds with that kind of over against-ness.
Story_ID: 168561
Speaker 1: Now the opening of the center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio] was a big event and the guest list and the activities speak to you know, to the seriousness of the effort I think.  Can, can you talk about maybe you know, who, who was there for the opening and what, what events happened at the opening?
Speaker 2: I'll do my best.  I have a feeling that our--Mr. Crowe knows more about that than I do, having been part of that activity from the point of view of the students and the student involvement.  I remember that among the people we had in our first year.  For the opening itself, I remember that we arranged to get [HM] David Driskell the artist, to bring paintings by Jacob Lawrence.  He was at that time a curator of some of Lawrence's collections or series.  And the series that he came to the center with was the Toussaint L'Ouverture series detailing the history of Haiti and the revolution, and the life of Toussaint L'Ouverture.  Very important and very symbolic for African Americans because this was the first revolution in the new, in the, in the Americas that put an African community in charge of, of a government, leading ac country, to lead a country.  So this was the first black republic in the new world, so to speak.  So I was excited about having that series there, and about having David Driskell as a featured guest.  We also had the ambassador of Ghana, Ambassador [Moises] Debra at the time, who was aware of the arts, and I would even say a patron of the arts.  He had many of the paintings and artworks from Ghana in his home.  And because of that, later we were able to secure for the center a statute by an African sculptor of note.  He was called, I think it was called, 'Unchained.'  I'm not--was that the title?
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: 'Unchained,' it was a, it was a statute of a man in shackles working his way out of the shackles, and you could see him breaking the chains of--which were being held behind his back, as part of the statute.  That's all you see; just the chains beginning to come, beginning to come apart, so you don't see him actually free.  You see him in chains, but the chains broken at the point that is captured by the sculptor, sculptor, a man named--I think his name was--I can't, I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name the students called the statute?  They renamed it, basically.
Speaker 2: No I don't.  Do you?  I gather--
Speaker 1: I thought it was Kabubia [ph.].
Speaker 2: They, they renamed it Kabubia [ph.].
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: Well we gave it a central place in the, in the center as we opened it.  It was a very beautiful, open space, large open space that we could do many things with.  One of the early exhibits that I remember because it fit the space so well, Bing Davis [HM Willis Bing Davis], a Dayton [Ohio] artist, did a series of murals on cloth.  And they were, they were--he hung them himself around the windows of the center, on two sides of the center.  I believe that particular set of, of murals was called, 'Black Dolls,' which interestingly enough is the same as the title of a book by Leon Damas, another one of our early guests at the center, and the father of the Negritude Movement.  One of, one of three fathers of the Negritude Movement.
Story_ID: 168562
Speaker 1: Alex Haley was an early guest [at Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Haley came just, I think just before I left in the, in '71 [1971] or two [1972], to talk about, 'Roots.'  This was before, 'Roots,' had even been published.  And he was talking about the experience he had in going back and, and getting those materials.  One of the things Haley always stressed was the, the amount of work required to uncover some of the information, to document the oral history.  And he talked about going through boxes and boxes of ship records in London [England] in order to get--to find the record of the ship that would have landed in the Gambia, the area where he thought he was from.  He talked about having to talk--using the linguistic clues by talk--and finding out from a linguist where he might have been from, where those words that he had in his vocabulary from the stories that had been passed down; where those words might have come from.  And you get a sense of the quest, but you also get a sense of how difficult this quest is.  By the time he writes the story, it seems to fall in place easily.  But when he tells the story of what he had to do to get that information, you recognize that it was not an easy task because the information isn't easily available, even now.
Story_ID: 168563
Speaker 1: Jimmy Garrett [James Garrett] was another ex-SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] organizer who was an early guest too.
Speaker 2: I didn't remember that.  But I know, I remember, I remember the role that he played in, in SNCC at the time.  Another that I remember is Sam Allen, some of the older people.  I remember the older guests better.
Speaker 1: Scott and Janie Kennedy [Scott J. Kennedy and Janie Sykes Kennedy].
Speaker 2: Scott and Janie Kennedy came.  They were actors.  Scott was at the, at New York--City, City University, City College, City University of New York in the theater, heading the Theater Department there and his wife worked with him in a small theater company that they had.  He had spent time in Ghana documenting African style theater and showing what some of those techniques were.  So I was excited because we had a local theater company in Dayton [Ohio], Theater West headed by Clarence Young, III.  Clarence Young, III.  And I was anxious to see some interaction between the two of them so that they could, they could compare notes and again this, this kind of intellectual dialogue could, could begin, or could be engaged in here in the Midwest and there in Dayton with someone from the east coast who had also traveled to Africa and so that there would be some mutual exchange going on, and that did happen on that occasion.  I think, I think it was very exciting to see and it was very exciting for the Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio] audience and the community audience to be able to have that experience of, of the meeting between Clarence Young, III and, and Scott and Janie Kennedy.
Story_ID: 168564
Speaker 1: Also this, this point--Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio] like a lot of other schools in those days, were able to send students to major history conferences and cultural conferences like the African Heritage Studies Association, or the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History [later, Association for the Study of African American Life and History] or different African student conferences around the state of Ohio and to the center for the black world in Atlanta [sic, Institute of the Black World, Atlanta, Georgia]  In the--their support from the school for those kinds of activities, I mean they--the, the money came from a variety of sources.  Sometimes it was in the cultural center budget, but also it came from student activities and other, other sources.
Speaker 2: That was something I learned to do very well.  You talk about funding here.  And one of the things I learned to do very well was to take a very small budget and get multiple usage out of it by tapping into things that came--that were in other people's interest.  For example, we at one point invited--and when I say we, Wright State at one point invited [John William] Gardner, the author of the book on excellence ['Excellence'], to speak.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the founder of Common Cause.
Speaker 2: Founder of Common Cause, author of the book on excellence.
Story_ID: 168565
Speaker 1: We were discussing various ways that you can use a budget to, you know, enrich the activities of the Bolinga Center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center] at Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio].  Now one other way that, that I think--
Speaker 2: I didn't finish that, I didn't quite finish that statement.  We, we--someone else, another person's budget was bringing [John William] Gardner in, but--Bill Gardner in, but then he spoke at the center.  So that helped to enhance the image of the center and it helped to make it more a part of the full campus life and not just something segregated and apart for black students.  We were trying to make it clear that this was something for the community and for the student body as a whole to appreciate and better understand African American life and culture.
Story_ID: 168566
Speaker 1: Also I think this, this also had something to do with your, your pursuit of your Ph.D. too.  You were able to use that to enrich the life of the center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center, Wright State, Dayton, Ohio] as well.  I remember there was an occasion where Kipng'eno Koech from Kenya you know, who was also, he was a student in religion I guess too, theology.
Speaker 2: I don't remember where he was studying, but he may have been a student of religion because I met him through the Consortium of Higher Education and Religion Studies, or Chairs at--which was part of the Dayton Miami Valley Consortium of activities.  And we actually ended up publishing a book as a result of that one year long symposium which Kip Koech [Kipng'eno Koech] had been a presenter for that on the, on the issue of folklore.
Speaker 1: Right, the Wright State--
Speaker 2: And I believe he was als--he also then subsequently came to our opening on the 15th of, of January, Martin Luther King's birthday.
Speaker 1: And taught Kiswahili later on.
Speaker 2: And late, yes, we later invited him to teach Kiswahili.
Speaker 1: The Religion Department was very interested in what he had to say about African mythology and culture and the folklore of his people, the Kipsigis in Kenya, Willis Stoesz and Dr. Herbert Neve were both very much involved in that and they brought their students in for this.  And that was another way that the larger student pop--population could focus in on--
Speaker 2: I tried to include the professors from other History Department, the Literature Department, whenever we were doing something that would be of interest to any of them.  And that, that was an exciting development when Bill Stoesz brought his class in-Stoesz has a, a national reputation in the field of religion, so this--it was a coup so to speak, to be able to include him in our activities and to have him see the center as a resource for his--for what he was doing as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the--when you say too that the libation ceremony that now Dr. Koech brought to the Bolinga Center is now being practiced in Dayton and Columbus [Ohio] and Cincinnati [Ohio], even as we speak.  The same one.  So I mean it's now--these things ripple out, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's, that's very interesting.  At that time I think some of us didn't know what a libation was.  But that reminds me that my grandmother once had a, a new bathroom installed in her home.  And when the, the restoration was completed, she called us all together and did a libation.  She said we have to pour libation for this new installation.  So libation was a part of our tradition.  It was a part that got lost often, but--and I guess it's practiced in different ways in different parts of Africa.  So I'm glad that Kip [Kipng'eno Koech] brought, brought it back to us in a way that we can, can still--that is still being used.  That's getting to be more popular as a, a way of opening a lot of different events and ceremonies in the African American community now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 168567
Speaker 1: Another little thing--these students playing mancala in the Bolinga Center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio] instead of playing bid whist as they used to do in the cafeteria, was another change (unclear).
Speaker 2: The Oware, the Oware board, yes.
Speaker 1: Mancala--
Speaker 2: Mancala.
Speaker 1: Different names for it.
Speaker 2: The mancala name, it's interesting that you mention that because I didn't learn until I started teaching here that mancala is the Philippine version of the Oware game.  And what I discovered was that there's a group back off in the mountains of some of the Philippine islands that practices African culture, including using--dancing with masks and having ceremonies and rituals that probably go back to ancient Africa.  I, I wonder how they got there.  And I'm sure that some of the genome studies will probably--some of the DNA will probably help us trace that one of these days.  But at the moment I guess it's still a mystery.  We know that these are African people, and we know that they have things like mancala in common with people of other--from other parts of, of Africa, from parts of Africa.  But the Oware game apparently goes across the continent, in addition to being in the Philippines.
Story_ID: 168568
Speaker 1: Now there was an occasion which kind of speaks somewhat to maybe disparities of budget, interest too maybe black universities and the other universities.  Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio], I mean the Bolinga Center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center] at Wright State brought Charles Young collection of African objects and artifacts and brought back over to the United States by Colonel Charles Young who resided at Wilberforce [Ohio].  He brought them back from Liberia when he was there, you know working as a soldier, building the canals in Liberia back in the 1890s.  He bring--he brought these back in a huge collection of African art, basically and it had never been exhibited in Wilberforce.  You arranged to bring it to Wright State and students from Wilberforce then would get on the bus and come to Wright State to see it.  Which is--
Speaker 2: It's a bit of irony there.  But it's, it's interesting.  Sometimes you don't know the worth of what you have and if you grow up believing that you have no value, you may not understand the value of the things that are a part of your life.  And I think that that may have been true at Wilberforce.  I, I still remember one day while I was at--a student at--while I was working at Wilberforce before I came to Wright State, [HM] Sonia Sanchez was coming over to Central State University [Wilberforce, Ohio] and I was all excited to go over.  And I saw the English teacher coming into the campus as I was going out.  And--one of the English teachers--and I said to her are you going over to hear Sonia Sanchez?  She said I'm on my way to class.  And I'm thinking to myself that's the kind of event you wanna take your class to.  But she did not know who Sonia Sanchez was and this was of course in the '70s [1970s] and maybe before Sonia Sanchez was as well know as she is now, but I think it speaks to this very issue that you're talking about.  You don't recognize your own value.  Because in graduate school and this was--this person was studying for her doctorate degree.  In graduate school, they don't give you the doctorate based on what you know about African American life and culture and that's not part of the curriculum.  But it also speaks to why it's so important to make it part of the curriculum because that was an important part of the heritage.  In the Dayton [Ohio] area we had at Central State and at--I had made the discovery of some of these--this artwork at Central and at Wilberforce during the time when I had been working over there.  And I had discovered that we had things like original Augusta Savage, an original Tanner's [Henry Ossawa Tanner] in the basement of the library at Central State University.  This is the kind of thing that I wanted to have exhibited at Wright State.  I knew it was there.  I knew it wasn't being used; I knew it was in the basement; I knew it was collecting dust and not, not--that we were not aware of it.  And I wanted to give the community a chance to share that.  It is ironic that that had to happen at Wright State rather than at Wilberforce.  But as I think about it, if there had been an exhibit at Wilberforce, I doubt if people would have come from Dayton to see it.  On the other hand when we took it over into Dayton, the students from Wilberforce were able to get to see it in a different setting and to see it lifted up so to speak, in a way that it wasn't being lifted up on their own campuses.  Now shortly after that, there was a, a series of tornadoes that devastated Wilberforce, destroyed buildings on both campuses, or damaged them heavily.  One--a couple of people were killed in that tornado at Wilberforce.  And one of the things that happened is that I, I never, I never knew, I have not heard to this day what may have become of some of those things that we exhibited at--in, in that collection that day.  Especially the things that had been in the basement of the libraries, the two libraries at Wilberforce and Central.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 168569
Speaker 1: Now you, you were at Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio] for two years or was it a year and a half?
Speaker 2: It may have been three.  I was there from--well actually from 19--fall of 1970 to January of '70-'73 [1973] I believe was the year that I left.  No wait a minute, it wasn't '73 [1973].  January of 19--I think it was '73 [1973].  So I was there nearly--about two and a half years, about two and a half years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now what--well why did you leave?  I mean what, what was the--what happened?
Speaker 2: That was a family situation.  My husband moved to--relocated to the Washington, D.C. area and I had to follow him if we were to keep the family together.  So that was, that was what happened.  We, we--Washington was home, so it was a good move from that point of view.  But it's hard to leave the best job you ever loved.  And that was certainly true for me leaving Wright State.  It was a very hard thing to do because I felt as though I had begun something that was truly creative and truly consistent with the whole purpose of my work up to that point.  I had been studying, trying to get a degree in African American studies for the purpose of, of lifting up to an academic level the study of African culture and to look at how African culture and African American culture came together.  And I wanted to see that this thing called relevance in education.  I wanted to see education made relevant to the African American experience by, by including it first of all, including it in such a way that African Americans could begin to have pride and be--and to recover from the damage to their self-esteem that had been traditional.  I think that that happened as a result of the Bolinga Center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center].  It was exciting to go back thirty years later and see that the center still existed, and still had a home, and was still important to the, to the student community there.
Story_ID: 168570
Speaker 1: And so when you, when you got back to [Washington] D.C., to Washington, the Washington area, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Finding a job, looking for a job again.  That was the hard, that was a hard thing, especially since I was just about to give birth to my third child.  My youngest was born in August of '73 [1973].  And shortly after that I was hired to work on Capitol Hill.  Goler Butcher, who you may know, I think I introduced you to her.  Goler Butcher was working for Congressman Charles Diggs at the time, and she interviewed me and decided that I would fit in well with what they were doing there.  My interest in Africa, not just an interest, but my travel in Africa, my study of Africa, was consistent with what the Congressman was trying to do.  He was very--he was chairman of the subcommittee on Africa in the United States Congress at that time.  I came on board that fall I believe, to be a part of the--in charge of--his staff person for international community affairs on the, on the District of Columbia Committee.
Story_ID: 168571
Speaker 1: This seems like a key position for you to be in, or exciting place to be at the time because of the [Charles] Diggs, large, the large black community in Detroit [Michigan] that he represented and the increasing interest in what was going on on the continent of Africa.  It was starting to really burgeon, you know at this point.  And what, what were some of your experiences with--on the staff of Congressman Diggs?
Speaker 2: It was an exciting time to be working with Congressman Diggs because of his interest in Africa and he was on the forefront of what was going on there at the time.  That was the period of the--when the winds of change were blowing in southern Africa.  A part of the world where people at that time were saying it would be at least another fifty years.  One of the things that I saw, that I witnessed to, the Congressman had done some hearings, he was doing hearings on the situation with the Portuguese colonies in Africa.  His position was that independence was not that far away in Portuguese speaking Africa and that it would be tied to what was going on in Portugal.  When the Portuguese government fell, he had just had hearings in which the government, the United States government was taking the standard position that change was at least fifty years away.  And the Congressman was saying, but what if the government of Portugal falls?  What if there is a change of government there, what will that mean?  And I think State Department was feeling that it wouldn't mean anything, that it wouldn't change anything with respect to Africa.  But within a few months, Portugal had changed regimes and I think it wasn't more than a couple of months after that, that the Portuguese territories gained their independence.  So I witnessed to that and I saw the Congressman's foresight, both in holding the hearings and in raising the kinds of questions that he did to, to point out and to help our U.S. policy become prepared, our U.S. policymakers become prepared for what was happening in Africa.
Story_ID: 168572
Speaker 1: Another thing that I witnessed too, he [Congressman Charles Diggs] was doing hearings in South Africa. And when he went to South Africa, he was being either confined to the airport, or treated--given the status of honorary, honorary white person so that he could travel through the city.  And at some point he decided to, to make a stand.  And so he was refused entry into the country at another point.  It was a--but the hearings, the hearings themselves were very important in, again in moving, in moving us closer.  He raised the issue of boycotting both South African company--or companies in South Africa under apartheid, American companies in South Africa under apartheid.  And countries in what was then southern Rhodesia.  And that boycott of, of southern Rhodesian companies in particular, led to the creation of Zimbabwe.  So I was there during--I was in the office during the period when these things were going on and people were coming into his off-into the Congressman's office from Africa, including--I remember meeting a young woman from South Africa who had been banned.  And that meant that she was confined to her home and was not able to, was not able to meet with anyone.  She could never be around more than two or three people at a time for any reason, including her family members because of the status of being "banned."  And that was--to hear her story was a revelation for me.  It was revealing to me.  And it got me more attuned to some of the political issues of African independence at that time.  So it was an exciting, a very exciting time to be in the Congressman's office.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, now how, how long was it--I mean what was your tenure there?
Speaker 1: How long did I stay there.
Speaker 2: Stay there, yeah.
Speaker 1: I was there from, I guess, I guess about two years.  I left, I left there after two years.
Story_ID: 168573
Speaker 1: One of the last things that I did while I was there was he attended the Pan African--what was it--the Sixth Pan African Congress.  And so--
Speaker 2: This is in '76 (1976).
Speaker 1: In, no--it was '74 [1974] I believe, 'cause I had left there by '76 [1976].  Must have been '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: This was in Tanzania.
Speaker 1: The one in Tanzania.  The first one on African soil.  The one that was promoted by C.L.R. James and others.  But he [Congressman Charles Diggs] was, he was an attendee there and gave a, a speech there.  So as I very often did, I was able to do some of the research that--and work with him in terms of the contents of that speech.  I say work with him.  The Congressman was very much his own person and wrote all his own speeches and knew much more about most things than his staff did.  So it was a learning experience for me, and I felt very privileged to have been witness to some of the thinking that went into, into that--into his presentation at that event.
Story_ID: 168574
Speaker 1: I think at the same time period weren't you involved in Africare as well?  You had been involved in that.
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  Africare--this-'73 [1973], '74 [1974] was the year--this was the year of the initial discovery of the great drought of Af--the great African drought.  And it was also the year of the founding of Africare.  Now that was more of a coincidence than anything else.  The vision of Africare was to work on African development, or to, to lift up possibilities for development in Africa and to do fundraising for development projects in Africa, including water and some other things.  But what happened was that with the drought, we got caught up initially in raising funds to meet the immediate needs of people who were in drought, drought--the drought areas.  But we had the additional vision of pro--of going beyond the time of the drought to get into development, Africare did.  And, and I was--while I was in the Congressman's [Congressman Charles Diggs]office, both Africare and a group called RAINS [ph.] for relief in the Sahel.  I think the--I'm not sure what the initials stood for exactly.  But both those groups came into existence.  One of them led by Herschelle Challenor.  The Congressman was giving a lot of attention to RAINS.  But Africare was not something that he--I don't think he was very familiar with Africare.  So it was during that time that Africare began to be part of, of the landscape.  I, I had known [HM] C. Payne Lucas, the head of Africare as--when we were all students in--at America--at the American University [Washington, D.C.], now American University, in the political science department.  An so for that reason, I was in touch with C. Payne as he start--and, and following the developments of Africare, as well as the development of RAINS and very appreciative of the, of the vision of Africare for not just to meet the immediate need.  Not just supplying the fish, but supplying the fish hooks; very appreciative of that mission.  So I, I began to work with the local committee a couple of years after that.  I had left the Congressman's office by the time I began to volunteer for the local committee of Africare.  And as a result of, of volunteering on the local committee, eventually I was invited to become part--the first African American--the first woman of any--the first woman on the board of Africare, you could understand that.  Africare has always been a very diverse--had a very diverse board, but it didn't have any women until 1977, and I was the first.  But I was the first of several, and that was the beginning of the trend.  We got other women in after that.
Story_ID: 168575
Speaker 1: You completed your Ph.D. around this time, didn't you?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.  I completed the Ph.D. in 1974.  And that coincided with the time of--it was just around the same time that I left Congressman [Charles] Diggs' office.  And I went to work--I taught at Howard [University, Washinton, D.C.] for a while, and I'm not sure what the chronology is here.  I'm a little--it's, it's been a while ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dr. Adams [HM Dr. Russell Adams] says you rescued him at Howard.
Speaker 2: Is that right?  I came to Howard and taught there for--when I left the Congressman's office.  Then I also taught part time at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] in their Black Studies Program.  And that was an exciting experience because I developed the course there on the African woman.  And again, very exciting work because again I had a vision of what a women's study course should look like.  I thought it should focus on the relationship between African American males and African American females, what some of the special challenges were, how they interacted and so on.  And to a great degree, that course addressed the mythology of the--the contrasts between the myths about African American families and the reality.  So that you know, you have the myth of the black matriarch and I, I began to ask my students just as an experiment, well what is your ideal African American woman?  What is--what's your ideal woman look like for the men.  And for the women, what do you think the ideal is?  And it was interesting because the women thought the ideal was one thing and the men came up with something else.  But what they came up with was the strong black woman was their ideal of the, of, of the kind of African American woman they wanted to be around.  You get the sense sometimes that African American men don't want a strong black woman in their lives; that they're--that, that somehow this diminishes them.  But the reality is that the African American man does want a strong black woman in his life; that he prefers that; that he prefers a woman who knows who she is and is willing to share responsibility with him for the family.
Story_ID: 168576
Speaker 1: This is around the time of FESTAC [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture], you got--you were really involved in the development of FESTAC '77 [1977] and you're one of the few people that we know of that attended both of those.
Speaker 2: That is correct.  That is correct.
Speaker 1: '66 [1966] in Dakar [Senegal] and this, this one that was being planned for, I think it had been planned for earlier, but it finally took place in 1977.
Speaker 2: '77 [1977], yes.  I think they were plan--they were trying to have them initially every five years so that it was around--I think '66 [1966], then it got extended because of problems in Nigeria.  And eventually it did not happen until '77 [1977].  There was a time when it looked like it wasn't going to happen at all because people were saying why should we spend so much money?  The money that's going to be required to make the city presentable for strangers to build an arena to hold the--to hold the events in, the main events in.  To build a, an auditorium for the musical and, and theatrical events.  Why should we spend that money when there's so much poverty in the city?
Speaker 1: The, the fallout of that is too that the people in retrospect look at the money that the Nigerian government spent--many come to the conclusion that the Nigerian government overspent and in order to impress the rest of the world, just overdid it.  Did you have that impression?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have that sense.  I had the sense that a lot of good came out of that, that there was a pride in Africa and that--and I was glad that the decision was made to go forth with the, with the, with the festival in spite of the cost because I, I felt that there was a, an international payback, a global payback from that.  That it would advance the cause of Pan Africanism, that it would allow Africans all over the world to see their strength, and to recognize elements of culture that they'd been putting aside and denying and making light of.  To life those up and to see the, the pervasiveness of those elements of culture and how they had made a difference in the rest of the world in some cases.  For example, African cuisine you find all over the world now.  The--everybody loves gumbo, and we never think of this as something that came out of Africa, but it did.  The west Indian, some of the west Indian dishes.  Callaloo for example, it comes out of Africa.  That cuisine has traveled around the world and back again.  And we wouldn't have--we would not have thought about some of those connections in the same way had we not seen this gathering.  I was so impressed at the festival with seeing the, the last day of the festival and the first day too, they had every delegation do some kind of presentation or walk--by walking around the, the arena.  The Dahomey group, now Benin, put on shackles and reminded us that that had been the slave coast.  The group from the West Indies had on their large ruffled dresses and the men had on their ruffled blouses and--or bare breasted you know to, to--and, and danced some of the West Indian dances.  And it was just a wonderful thing to see all these people coming together.
Story_ID: 168577
Speaker 1: You were asking about the--my involvement with the fest--the 1977 FESTAC [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria].  Yes, I did work for a time officially as the--on the staff of [HM] Jeff Donaldson.  Jeff--with Jeff Donaldson on the American participation in the festival until the money ran out.  And when the money ran out, he had to cut back.  But I was very much interested in U.S. participation and was instrumental of course in encouraging some people to, to apply to be part of the delegation and so on.  But in the end, I had left the, committee by the time the festival occurred.  I did go to the festival, however.
Speaker 2: And you gave us some impressions of the festival.  But, but what, what, what did the festival consist of?  Was it just art and, and--what was--what was it?
Speaker 1: One of the things that I had done during the time that I was with the American committee was to look for African American scientists because we wanted to have--we were looking at a science component to the festival as well.  And we had Dr.--we, we had a couple of the prominent African American scientists who were working in areas like solar energy and so forth, who were part of the festival; who, who were trying to get to be part of the festival and to help us to put together--put forward a proposal for scientific participation.  That, that to me was an exciting, exciting thing.  But it was--so it was not just art.  It was also sociology.  We had--I met the delegation for example from Australia.  And they were talking about how the Aborigines in Australia.  In fact this was a group of persons with Aborigines background who participated in FESTAC from Australia.  And they were talking about how Australians attribute their heritage to Africa and, and link themselves to the African continent.  I think that was the first time I had known that.  So there was a sociological component for me in going to the festival in addition to the cultural component.  And with respect to the cultural component, that too was diverse with paintings.  They had an art gallery that had paintings.  They had--and that had been true at the first festival as well.  That art, art and sculpture were part of it.  But that, that particular FESTAC, Stevie Wonder attended.  And he received the Grammy award for, 'Songs in the Key of Life,' from the stage of the theater in Dakar [sic, Lagos, Nigeria] where he was performing and I happened to be there that night.  So it was a, a--I felt as though it were a double or triple witness to history by attending that festival; quite an exciting event.
Speaker 2: It was a colloquial too on culture, politics and--it was--public radio even ran some of it--national public radio here.  It was (unclear) Charlie Cobb [Charles E. Cobb, Jr.] I think from National Public Radio, recorded a lot of the colloquial which included, you know, luminaries from Africa and the United States.
Speaker 1: That may have happened before I got there.  I was only there for the last few days of the festival, which took place over a period of, of two months I believe, two or three months.  No, about two months.  I was there at the end of February and I believe it started in early January.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right. Anything else you wanna say about FESTAC?
Speaker 1: No, just, just to re--well there is one thing that I remember from there.  I, I was talking about some of the events that I remember from there.  One of them was the Nigerian contingent was doing stilt dancing.  And I remember after that going to the West Indies with my mom and there was a stilt dancer that came out and my mom said, "Moko jumbie."  And so for the first time I'm associating this stilt dancing phenomenon with Africa and with the West Indies.  And then I, I found a book one day in a library--during the time I was at Wright State [University, Dayton, Ohio].  I found a book by Douglas (unclear), which he had a little studio in a place called Goes [Goes Station], Ohio, just outside of Yellow Springs, which is on the road between Yellow Springs--Goes is on the road between Yellow Springs and Wilberforce, so I pass it on the way home from work.  And there's a picture in that book which came off of the walls of the--the drawings of Tassli n'Ajjer in Algeria that had been preserved for some ten or 12,000 years now.  And, and in that group of drawings are these stilt dancers with their legs covered in grass leggings and so forth.  Just like they looked at FESTAC.  So FESTAC has been very, very helpful to me in trying to make some of the connections that are so elusive when you're dealing with retentions of African culture in Western life.
Story_ID: 168578
Speaker 1: What are some of these retentions and this is something that I don't think a lot of people in this area think about.  They're aware, but they can't--it's hard for them to pin down.  What, what are some of these retentions?
Speaker 2: That's a very good question and I don't--where can I start?  One of the places I like to start is with names because it's such a, an easy thing to do.  Some people are not aware that names that are passed down in the family actually came out of Africa.  In my family the name Ida for example, my aunt was Ida.  And I discovered later that my great-grandmother was also Ida.  What I did not know until very recently, is that Ida is a Wolof name, it's a name that comes out of, of Senegal in West Africa.  But it's their version of the name of one of the wives of the prophet Muhammad.  So that my grandmother is talking about her French West African ancestor, she's talking about a Muslim woman.  And I know that now, I didn't recognize it at the time that my grandmother was going around the house saying--inviting people into her home with, "As-Salamu Alaikum, Wa Alaikam As-Salaam," peace be unto you, unto you be peace.  She always did that.  She greeted people, she told them the words in, in Arabic and in English.  But I didn't recognize that this came out of her French West African background as a, a fruit of this influence of Islam in our culture over the years.  Recently I found an exhibit down at the Thurgood Marshall YMCA Building, they had an exhibit on Muslims in the greater Washington [D.C.] area.  And one of the things that they used was the way that the wills were started in the--I think it's in the name of God, and they go on from there.  It was done in English, but it's a translation from the Arabic and the way that people begin things that they're serious about with, with the statement, "in the name of God, the beneficent and the merciful".  There were other connec--they also talk about--but they also talked about the names of some of the families that have come out of, of, of the Arabic tradition living in the Washington area.  And those names are, are listed and they can follow them and find them.  Are those names African names?  Some of them may be transformations of African names, the name Fallo [ph.] may be Diallo [ph.] may be--if you, if you look at the kind of rice we eat.  We talk--we see it a lot in, in foods.  We talk about jollof rice.  Jollof is another way of saying Wolof [ph.].  So it's the same part of Africa that we're talking about when we talk about jollof rice, a part of Senegal.  A part of the Senegambia tradition.  Some of the retentions are regional.  That is to say that we find them in large numbers in regional, certain regional areas.  So if you go down to South Carolina, you're gonna see baskets, you're gonna find rice, you're gonna find rice dishes.  Most of that is part of the Guinea tradition that people were brought from Guinea to plant and grow and, and process the rice crops in, in North and South Carolina.  And so you still find that basket making and basket weaving passed down from generation to generation, uses the, the same kind of techniques and the same kinds of styles in the making of the basket that was used in Africa.  And some people have come here from Sierra Leone for example and been able to say they do these baskets just like this in my village, or in a village near where I live.  Another--so, so the actual things, specific things--the way that nets are made, the way that furniture is carved, the way that the, the mortar.  You see we use mortar and pestle here.  And some of them are old and some--the mortar and pestle itself is an African tradition for grinding.  We use it in apothecary or we might grind garlic with it now, but that tradition--that's something that comes--that tool is something that comes out of Africa.

Speaker 1: Let's see.  So I've talked about names and--names are, names are easy because you can have some kind of an access to them.  And sometimes people doing family histories discover names.  There's a family here that always does its reunion and--the Kwander [ph.] family.  They recently discovered that there's a, a, a village in Ghana that has a name that's very much like Kwada [ph.].  And they believe that that is the village of their origin and the origin of their name.  So names are, are fun in terms of--and to follow and to check on in terms of, in terms of retentions.  Food is another fun thing to follow in terms of retentions.  What are some of the foods that came over?  What are some of the dishes that you find?  I was amazed to find when I went to Congo [Democratic Republic of the Congo] that the word for greens is the same in Africa, green.  The word in Lingala is ya mpnd, which means green.  It's a green leaf.  In the West Indies it's dasheen which is used--the leaf that's used to make these greens out of, especially the Callaloo dish.  And so it kind of makes me feel well greens is something that comes out of our tradition, to prepare greens that way with season, season the way that we do and cooking, cooking them down.  That's part of the African tradition.  We don't think about it, but there it is.  Another retention besides names and, and food.  Sometimes simple things.  I remember describing to a group once the way people swept out their compounds in the morning at the hospital where I had gone to visit and someone would come out every morning and they had a homemade broom made with leaves and they're tied together at the top, you know.  And you take this little short broom and sweep out the, the compound and it's just a dirt floor.  But it's very neatly swept every morning.  And as I was describing this, somebody said--and not a, not an African American, but a Caucasian person said I remember growing up and seeing that in my childhood in Georgia, seeing people sweep the area like that every day.
Speaker 2: Swept the yards (unclear).
Speaker 1: Swept yards comes out of that.  Again, probably part of the Congo tradition.  But we won't know that until we begin to lift up for study the cultural anthropology.  To begin to study cultural anthropology and to begin to lift up in a more systematic way our study of Africa and our study of here.  Looking at the movie, "Daughters of the Dust", which came out a few years ago, Julie Dash, Dash's movie; you see a lot of that.  One of the things I hadn't seen before was this bottle tree that is central to the theme of the movie there.  I discovered that bottle trees exist in many parts of the United States, Texas in the south.  But they also exist in the West Indies,  one of my students from Jamaica remembered seeing them in her childhood.  So we're gonna have to do more in terms of what those retentions are, but I think even wattle and daub construction, the way that the houses were made in those days, is typical of the way that houses were made in for example Ghana, West Africa.  There's some pictures of houses of the seven--dating back to the seventh century in Ghana and they look very much like some of the houses constructed by slaves for the slave quarters in South Carolina that you see in paintings going back to the 17th and 18th centuries.
Story_ID: 168580
Speaker 1: Now is it time to talk about the, the Unitarian Universal Association?  I mean you're becoming a minister.  You became the first ordained woman minister in the Unitarian Universal Association.
Speaker 2: That is correct.  And that was a challenge.  I guess we have to spend a little bit of time on it because I certainly spent a good deal of my life on that. When I--sometime in the nine--during the 19--sometime after the festival of 1977, I realized--my grandmother was ill at that time.  And it was her death, at her death that I got the call to ministry.  My grandmother had been a minister; she'd been a bishop in her--in the Pentecostal tradition.  So when she died, she blew her last breath on me and tended to think that that was not an accident because, especially because she apparently had waited until I got there.  And I, I just--as I walked in the door, she was told by my mother [Beatrice Reed] "Yvonne is here".  She opened her eyes and exhaled as I crossed the threshold and came to her bedside.  And I knew then that she had waited for me to get there.  And I felt that as a call to ministry.  When I went into ministry, I did--I was a member of the Unitarian Church here, All Souls Unitarian under David Eaton, and I think I'd been inspired to do that by the Jubilee Singers, a gospel singing group that had--at that time was being directed by Ysaye Barnwell.  Ysaye subsequently became part of Sweet Honey and the Rock, so she's not doing--she's not directing the choir at All Souls anymore.  But that had inspired me to get into All Souls.  And so when I was in divinity school, I was part of All Souls Church.  And consequently I was encouraged by my mentor, Leon Wright [ph.], to go forward with the process for becoming a minister within the denomination.  I did enter into fellowship and was ordained in the fall of 1981 as the first African American woman to be ordained in the Unitarian Universalist Church.  There had been twenty males ordained prior to that.
Story_ID: 168581
Speaker 1: But for the most part, they had not been settled in Unitarian Universalist churches.  I don't know why I thought I could do something different.  I had, I had read a book by Fritz Morri--, I'm sorry, by Mark Morrison-Reed, born Mark Reed.  He took his wife's name when he, when he married and she took his, so there was exchange there.  But he wrote a book on the tradition of African Americans in the Unitarian Universalist denomination.  And it's not a pretty story.  One man, his, his son committed suicide.  He--because of the inability his father had to get preaching jobs and support his family, it just led to a troubled childhood for them.  And he was a brilliant, he was nonetheless a brilliant minister and a, a very compassionate human being who clearly was Unitarian and Universalist in his belief.  And when I say Unitarian Universalist, Unitarian--the belief in one god as--and lifting up the one god as opposed to the trinity, which is consistent with Islam, by the way.  And Universalist in this conception that in the belief that all human beings have the possibility of, of salvation.  So universal salvation is the, is the basic theme of the Universalist tradition in Unitarian Universalism.
Speaker 2: Now are Unitarians Christians by definition or, or--
Speaker 1: Unitarianism grew out of a--it is a form of Christian, Christianity, it's both Christian and denominational.  That is to say that the polity of the church is governed, or the church is governed by the congregational assembly.  So this is a ser--they--it's an outgrowth of the congregation.  Unitarianism is an outgrowth of the congregational church.  And I think the difference between Unitarianism and congregationalism is simply the difference of a focus on trinity versus the focus on unity; the oneness of God.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That God is one.
Speaker 2: So okay.
Speaker 1: So that Jesus is a prophet in that tradition and [Ralph Waldo] Emerson said it very--best.  He says that Jesus is the, is the only--I think he says Jesus is the only perfect human being, or the most perfect human being.  Jesus, Jesus is the perfect human being, but he is a human being.  And the focus is on God within the Unitarian church.  But you have a, a--so yes it is a Christian church by definition.  Christian in the sense of focus on the life of Jesus and its meaning for our understanding of God and the way that it informs our understanding of God.
Speaker 2: Okay so you couldn't be a Unitarian if you didn't believe in Jesus (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yes you could.  And many, many believe in--many fall into that category.  Persons who do not--some, some say they don't believe in God, but yet they claim Unitarianism.  I'm not--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I heard this.  That's why, you know--
Speaker 1: It is, it is confusing.  And we ask--we--in our churches we ask all the time, well what is it that binds us together?  And what we truly believe in is the necessity for the quest for understanding that which is greater than ourselves.  And, and that, that is part of the human condition.  We see that as, as, as central to the human condition.  And that's why we have church to help us to support one another in this quest.  But we don't claim to have all the answers like most denominations do.  And we are open to a variety of responses to that--to the questions that inevitably arise when we're dealing with issues of spirit.
Story_ID: 168582
Speaker 1: Okay, now this has--now your Ph.D. was in--what--I, I know you got--
Speaker 2: In African and African American studies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My degree before that was in political science.
Speaker 1: All right, and your dissertation for your Ph.D. was about--
Speaker 2: About the curriculum, ideal curriculum for an African American studies program.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And that was just--at that time it was part of the discussion and debate because there was no answer to that question at the time.  So this was the beginning of, of opening up discussion in that area.
Speaker 1: The reason why I ask is because you, you seem to have demonstrated throughout your life a keen interest in spirituality, and I wondered if that was a part of the dissertation at the time.
Speaker 2: It's--let me put it this way.  It's clear to me that you cannot engage African ontology without dealing with African spirituality.  In other words, if you're going to try to understand African culture, an important aspect of African culture is religion, it's interwoven, it's woven into--its part and parcel of culture in the African worldview, or in, in the variety of African worldviews because they're not all--it's not--Africa's not a monoclinic thing.  And so to that extent, African spirituality was a very important part of my engaging the dialogue with African culture.  Trying to understand what that spirituality was.  And one of the things that I came up with in my dissertation was the notion that in the African worldview, there is a tendency to look toward the whole, which is the divine.  The divine is the expression of the whole.  And to try to fit the parts that we see and know into a larger picture.  And not the other way around as we tend to do with science.  Take the small piece that we know and analyze it until we know everything there is to know about it, but we still don't know how it fits into the larger picture.  So what that translates to is a, a, I think a larger role for spirituality in the African worldview than it has in the western worldview where science is in, in effect the, the major part of the equation.  If we take, if we take that over to the Unitarian universalist tradition, what we find in Unitarian universalism is that that has been the home for rational thought and rational thinkers for the most part.  For those who are trying to put priority on the physics rather than the metaphysics.  But what I have always done as an African person is to look at the way that physics and metaphysics come together.  I'm reading a book now, a study on--what is--I think it's called, 'Destructive Emotions,' and it's written in collaborat--collaboration with the Dalai Lama.  And one of the findings there is that the--first of all the great interest of the fourteenth Dalai Lama in science was a surprise to many.  But some of the things that he's saying helped me to see once again what I've discovered in my own exploration of metaphysics, that basically the answers in metaphysics are very, very close to the answers in physics.  Principle of uncertainty [Heisenberg's uncertainty principle], (unclear) the-(unclear) photography.  The--what are those little--the, the, the kind of photography that you take an image and if you cut that image up, you discover that the image--the whole image is present on every fragment of the image.  There's just a number of areas where the science of--the answers of science or the realities of--the observations of science are very consistent with the observations that I make in metaphysics, the metaphysical observations that I've made.  And I think in studying Africa, I came to understand that in a different way.  I came to understand the extent to which spirituality is a part of our lives.
Story_ID: 168583
Speaker 1: I grew up thinking nothing of the conversations my grandmother had with the spirit world.  This dynamic relationship between the unborn, the living and the ancestors, and all of them involved in the divine, or part of the divine.  That's something that is very familiar to me.  And so the observation I make in my thesis is that that observation of going from part to whole, seeking to understand the whole from the fragment as opposed to seeking to understand the fragment better and completely and, and seeing only that fragment and, and analyzing that fragment.  No, the focus is not on the fragment.  The focus is always outward to the whole, the larger picture.
Story_ID: 168584
Speaker 1: Yes, let me ask you about the, the problem of being settled in the Unitarian [Universalist] Church.  Now you, you were ordained in--what year was it?
Speaker 2: In 1981.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-one [1981].  And, and I think part of the problem as I understand is being settled in the church.  What does that mean for the layman, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: That--being settled, as I mentioned it's a congregational polity.  So that every church has the right to invite their own minister to come in.  Now we have a system that requires credentialing through the national, at the national level.  That is fellowship, which means that you have--you're guaranteed that the person has a certain academic background, there's also psychological test that's a component of this process of becoming fellowshipped in the Unitarian Church.  So there's a, a national process of credentialing that goes on.  But then the churches themselves have the right to call their ministers.  Now what that meant for me was that I had to do portfolios and mail them out and go, go before interviews, and that's a full time job in itself; getting interviews and preparing portfolios and so forth.  That's, that's a full time--it takes a lot of time; it takes up a lot of time and energy.  So I was doing that, but at the same time that I was doing that, people were for various reasons, decide--the churches themselves were for various reasons deciding that they "weren't ready" for a black woman minister.  And sometimes--
Speaker 1: That's the way you--I think it was expressed; they weren't ready for a black woman minister?
Speaker 2: Most of the time.  Sometimes it would be, you know, the different, the difference would be why they weren't ready.  Some churches weren't ready because they had just had a situation where--or a negative situation with, with a male minister who had come in and, and been indiscreet with the ladies of the church.  And so that translated--as well we're not, we're not interested in a single minister at this time.  So you know the, the--or, or we couldn't deal with both your being single and black at this time because of this history.  And so you would find that, that kind of response in a lot of different forms during that period.  I was also at that point much more Christian than I am now in the sense of seeing Jesus as my personal savior and, and seeing a larger role for Jesus in my theology than it has now.  Jesus is still important in my theology, but not Jesus the son of God, more Jesus the son of man.  And like me, a child of God.  But one certainly who is much more gifted than I was and much more endowed by God with, with a task or a challenge to do, a task to do.
Story_ID: 168585
Speaker 1: Eventually I came to see that my own task within Unitarian Universalism was to change the denomination; not to be changed by it.  I felt as though in order to be accepted, I would have to become someone other than I was.  I would have to give up my Afro centricity, and I wasn't willing to do that.  So I began to look at how does the denomination need to change.  And the conclusion I came to was that the denomination has always been open, but it has never been inclusive.  At the moment, it is closer to being inclusive than it has ever been.  We have an African American president for example, for the first time in history.  And African Americans are playing various roles on staff and we have more African Americans in parish ministry as well.  We even have a few African Americans who've been teaching at the divinity schools that are Unitarian Universalists, Starr King for example on the west coast.  So there is more inclusivity than there has ever been with respect to the African American tradition.  And I re--this past month I retired officially from Unitarian, from the Unitarian Universalist Church.  I never was able to get settled in the traditional way.  What ended up happening was that I started a congregation, an intentionally diverse congregation.  It was the first such planter or seeder con--seeded con--congregation in the history of the church, with intentional diversity as its goal, or with diversity as its goal and inclusiveness as its goal.  We had some success in that and we succeeded for a time, but we also had many challenges and the church did not endure.  So it--I went up, I went up to retire officially from my ministry to the Unitarian Universalist denomination last month and discovered that that church no longer exists, but there are others.
Speaker 2: You actually left the church before they expired?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  I left after about three years and again finances was a key issue.
Story_ID: 168586
Speaker 1: So you, so they, they really couldn't afford a full time--
Speaker 2: No, we, we did not grow fast enough to be able to afford the full time minister.
Speaker 1: The, does you know the congregation actually pay the minister, or does the denomination pay the minister?
Speaker 2: In the case of the planter con--congregations, there's a combination.  Some money from--some start-up money from the denomination and the rest the congregation was expected to do as it grew.  I think one of the challenges for that particular congregation was the growth--for any congregation, any start-up congregation, growth is an issue.  A lot of the people who start with a small congregation--how can I say this--don't really have an interest in the growth.  They like the smallness, they like the intimacy of the small congregation.  And so they are reluctant to seek growth.  And so there's a kind of tension, always is this tension in any church, but this tension can prevent growth.  This tension can prevent growth and pre--and prevent continuity.  How can I say this?  Can--at some point it becomes counterproductive.  At some point you don't have enough energy feeding the congregation to be able to make it--to sustain it.  You don't have enough people to be on all the committees.  You don't have enough funding to pay, to pay all of the staff.  And the key items in any church are going to be your programs for children and youth, and your, and your program of Sunday ser--Sunday worship.  But there have to be these other programs to, to make the venture appeal to enough people so that you have a sustaining--a sustainable foundation.
Story_ID: 168587
Speaker 1: Now your tenure with the Unitarian [Unitarian Universalist denomination] highlights one of the biggest struggles and may--maybe one of the most difficult struggles in race relations in the United States, and that's around spirituality.  Sunday's been called the most segregated hour of the--Sunday at 11:00, church time, is the most segregated part of the week for most Americans, black people are in black churches or black mosques and white people are in white spiritual settings.  And it's--the struggle goes back to the days of abolitionists, people working for the same goal, but going back to separate places and, and to--why did you, why did you--did you find that hard?  Now see someone to create like an integrated spiritual setting in a--this is all--it seems like it's a real difficult thing to do.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I see, I see the direction you're moving in there.  Yes it was--well how can I put?  I think the issue for that congregation was that racial diversity was not so much an issue as other kinds of diversity.  Within the Unitarian Universalist denomination, the struggle for inclusiveness is broader than the struggle for racial in--inclusiveness.  It also includes gender, gender preference, and it also includes the economic diversity; the struggle between rich and poor.  Unitarian--
Speaker 1: Education.
Speaker 2: Educational levels.  I was going to say that Unitarianism traditionally has appealed to well educated, wealthy, white parishioners and, and it has its background in, in New England among, among its early members are John Quincy Adams and John Adams.  I should--the other way around, John Adams and his son John Quincy Adams.  So we've had a, a couple of presidents there who were Unitarian Universalists.  Many of the politicians attended All Souls Church in the 1800s.  Some of them attended All Souls church and supported slavery.  So it's--how can I say this?  So the, the issue of diversity within the church, yes--how can I--I got--I got a very diverse group.  But--racially diverse, yes.  But some of the tensions in terms of the--for example, African American cultural attitudes with respect to gender preference, same sex, same sex gender preference.  Sometimes that got into the way of, of creating a homogenous grouping, spiritual grouping.  You know that, that got in the way of our spirituality.  I'm not sure what the answer is there.  Certainly I changed and grew a lot as a result of having to pull those things together.  I wrote a, a meditation which is now in a book of 100 Favorite Meditations, 100 Meditations taken from the series of, of meditation books that we do every year.  One of those was done with meditations by African Americans exclusively and I have a meditation in that book called, 'Transcending Boundaries.'  That's a favorite because that's, that's the challenge of--I may be open with respect to racial diversity, but I have my challenges in other respects.  I'm not as tolerant as I might be with respect to education, for example.  I, I tend to be a snob intellectually.  And I expect a lot--for that reason I expect a lot of my students.  I expect them to, to reach out.  They don't have to know everything, but they have to be very, very open and, and that's what I try to teach more than anything else is openness and this hunger and thirsting after knowledge.
Story_ID: 168588
Speaker 1: But you're absolutely right.  The spiritual quest is, is challenging because we forget spirituality sometimes as we, as we seek to deal with these very immediate situations that we're in and the whole value system that we have.  The value system does not focus on spirituality, it focuses on science.  And until we begin to look a little bit more at the spiritual side of life, we're going to have problems in our culture and in our society with respect to mental illness, with respect to crime, with respect--and, and with respect to what I would call the sociological aspects of how we divide up the money.  How do we deal with issues like division of labor and making sure that there's a standard of living that, that no person needs to be below in our country.  How do we deal with that, and how do we get a value system that is consistent with a democratic vision, a vision of, of a country that is democratic?  How do we have a, how do we have a--how do we--how do we have a value system that supports that?  We don't at the moment.  If we were to have drought and when we have drought and when we have human--layoffs from jobs, there's nothing in place to really allow us to support one another through those periods of crisis.  In another kind of society, that's in place.  No person is left behind.  You don't have a lot of need for an old folks' home.  So what we have now in, in Africa with respect to HIV and AIDS is really devastating on a number of levels because suddenly all the old people in the community find themselves as caregivers for the orphaned children as the AIDS crisis spreads.  And how is it spreading?  It's spreading to the extent that a third of some countries, up to a third of some countries, is inflicted with the virus.  And most of the workforce--let me put it this way.  The affected people are in the work--are mostly people who are in the workforce.  So you've got all of these implications for development, for human and economic development related to the HIV/AIDS crisis, yet a very different way of responding to that crisis, you know, because of the fact that African sociological structures are in place so that there is this sense of inter-relatedness and relationship is a key and central value within the community.  Not only your relationship with your god, but your relationship to your fellow human beings and your need to take care of family and kin, and extended family and extended kinship lines.  Those things have worked to assist in our survival, both on that side of the ocean with respect to the AIDS crisis, and, and in terms of Diaspora.  When we came here, we could survive.  We could survive being separated from our children because of some of the values of extended family that made it possible for us to then incorporate and embody people into our lives as part of our family system and network and feel a sense of obligation and caring for them.  But that's not present in a general way in American society.
Story_ID: 168589
Speaker 1: Take me back to the one we were on (laughter), the question you had just asked me--
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: --so that we can start (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --I was just asking you about what the-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: The challenge of, of an African spirituality and trying to communicate that to a, a non-African--to a group of people who didn't understand that spirituality, okay, okay.  You can start up again.
Speaker 2: He started.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yes it was a challenge.  I think that that is part of the challenge and I guess it's a part of the challenge for me in terms of, of bringing my own spiritual perspective or as I have evolved in my own spiritual growth and understanding of the divine and of, of God and the nature of God.  That doesn't always fit with what I understand Africa, African vision of God to be as well.  But at the same time, I guess there's part of what I see as a vision of God in Africa goes, takes, takes me back to my childhood with my grandmother and things that I saw with her.  For example, and, and it helps me to understand Jesus better too; it gives me an understanding of Jesus.  So what has--what happened to me as a result of the contact with Africa was that I experienced being in a place and hearing someone speak in another language, knowing that I was hearing another language but hearing in my head the words that they had said in English and knowing intuitively what they were saying to me.  As in the day of the Pentecost when everyone was speaking in their own language and understanding in another lang--in the language of the, of the speaker.  That--I, I, I could understand that kind of accord.  I don't know if I can understand it scientifically.  That is to say I think that eventually we're gonna come to a place where we understand the kind of openness that occurs so that people can communicate without necessarily using the same words, or even without words at all.  People do communicate without words.  But thought-to-thought.  And that thought is in whatever language they know, including the language of pictures.  I think that's going to come about, but at, at the point of trying to lead a congregation if you will, from this place where I was standing at the time, it was challenging.  And part of it, part of the challenges that the sands keep shifting.  The, the sands are shifting under your feet as you speak.  So how are you gonna teach someone when you're standing on this ground and it's, it's not--first of all it's not familiar to you, and secondly, it's never the same.  I think that's part of the challenge of being a Unitarian Universalist minister and that's part of what I meant when I said sometime back I am radically Unitarian and radically Universalist.  Because I believe everybody will--has--is the possibility of being embraced by whatever this thing that is the whole is, this, this divine whole.  We all are embraced in it.
Story_ID: 168590
Speaker 1: By the same token, how do you feel about the--now most commercially successful churches in terms of populations would be mega churches.  The huge congregations of people well dressed, driving shining cars up to a huge cathedral and crystal cathedral like Robert Schuller or like something that Reverend Ike [Frederick J. Eikerenkoetter II] has or Prophet Jones [James Francis Marion Jones] or some--you know and Creflo Dollar, all these people.  I mean how do you feel about these, these big--they, they have, they have television (unclear) and a huge networks and everything.  How do you feel about these mega churches?
Speaker 2: Well to the extent that mega churches are successful, many times they, they function with small groups within the, within the mega body and they come together, they come together as mega bodies once in a while, or once a week maybe, but it's a different mega body every time too.  At the same time the actual church functioning goes on in small groups or clusters of ten or fifteen or twenty people.  I think I, I recognize that and, and I think--and I recognize too that success in America is often defined by the material aspects of (unclear).  How much money do you have?  Even within the Unitarian church, my success as a church is determined by how many people, the numbers of people that are coming into the church.  It's determined by how much money the church is bringing in.  If I had that criteria for success, I would be saddled with a, a mega dose of depression because I wouldn't be able to meet it.  I guess being--one of the advantages of being black in America is that you learn to understand who you are in terms that are nonmaterial.  That you try to get at the essence of things.  And so when you're judging others and when you're judging yourself.  And so I've never thought that I was anything but a marvelous, wonderful human being.  But I recognize, in saying that I recognize that Jesus was not rich, Jesus did not have money.  He had a lot of followers, but he didn't have a mega church.  He moved around from place to place and people followed him because they saw in him a light.  They recognized in him something that they wanted to see in themselves.  They followed him because he was a whole person and they felt the possibilities for being whole in looking at him and in looking at his life, and in touching the hem of his garment.  Now again, the study of African culture has helped me to see things like--to see in, in African worldview and in African culture, some of the things that Jesus did and some of the things that he stood for.  I mentioned the experience with speaking tongues.  Every community in Africa has a translator.  The person who translates for the king because the king cannot speak directly to someone outside of his cultural, outside of his community, not directly; speaks through the interpreter.  And I think I understand that.  It has to do with the spirituality.  It has to do with the spirituality that says if I allow this person to see who I really am, they can take advantage of me.  They can know who--they can know things that they, that I--that may not be in my advantage for them to know.
Speaker 1: One could argue that they can also relate to him too.
Speaker 2: Well yes.  But the Europeans didn't come, didn't come to Africa to relate to the Africans unfortunately.
Speaker 1: No I'm talking Africans in terms of each other, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes that's--
Speaker 1: Be able to--not be able to speak to your leader directly may be not the best policy, you know.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that it's true that the Africans cannot speak to their own leader directly; that wasn't the case.  This was for--although there are some cultures where that is the case.
Speaker 1: In Wolof they have like a person who interprets.  You speak to him and he--
Speaker 2: And he tells it, yeah exactly, exactly, exactly.  But it has--it does have to do with openness and your right to raise the issue of transparency, what does this mean?  I think I don't--I think the chiefs do, they speak with the elders, they speak with one another.  But certainly not to a stranger, certainly not to a stranger.  And I have, I have some thoughts on that.  Now I've lost track of the question, however (laughter).

Speaker 1: We were talking about the mega churches.
Speaker 2: The mega churches and, and the--as I said Jesus, Jesus had, Jesus had a mega church at the same time.  And part of that was his ability to, to empathize with others and to reach out in a way that was healing for them as they sought to be strengthened in, in--within themselves.  And I think that many of the mega churches have this kind of reminder or they have this healing ministry or this healing outreach, the ones that are successful.  They either heal memories or try to heal experiences as in the case of [Robert] Schulller, the power of positive thinking.  That's one mode.  Or they literally reach out and touch the people around them and say lift up your (unclear) and walk.  In my own--well in--yes that too, lay--use the hand to lay somebody out on the floor.  And I've done that too, although I didn't understand what it--what was happening when I did that.  When I touched someone and they've fallen out; didn't understand precisely what was happening.  But I much--I'm much more comfortable if you will, with the touch that brings healing, with reaching out to someone and saying you don't feel well today, would you mind if I pray with you?  And reaching out and holding that person's hand and sometimes I pray even without words to open up whatever channels are there so that a healing does occur.  And my grandmother had that as a gift of God, I presume as a gift of God.  But she was able to reach out in that way because of her background as an African person and because of her understanding of that aspect of culture which makes it possible for you to empathize in the way that Jesus did and, and open up this healing channel.  And so from her I learned to do this and it isn't something I try to do, but on occasion I'm led to do that.  I'm led to, have been led to, to circumstances where that happened.  I remember once I had a, a car problem and the mechanic was having a hard time getting to my car and I finally figured out that the reason for that was that the mechanic needed some healing.  When I made up my mind to offer the healing outreach, the car got fixed, miraculously the car was fixed.

Speaker 1: I think in terms of Africa, we don't always understand even what we see.  I like what you say about inform--the need to inform--the ritual for example with libation.  What does libation mean?  What about cannibalism?  We talk about cannibalism as something negative, but we really don't understand cannibalism for example.  I, I like to use the example of cannibalism because we talk about the Congo [Democratic Republic of the Congo] in the heart of Africa, it was a cannibalistic areas, there were pockets of cannibalism there.  Well the is--the, the image that we have of cannibalism is this missionary being boiled in a pot and chewed up as part of an evening meal.  That's far, far, far from the real meaning of cannibalism.  The real meaning of cannibalism is that it's an affirmation of life that says if you have a fight with someone that results in that person's death, as in, as in communities at war for territory and so forth, and you kill somebody in that, at the end of that you have to acknowledge the bravery, the victor has to acknowledge the bravery of those who fell in pursuit of their--in defense of their, of their position.  And in acknowledging that bravery, you ceremonially consume a portion of that person's body.  Whatever that portion is that, that represents what you admire.  If it's courage, I don't know whether courage is in the heart or in the liver, but whatever that is, then you eat the part that, that relates to courage.  If it's faithfulness to loved ones, then you consume the part that, that represents that which, which you are in awe of.  And that's the whole basis for the--that's originally the whole basis for the communion rituals that are part of the, of the Christian church.
Speaker 2: This is my body, this is my blood.
Speaker 1: This is my body, this is my blood.  And in the Catholic tradition at one time, I don't know that this is still the case, but at one time the prayers theoretically transformed the wine and the bread into the real body and the real blood so that you have this reality of the, of the, the focus of cannibalism that you are participating in the, the purity of, of, of Jesus by really consuming this body and this blood, which is the basic meaning of the ritual of cannibalism, the rituals of cannibalism.
Story_ID: 168593
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well with respect to hopes, I'm hopeful that we can begin to put our experience, put the light of, of the intellectual sunshine if you will, on that experience and begin to appreciate and value it in terms of the role that, that African people played in developing the wealth of this country in terms of the role that African people played even in the very revolution of--against Great Britain, for example.  I'm hopeful that we will learn enough about the experience and love it and love ourselves enough to move to another level of empowerment as full and equal partners in, in the American dream because certainly we are the--we are the keepers of the dream; we have always been the keepers of the dream for others.  And it's time that we experienced the fruits of that dream for ourselves as well, and our progeny.  That's my hope.  Part of that hope is that--and part of the concern--we have a lot of mental illness in the African American community that I believe is born out of some of the frustrations of the experience, it's born out of the denials, the coll--I, I say denial, collective denial of, of our role.  It's born out of the frustration of being the last to be hired and the first to be fired.  It's born out of the frustration of having to grow up in a--without a--without necessarily having a father or being separated either from a father or a mother for one reason or another.  There's a lot of pathology within the black community, and I'm hopeful that this transformation that I see in terms of understanding who we are and lifting--and learning to love ourselves better will also make a difference in terms of what we see in the way of mental illness and pathology, communal pathologies like high crime rates and, and so forth.  I'm hopeful, I'm hopeful of--those are, those are the things I want to see ended.  I wanna see profiling ended because I think to some extent we create criminals through the, through the very act of profiling and the expectation that we're, that we're teaching people to become criminals.  You know in other words, if we go into the inner city and we have teachers going into the inner city to teach, and I think that they see themselves as being in a setting where they're teaching people who are going to become criminals.  Well that's gonna be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  So as we begin to value and appreciate ourselves more, and as we begin to stand up for who we are to the extent that those around us also value and appreciate who we are, then we can begin to make a difference and have a different kind of society, one that is closer to this ideal vision that, that, that I have of, of diversity, of people working together to create a world that is harmonious and plentiful; this is a plentiful world.  There is no reason for the, the lack that we have among certain populations.  It doesn't make sense because it doesn't have to be that way.  It's that way because we don't have a vision of its being otherwise.

Speaker 1: You're currently teaching?
Speaker 2: I'm currently teaching African American studies at Prince George's Community College [Largo, Maryland], which is in the county that I live.
Speaker 1: Now you, now you had such a rich life of experiences, what would you consider at this stage, and you're, you're still young enough to do a lot more.  What would you consider at this stage as your legacy?
Speaker 2: As my legacy.  I guess I'm too young to be thinking about legacy at this point.  What have I--but it-but in point of fact, I guess I have to look at this question, what am I leaving behind?  Certainly Bolinga Center [Bolinga Black Cultural Resources Center at Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio] is an important part of what I leave behind.  This place on, on a college campus where, where people can gather and learn about African studies.  Where they can also communicate and share and grow and develop as human beings.  I really like the idea of the center and the center is an important part of my legacy.  I--in going to the retirement, my own official retirement for Univers--Unitarian Universalism the other day, I recognized that I had left a legacy within the Unitarian Universalist denomination that I was not really aware of until this past month, until that moment.  And that legacy seems to be willingness to, willingness to create, to, to do something new, to--and to take risks.  But it's a legacy that says that the way to salvation is through inclusion and not exclusion.  And so I think I leave that legacy for the Unitarian Universalists as well and, and wherever I've been, this legacy that says that the world is a better place when there is harmony, and that growth is related somehow to diversity and to harmony, to harmony with diversity, rather.  Not to harmony because there's no difference of opinion.  I think if I leave a legacy, it's a legacy that there can be dialogue, meaningful dialogue without disruption.  That there can be difference without warfare.  I think that [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. was onto something when he talked about nonviolence; that that's very much consistent with the concept of dialogue.  And I think that for America today and for Africa today we're going to have to really work to make dialogue the modality or the modus operandi, or we're going to end up not having a legacy to leave for anyone.  We're going to end up killing ourselves and one another.

Speaker 1: How do you view oral history as a project?
Speaker 2: I'm glad you asked that question.  I'm so excited about The HistoryMakers project for that reason.  Part of the study of Africa has taught me that African people do not trust the written word, they trust the spoken word for a number of reasons, one of them being that you can, you can interpret the spoken word a lot more easily than you can the word on the page because there's so many, there's so many opportunities for divergence between the cold, sterile page for--you can same the same sentence in three different ways and have three different sentences.  You know, I'm fine.  I am fine.  You know there's just, there's so many different interpretations just by where you put the, the emphasis in a sentence.  So the, the, the spoken word is much more trusted in that context.  The other thing is that in terms of academia, we haven't always acknowledged the importance of oral history and we say that that can't be documented.  Well we're discovering that the oral tradition can be documented and we can go back and look up the facts and verify information and confirm more, or discover the divergences.  But I think that, especially in the African American tradition, because the material was left out of the textbooks for so long, sometimes the only access we have to it is through the oral tradition.  And that tradition can take us back a very long way.

Speaker 1: Now this is the last question.  This is slightly different from legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered? (Laughter) I think I'd like to be remembered as someone who was creative.  Someone who wasn't afraid to start something new; to try something new.  I'd like to be remembered as someone who cared about people, cared about other people.  And someone who felt that the people I cared about could do anything they put their minds to, and I care about everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay thank you.
Story_ID: 168597
Speaker 1: All right, this is a picture of myself with my two sons.  It was taken around the early 1980s, shortly after I was ordained into the ministry.
Speaker 2: This is a picture that goes back to my childhood.  That's myself with my mother [Beatrice Reed], I don't know who the little boy is in the background.  We were at a place called Coltons Point, Maryland, which was a popular beach resort for African--for the African American community.  I think the house in the background was Harry Golden's place which he--which had a lot of rooms in it and there were also little separate units on the grounds for vacationers.
Speaker 1: That picture goes back to my graduation from Allegheny College [Meadsville, Pennsylvania] and that would have been taken at graduation in 1959.
Speaker 2: This picture was taken when I was about three years old.  I didn't notice until recently how much it looks like a picture of my daughter taken when she was three years old and her daughter when she was less, a little less than three years old.  So somewhere between the age of two and three.  This picture was taken in front of my grandmother's home at 1509, the figure 8th Street, Northwest in the District of Columbia [Washington D.C.]
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my daughter with my father, George Reed.  So there--father--grand--three generations I guess represented there.  My father and my--with his granddaughter, my daughter, and she's about--I guess she's about three years old in that picture.  The picture was taken, I should say that picture was taken in Ohio when my dad visited the family when we were living in Ohio at Wilberforce.  So--
Speaker 2: That picture was taken much more recently.  It's a picture of my father about a year and a half ago at a celebration of black history month at the D.C. public schools headquarters.  He was being given an award on that occasion for his, I guess for his role in the D.C. public schools.  He was the first African American, and perhaps the first blind person to be mainstreamed into the D.C. public schools.  He graduated from Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School] in 1933.  So this was, this award came in 1990--maybe it was late, no, it was more like 2001, so a century later, or in the next century I should say.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of a family gathering in New York.  My father and mother [Beatrice Reed], my--one of my sons, a cousin and my aunt were gathered there for a special opening night activity for my son.  I think the occasion was, 'Half Baked.' 'Half Baked,' I'm not going to say any more about it.
Speaker 2: Okay. All right, starting from the left, my father is in the background.  In front of him is my mother, Beatrice Reed.  Behind her is my son David [Dave Chappelle].  Next to my son is my cousin Cecil Tucker, Jr [ph.].  I'm in front of my cousin and next to me on the right, on the far right is my aunt Marie Jackson [ph.].
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my daughter when she was about the age that I was, I take it back.  That's a picture of my granddaughter when she was about the age that I was in that earlier picture and that my daughter was in one of the pictures you've seen of her.  Again, you can see by the confusion that I had that, that we all looked very much alike at that age.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me with my mother.  I--on the occasion of the opening of the, 'Nutty Professor,' in California.  We were on the way to the red carpet event.
Speaker 1: He was, he was in character.  This is my daughter, let's see, which one of us is this?  This is my daughter, Felicia.  And she was at about a year and a half, two years.  Again, that picture looks, she look--in that picture she looks so much like her daughter in the picture you saw a minute ago.  And me in the picture in front of my grandmother's house.
Speaker 2: This picture is very important to me and to our family.  This is a picture that my mother took and aunt took together as they were leaving Barbados in the British West Indies to come here.  This would have been in about 1933.
Speaker 1: My aunt is standing, and she's standing on the left.  And my mother is seated in the chair.
Speaker 2: I don't know everyone in this picture.  I don't rec--yes I, I do.  I recognize two of the three at any rate.  Seated is Governor Evans [Melvin H. Evans] of the Virgin Islands.  He's now deceased.  Next to him is Randall Robinson.
Speaker 1: Trans Africa.
Speaker 2: Of Trans Africa, former president of Trans Africa and founder of Trans Africa.  And the third person I think--I, I'm not sure who it is.  The person on the right is my mother, who at that time was president of the Caribbean American Intercultural Organization.  And she is in the process of handing out awards at their annual event honoring independence of the African nations, some of which became inde--many of which became independent in the month of August.
Speaker 1: This picture is a--another picture from my mother's days in the Caribbean American Intercultural Organization.  She is the person second from the right on the front row.  I think I recognize also the wife of the Ambassador of Jamaica standing directly behind her, Mrs.--I can't remember her name.  She was a model and her married name is Johnson, Mrs. Keith Johnson.  But she was, she was titled.  She was a Lady in the British it--with a British title.  I don't remember her name.
Speaker 2: Pardon? The year that it would have been.  That would have been--that would have been in the 1980s.
Speaker 1: This would have been in 1981, the month of November at my ordination.  And there was a reception immediately after the ordination.  This is a group of women from the Negro Business and Professional Women's Club I think, that were gathered around me at, after the actual ordination.  These women were supporting me from that org--from that group.  I belong to a number of organizations and groups and the National Association of, of Negro Business and Professional Women's Clubs is one of them.
Speaker 2: This is a picture with C. Payne Lucas, the founder of Africare on the occasion of my retirement from the board after twenty-three years.  I've since--I was rotated off the board as part of the transition from--the, the leadership transition of the organization.  We now have a new president, but--and for continuity, some of those who had retired have, have been recalled into service, and I'm now serving as vice president of the organization.
Speaker 1: A picture with Eddie Murphy and my mother and, and I at the--again at the opening of the film, 'Nutty Professor.'
Speaker 2: That was, I'm sorry I should say that was in Universal City in Hollywood.
Speaker 1: This is a picture that appeared in the UU World [magazine].  It's one that--you asked about legacy.  I think the trees, the tree projects and some of the projects I was involved in through Africare, not one of them.  But I traveled to Africa, and this is a picture of me and Lucy Connor [ph.] in a health center in a little village in Dakar Senegal, near Dakar and Senegal.  The village had just gotten a, what do you call it, a ceramic, a ceramic pot with a faucet attached to it.  And you see the, the little girl washing her hands using the faucet.  That was an important development there.  It seems like such a simple device to put a faucet and attach it to the water vessel to make it--instead of dipping your hand into the pot.  But one of the things I noticed in, in that part--
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my father, the concert pianist.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my father, the concert pianist.  As a very young man, he would go around the area doing, doing piano concerts.  And he often played with a friend of his, Alfonso Butler [ph.] who played the violin.  I'm not sure if this was one of those concerts, but he and my mother met at a concert very much like this when my mother was trying to get him to agree to play for a Y, YWCA function here in the city; that was how they met.  So this picture has a, a lot of meaning for a number of reasons, including that, that memory.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me when I was about four or five years old.  And I, I included it in part because it looks--there's so much of a family resemblance in the three generations, myself, my daughter and my granddaughter.
