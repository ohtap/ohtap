Speaker 1: Okay.  When was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Tamo, T-A-M-O, Arkansas, and moved with the family, she was born in 1921, and moved with the family in 1928, to, no it was even before then, so it was '21 [1921], so I guess it was '26 [1926], they moved to Alton, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Do you know why they moved there?
Speaker 2: F-for work.  It was, it was better work and at some point I'll get into the details--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --Of how the whole family moved.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: But it, it, it is also a migratory route for southerners at, in the Mississippi Valley, or, or, it--that--of states that bordered--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --the Mississippi River, they would move up the river for work and you know, St. Louis [Missouri] was a stopping off point, Alton [Illinois], is twenty-five miles across the rivers of the Missouri and Illinois and, and Mississippi River is from St. Louis, so it's on the banks of the Mississippi, and so that's the stopping off point as was Chicago [Illinois], Detroit [Michigan] or Windsor, Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay, how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: I just talked to my mother on my way here.  My mother is a very strong woman, very reserved, determined, very resourceful.  Loving mother, refined woman, and a God-fearing woman, a Christian woman, a woman with a great sense of humor but it, but it's, it's contained.  So, and, and probably one of my best friends.
Speaker 1: Oh, how lovely.
Story_ID: 137157
Speaker 1: Did she [Clementine Nolan] ever tell you any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh many stories.
Speaker 1: Could you share one with us?
Speaker 2: About her growing up, it, I guess it was about her and her cousin, my mother is one of six children, three of which are still alive, my mother's now eighty-six years old, eighty-five years old, will be eighty-six years old on December 26th, and she had three other sisters and two brothers.  One brother is deceased, and two sisters are deceased.  So, it's now, she's now the oldest, the oldest sister died about three years ago and sh--my aunt who remains is seventy-five, and so they were like, they called themselves, the three that remain, my oldest aunt who just died three years ago and the aunt who remains, they call themselves the golden girls, plus their first cousin, whose been deceased for probably fifteen years.  But it was the story about this first cousin that she--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: --Her name was Zenobia [ph.], she, her, her mother Josephine [ph.] was my grandfather, my maternal grandfather, Thomas Nolan's sister.  So that made my mother and Zenobia, first cousins, they called Zenobia "Z." And Aunt Z and my mother were good friends but Zenobia was always into something and she would use my mother as the verifier of, of the story that she was telling because no one believed her because she always told lies and, but they believed my mother, so they were sort of a team because my mother was, you know, no one would suspect her of doing these things.  And I guess the one story she told me about them, they had, they had gotten into poison ivy and they, it was on a dare, they dared each other and so they did it and obviously they got poison ivy and, and, and, strangely enough, I remembered that story and so when I was in the, I think I was in the fourth or fifth grade, I, I had the same dare with my buddy across the street, rubbed it all on my face, he did it, he was not very allergic to it, I was extraordinarily allergic and almost died.  My face had swollen double or triple, it was, my face was so swollen, I had to hold it up like this to walk around.  I had no chin, ears had just kinda blown out and, and, so people would come by the house, walk by the sidewalk and I was standing in the window so they could see m--see this image of this crazy kid who had done this, so that's one of the stories. And my mother told me lots of stories about her father and her, how, or what a provider he was, she was a father's girl, a daddy's girl and, and loved her mother to death too.  And, and my great-grandmother, who I knew.
Speaker 1: Oh?
Speaker 2: 'Cause they--it was an extended family, my great-gran, my great-grandmother and great-grandfather who I didn't know, they all lived in the house, with my grandparents and prior to my parents buying a home, we lived there.  My father [Albert Wagner] was in the military, he had gone to the war and my mother and I lived there and I lived there until I was three years old.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And then they bought the home and were out of the house.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us your great-grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Doc Nolan, Sr. [ph.] and Emily Nolan [ph.].
Story_ID: 137158
Speaker 1: And they [Doc Nolan, Sr. (ph.) and Emily Nolan (ph.)] were from Arkansas too.  They were, they were from a suburb or rural area of Pine Bluff [Arkansas], and the, you know, they all met in Pine Bluff, so Doc was my great-grandfather, was part English and his mother was a slave and my great-grandmother Emily, was a very, she was al--she was like a Puritan, that's what she reminded me of.  And I, I remember my great-grandmother, I can, I can remember my, 'cause she lived downstairs and they had a little kitchen down there and I could remember my walking round behind her and she would drink postum, which was a substitute for coffee, I guess, and she would say, "Boy you want some of this postum," and (laughter) of course, you know, and she, you know, she would, she was always stern but was just, in retrospect, in talking to my mother [Clementine Nolan], and to some of my aunts and uncles, just loving every minute of this kid tagging along with her and she loved my Uncle Tommy whose the remaining uncle that's left.  She just absolutely adored him, and she would, her favorite food as I recall was, was mutton, as she called it, "You want some of this mutton chop boy," and she, that's where I got introduced to what we called it brown bread.  She always, she, and, and, you know, as I think about it, she ate very health--healthful, because she never eat white bread, it was always brown bread as we called it then, so it was wheat bread and she didn't eat pork very much although our family did, does, she, I never remembered her eating it and I don't know, I didn't ask anybody did she?  But she always was eating lamb, that's what I remember, that's where I learned about that and she would eat fish.  So, I remember she had a gold tooth right here in the front, always read her bible every day. And the story about my great-grandfather, Doc was, he, he was, my family is very instrumental in our home church in Illinois, in Alton, I was just talking to my mother this morning about the church's seventy-ninth church anniversary was Sunday, and my great-grandfather was a deacon there, his son, James William, was a deacon, started the Sunday School, in the church and the choir, my Aunt Millie, who, another child, was very involved there, was the founder of the gospel chorus in our church, was a great Sunday school teacher.  My mother was president of the Missions Society of our church. And I was just talking to her, she, she, it was this big joke on me, it, so an announcement had been made in the church that someone was gonna donate cushions for all of the pews in our church, our church was, at home was quite large and so the  person who made the announcement, I said, oh he's the one who's doing this because, you know, he's, this guy is, he's a millionaire so, so, I just said well, this, this is who's doing it and he just doesn't want anybody to know it.  So, we had been talking about this, and I was telling my mother this, 'cause I talk to my mother every Saturday, for sure wherever I am in the world, but and a lot of times during the week, like today, so we're saying well, you know, this is the guy who did it, he's just trying to be coy about it so, (laughter) my mother told me this Saturday, we were in New York, my wife [Bennetta Mitchell Wagner] and I and I called my mother Saturday, and so we were talking about the cushions, she said, well, she said I've had so much fun with your thinking you're knowing who did, she's the one that donated the cushions for the church and for all of the pews in our church at home.  And so I, she said, well I said, "Well then why didn't you tell me?"  She said, "Well, I thought I had told you I wanted to do it and you told me not to, you didn't want me to."  I said, "No, I said I never would have told you that, I said I thought it was great."  We had talked about another financial matter in the church and I said well, I don't think you should do that, but she had miss--she had forgotten what we had talked about 'cause she, she doesn't remember things quite as much as she used to, but she's still pretty sharp, she was sharp enough to fool me with this.  So, that's a diversion but it's, it's, it's an indication of how involved we are, or have been--are with our church and, and as you will see as we continue discussing, having this discussion, what a huge role it's played in my life.
Story_ID: 137159
Speaker 1: Back to your mother [Clementine Nolan], did she work outside the home?
Speaker 2: My mother did domestic work.  And for wealthy people in an area called Fairmount [Illinois] and you know, she cleaned and, and ironed for folks and then she got a job, my moth--my mother had, had started college and dropped out because she became very ill and, and you know, she recovered obviously, but she never went back and so she, she didn't finish school, she, she's (unclear) of college and actually taught nursery school for, for a few years and then when my father [Albert Wagner] returned from the military they divorced, I was ten when this occurred so it was in 1952, '53 [1953], and she had to provide for two kids, I have a sister who's four years younger than I am and we had a house that she kept and it wasn't paid for but she paid for it and that's how she paid for it and then she got a job with the Alton Mental Health Facility which was a state hospital as a psychiatric aid and that's where she retired from and, yes so she did work outside the home.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 137160
Speaker 1: You mentioned your father.  Could you tell us about him?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: My father is deceased, he died about five years ago and his name is Albert Irving Wagner, I-R-V-I-N-G, and he was born and raised in Glencoe, Missouri, and, which is not that extraordinarily far from Alton [Illinois], and he met my mother [Clementine Nolan] through church.  He had, he had moved to Alton, and he was going to church, singing in the choir and that's how he met my mother, he started dating my mother and he, he was drafted into the military in World War II, and was in the European theater of the war and was stationed in Italy and spent some time in Germany, and when he came out he was a very different person.
Speaker 1: What was, excuse me, what was he, his role in this during the war, was he a soldier, was he a support--
Speaker 2: He was a soldier, you know, he's, he was with the infantry and so when he came home he got employment, got a good job at the Laclede Steel Mill [later Alton Steel], if you can call that a good job for, for, for folks who didn't have a former education for men and women, there were a number of women who, who worked there as well, it was good money then, good benefits and that's where he worked.  He and my mother divorced as I said, probably in '52 [1952], and he remained in Alton and she remained in Alton, he started a whole new family with five other children and it was interesting.  We lived in Alton, and so by this tim--by the time he got married, he, he remarried, I guess I was in high school and headed for college, didn't know this other family hardly at all, new some of the, I knew a couple of my half-brothers, but didn't know them well and there was no really adversarial relationship, there was just no relationship, reached out to my father to keep some ties there and after I was drafted in, in the middle college, actually I dropped out of college a couple quarters, they caught me when I was out and, and so I drafted and by that time that he had gotten married and it always bothered me that it didn't appear that he had, well it wa--it didn't not just appear, it was true, he didn't really give the attention to my sister and me that I thought he should.  But on the other hand, I still knew he was my father and I wanted that relationship so I worked on it myself and what's interesting me, when I came home from Vietnam [War], I had went by his house one day and there on his bedroom wall were all these write-ups about me that had occurred in the newspaper, things that I had done when I was in college, things I had done when I was in Vietnam, he had all these write-ups so I had said to myself, well self, he really does love you, he just doesn't know how to express it.  So I made it a point that it--I concluded he didn't know how and I also concluded it was important that I kept a good relationship with him.
Story_ID: 137161
Speaker 1: So I reached out to him [Albert Irving Wagner], I would remember him on, you know, Father's Day and his birthday and I, you know it was important that he learned, that he knew who his grandkids were and my sister, because she's younger than I am, she didn't have as close an attachment with him as I did, plus he had ticked her off once in that he had promised to get her a pair of shoes for her ninth grade graduation and he didn't and she never forgot it.  I'd say, "Come on Barbara, you gotta get over this and he needs to know your kids." And so I would make sure that we would, he was a great fisherman and he was a great swimmer, he, he would, he would get off, he would dive off of pilings on the Mississippi River and swim to to shore.  He, he was, he was, he was an extraordinarily strong swimmer and he was a hunter and so I would, when I'd go al--to Alton, we would, I would organize these fishing trips with him and his grandsons and sometimes my, one of my ha--Reggie or one of my other half-brothers might tag along, it's usually Reginald, would, would come, 'cause he was one of the older ones. And so it, it was a way of bonding and keeping that together.  I brought him out here so that he could see my accomplishments, to see where I lived and just to be here with me and, you know, I took him to Mount Tamalpais [San Francisco, California] I'm, I'm an avid hiker and so by the time he died and he was ill, he had returned to the church, he had, he was ordained as a deacon. And what was extraordinary to me, the Sunday he ordained, was ordained, I had been asked by the pastor who's now deceased, he di--he de--he died this past January, but he asked me would I be the ordination speaker, so here I am the, the speaker for my father, because I had been, I had been a deacon in our church for almost thirty years here at Third Baptist, which is the oldest African American church west of the Rockies [Rocky Mountains], we celebrated our 153rd year this year.  But anyway, I, I, I'm back there and, and they were ordaining their first woman deacon, so I'm the speaker and so it was, it, it was just a very special moment with me and my father.
Story_ID: 137162
Speaker 1: And so, when he [Albert Irving Wagner] was dying, my half-brother called me and told me, you know, 'cause I had been home to see him and he said, well you know, it's really close now and, and they called and said he's died, but I had my good time with him about a week before and so when the funeral preparation and all that stuff, I, I said look, you guys, are the, the persons that he's lived with and really you should be making these arrangements, I said, but my, by my being the oldest child, I probably know more about his background than any of you and about his sisters and all of that and I said, which wasn't nearly as much as I knew about my maternal side, I said but I probably know ab--more about it and I said, why don't you let me draft an obituary and you cannot use any of it, you can edit it, you can throw it away, I said, but it's a start and they said okay.  So, I faxed it to them and they didn't change a word.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then for the order of service I said, now none of you go to church as far as I know, (laughter) I said, but he did and I said there is a, you know there's an order of worship that you follow and I said, let--why don't you let me just, just sketch out a, a program and they didn't change anything.--
Speaker 2: Oh, (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --So, then at the committal service--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --at the cemetery, because he was a veteran, of course they had a flag and you know, they give it to the widow, well his wid--his wife had, had, was deceased, his second wife, so they gave it to one of the kids and what really got me, what really did me in was, they brought the flag over and gave it to me.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's lovely.
Speaker 1: So, it was just a, it was just a wonderful, 'cause you know, even in families and I see it so much now that our blood, I mean tot--a hundred percent blood brothers and sisters at f--at funeral times can be very acrimonious, there was not a idle word or, or anything that occurred with all of this.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's wonderful.
Speaker 1: So, I really thought it was amazing that that had happened so--
Speaker 2: Yes, you should be blessed.
Speaker 1: --Yes.
Speaker 2: It's wonderful.
Story_ID: 137163
Speaker 1: Did you know anything about his [Albert Irving Wagner] background, did he ever tell you about his growing up, his childhood?
Speaker 2: His father owned a huge amount, excuse me, huge amount of property--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --And, I mean, hundreds of acres in Missouri, and it was absconded with, you know, they, they lost it, and I, I forgot how this happened but it, it did, it was, that he, he was so, yeah, I would pick out, you know, I would make sure I would get information about the family from him.
Story_ID: 137164
Speaker 1: Talking about my father's [Albert Irving Wagner] background and his upbringing, there were nine of them, two boys, Edward who was older than my father and lived in Cleveland [Ohio] most of his adult life and seven sisters, and that's who, you know, was--lived in Glencoe [Illinois] and my, my f--great, well my grandfather, my paternal grandfather Albert and Pearl, and I remember going over to their home, I just vaguely remember this, I was very young 'cause they died when I was very young and visiting my great-grandparents he, he ended up being blind and, and I don't know what it was from, I don't know if it was from diabetes, or from what, but I just vaguely remember that and my grandmother would come over here periodically and I remember a necklace that she'd given my mother [Clementine Nolan], I, I remember then, it just flashed in my mind, she, she, was a slight built lady, very kind, very sweet, I recall that, but that's all because we would, we, we didn't have a car and transportation getting over there, back and forth there was, was difficult so public transportation isn't what it is today, but that's what I remember.  I do remember some of my aunts very well, my Aunt Gladys [ph.], and my mother and father and she had two children, children, Riley [ph.] and, oh what is the, as the older I get the, the more I forget, but is, she had two children, about my age and my sisters age so we, we saw each other a lot and my, my Aunt Bernadine [ph.] who's just a sweetie pie , loved my mother a lot and then his younger sister Pearl, I remember them, oh and my aunt Ethel, who was, who was really like a little poet, I mean she wrote lots of poetry and I had some, wrote, wrote songs for music and I don't think she ever became commercial but she did, and it was, it was good stuff and probably if I looked hard enough, I'd probably have some stuff that I got from her.  So that's what I remember about my paternal side, flip side though, flip it over for my maternal side on my grandmother's side, I, it's probably where I know the most of our history, I'll wait until you ask me--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --About that.
Speaker 2: Okay, well that'll all come together--
Story_ID: 137165
Speaker 1: What was your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Earliest memory of growing up was on Gross Street, 1929 Gross Street, where I was born [Alton, Illinois].  I was born there, of course I don't remember being born, but I remember the house and where we lived, we lived upstairs and this was for three years before we bought our house, our parents [Albert Irving Wagner and Clementine Nolan], my parents bought the house wh--where I spent most of my growing up years but it was great being there with my grandparents, they it was, it was a corner lot house and this huge, huge elm tree in the front yard and I, what I remember, and my grandfather, now I told you about how devoted all the members and his siblings were to our church, well he didn't, he didn't go to church and it wasn't because he wasn't a good man, was because when he first attempted to unite with the church, his moth--his mother told him he wasn't ready.  So, it, there was a thing about Southerners and it's very interesting about what the religious experience should be, probably has a lot to do with some of the slave background, but they felt you should have an extraordinary, a religious experience before you were bona fide Christian.  There was the whole issue of the mourners' bench where you would go, you'd go to revivals and you would sit at the, the unsaved would sit on the mourners' bench which was the first row of the, of the church and these young people would sit there until they thought they had received the Holy Spirit. And then, but, but, to receive it, other people who already had it would have to know it.  And so his, his, his mother said she didn't think he was ready so that act deterred him from church, I mean, he, he has to take some responsibility on his own until he was a very, very old man, that he finally, you know, did what was already in his blood in the first place and it was out of ignorance that, that's how folks of that vintage looked at the religious experience.  I understand that now, I just thought it was very extraordinary that, that this is the way his mother had responded to him, but anyway--
Story_ID: 137166
Speaker 1: I remember my, because my father [Albert Irving Wagner] was, was drafted the year I was born, and he didn't get out of the war [World War II, WWII] until '45 [1945], so I, those formative years were with my grandparents and my mother [Clementine Nolan]. So I remembered Gross Street, I'd go all the way down to the end of hill, so they were on the corner and you go down this, it was like this one block and it was a dead end in a way, and there was a hill, you'd go up to the next street Franklin, but I knew everybody on the street and everybody knew me, and I knew all these folks and there were stories about all these people.  And my, what I remember about my grandfather [Thomas Nolan (ph.)], he was a hard worker, he worked at the, it was a tanning plant, tanning hides and leather and they made, you know, leather for shoes and purses and whatever, but he would, he traveled to hart--Hartford, Illinois, which oh, I guess maybe fifteen miles or so, and he'd get a ride every morning 'cause he, my grandfather never had a car, he rode the bus and, I always remember my grandfather getting up very early, going to work, come--coming home and my grandmother would have these huge meals, always prepared for him and he was, he wasn't a big guy, he's about my size, a little shorter, but he would eat these huge meals and then he would go to bed and, and he'd turn his radio on and listen to the ballgame or listen to the news and I remember his snoring and, and so now my sons say to my wife [Bennetta Mitchell Wagner], says, "How can you stand dad's snoring, how can you stay in the same room with him?" So I do the same thing he does.  I, I listen to the radio, I put my little earplugs in so my wi--wife won't hear it, I mean I do so many things that he did.  My grandmother, what I remember about her is that she was always cooking, she washed on Mondays, we would, she would, she would cook all the time, my grandfather had two gardens, one in the backyard and then there was a like two or three vacant lots across the street and he would, that was his garden space and he would, he would grow vegetables there and I would, I'd tag along with him and, you know, they would, he, he was so proud of his tomatoes, he would grow oxheart tomatoes and he'd say, boy that, that tomato, it--my middle name is Gerald so they, everyone at home calls me Gerry and I asked my mother that, I said well why did you all call me Gerry instead of Tony or Anthony.  She said because when you were born in Chicago [Illinois], the mafia was very prevalent and, and it was always Tony Bananas or Tony something, they were mafia names and she didn't want me to have this na--you know, have one of these bad names, so she made sure they didn't call me Tony at home, of course in California, everybody calls me Tony because it's a nickname for Anthony, so that's how I got the name Gerry.  So, my grandfather shortened it, he called me "Jer." It's kinda like J-E-R and a B on it and so h--he would say, or he'd call me Butch, he'd say, "Well look at this tomato boy, he said, "I bet it weighs about a pound, let me weigh this tomato," and he was so proud of his tomatoes, he, he planted three apple trees in the backyard and these apples, I saw the trees grow and they produced these great apples.  But he would come in the evening and after eating bef--a lot of times before he would go to bed, he would s--put on, he would, he would, be looking like this, he'd put on a suit, white shirt, hat, tie and he would sell suits.  He, he sold suits mail order suits, he would have swats of material and he would sell suits and he, and sort of my I guess, my sense of, of appropriate dress comes from him because he, one of the things he always told me, "Boy you always want to have a blue surge suit in your wardrobe," or he would look at a finish and he'd say, "Oh now, now that's a fine finish on there", and he would tell me about materials and, and that kind of thing.  So, I, I thought I had really made it when I was, I guess I was in high school and he, he had a suit made for me. And then he would go downstairs, he had his own little private space, he had this cabinet, plus so he sold suits and then he sold some products they were called Zanol, Z-A-N-O-L or Blair products, it was like spices, flavorings, you know, like vanilla, lemon flavors he would sa--he'd go door to door and sell this stuff and you know in retrospect, looking at his industriousness was amazing and he would, he would complete peoples income taxes for them who didn't know how to do it, you know his friends, he would do that for them, he was just, he was a, he was an amazing guy and I think about if he, if it were a different time, if he would have gotten formal education, there's no telling what this guy would have, would have been.
Story_ID: 137167
Speaker 1: But those are the times I remember.  Now at the end of this hill, the, the Gross Street [Alton, Illinois] kinda slanted down to a hi--an incline and at the foot of the hill, if you can imagine this, in the back of this, you know, houses along the way, but there was sort of like an alley back, in the back and this g--guy's name was, well what we called him was Tyne [ph.], Tyne Derrick and we, D-E-R-R-I-C-K was his last name but what folks would call him on the street wa--on Gross Street was Tyne Derks [ph.] that's what the--and, and I thought that was his name for a long time too, I, I met his brother, who was, it was Derrick, but Tyne had a team of horses and he, he sold, and his, and his wife was named Miss Lilly [ph.], and they were some characters.  I was very afraid of these horses but I was intrigued with them, they would come up the street and he would sell vegetables and haul things in this wagon and can you, I mean it's, it's amazing to me now thinking about this, this, this is one of the characters that was on Gross Street.  And so there was all these stories of these houses along this long block that I, I know and knew about and most of the people are dead.  The person who my mother [Clementine Nolan] first entrusted to, to, to babysit with me, Naveda [ph.] Stone, just a, and she was Naveda Robinson then, beautiful woman, but she died, I guess about two years ago and she was ninety-two when she died. But these are people that I remember and I still would go back and see when I would go home, or I would just call 'em up and, and, and amazingly enough, Emma Simmons [ph.], who lived at the foot of the hill on the other side of the street from Tyne Derrick, she and her husband Luther, they just adopted me, I mean, I was just their kid, they didn't have any kids and they later had a son who's like six years younger than me, he's like a little brother, but I, I called her about two weeks ago, I just picked up the phone, I still remember her telephone number after all these years, I--her number is, 618-4626, 44263, you know, I just know the number and there are people in Alton that I'll just call, these are old folks now and I'll just call and say, how you doing, so, you know, I wanna talk to you, I, well, well I always liked old people because you could learn stuff from them.  Other thing I lived, learned about, remember about growing up are the evenings, sitting out on the porch with this great elm tree out there with my grandmother and it could be my, my aunt, my great-aunt, my, my great-uncle's widow who lived with us or it could have been, I mean there's a whole  passage of people who would live with my grandparents and I would go over there, even after I had, we moved to Bell Street, 1305 Bell Street, that's where we moved to, I would just go over there and stay all night and, or sit on the porch, it would be dark and she would make a smoke.  She would get a can and put some rags in it and just light it and then douse out the flames and the smoke would keep away the mosquitos and this when all the stories would come out, when she would tell me all of these things that happened when they grew up.
Speaker 2: Oh my.
Speaker 1: And it was amazing.
Story_ID: 137168
Speaker 1: Certainly sounds like a wonderful neighborhood, you had a wonderful childhood.
Speaker 2: That was a great neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us something about your sister?
Speaker 2: My sister, I told she's four years older [sic, younger] than I am, she lives in Oakland [California], she has two sons and--
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name's Barbara Wagner Jim George [ph.], Jim George is her married name.  She married a Nigerian and they're, they're divorced.  Christopher [ph.] and Patrick [ph.] are her sons and they're like my nephew--they're like my sons, they're my nephews but they're like my sons and they're very close to their cousins, to their, to my sons, I have two sons.  But Barbara was one of the most mischievous people I've met (laughter) she was, she was a character. And the people on our street, she didn't grow up on Gross Street or didn't live there because we had moved.
Story_ID: 137169
Speaker 1: But on Bell Street where we lived [in Alton, Illinois], next door to me was my second grade teacher who I still call, she's in a nursing facility in Chicago [Illinois], but she was a character and that's a different, that's another story, who was married to my s--seventh grade teacher and math teacher and music teacher, I, I, started playing the piano when I was six and everybody on that block played some kind of instrument.  Next door to them was the principle of my middle school and my first grade teacher lived in the same ,--house, it was like a duplex and the librarian lived in this house.  Across the street from me was my third grade teacher so all of these teachers of mine lived in the same block.
Speaker 2: You couldn't get in trouble, could you?
Speaker 1: Could not get in trouble.
Speaker 2: You had to be good.
Speaker 1: And if I did, my parents [Albert Irving Wagner and Clementine Nolan] knew it before I got home.  So the principal's son played the flute and the clarinet, I played the piano and the organ and the oboe, across the street, Tony Henderson played trumpet, his brother, who was my best friend, is a day younger than me, he, he died two years ago, a year ago.  He, he played tenor sax as good as any jazz musician, his sister Caroline [ph.] plays piano, is the music director at her church in Saint Louis [Missouri].  Down the street Charles Gill [ph.] played piano and it was like that, I mean,--
Speaker 2: That's wonderful.
Speaker 1: --that was the, the neighborhood that I grew up in.
Speaker 2: So are you still interested in music?  Do you still play?
Speaker 1: I play, I have an organ at home and I, I play not nearly as much as I used to, 'cause I just don't have time and I would play, at my home church I was the church organist for what, I guess for about prob-probably about twenty years, not twenty years, no, no, no, it was about fifteen years, that I, I was the organist in our church until I left and of course when I come home all the time, they want me to play.  And, I, I would play at Third Baptist rarely because we have a good music staff, but if they don't have someone, sometimes I'll play.  But, I don't play oboe anymore, but yeah, I play, to play, playing is very therapeutic and relaxing.
Story_ID: 137170
Speaker 1: Are there any sights or sounds or smells when you come in contact with them, immediately takes you back to your childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Well, well there, there, there  are certain, my great aunt Millie and Millie Perkins [ph.] and Harry Perkins [ph.], they had no children so they adopted all of their nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews and there're certain sights, like if w--when I, and my wife [Bennetta Mitchell Wagner] even knows it, w--when we see hydrangea flowers, we say oh that's, that reminds us of Millie doesn't it, or we see dahlias, there's this one great picture of my Aunt Millie with a dahlias plant that's tall as she is and she's standing next to it and so what do I do, I grow dahlias, in my yard in the summer and when we see these, it reminds us of us, of, of them.  When I hear, when I smell mustard and turnip greens cooking it res--it reminds me of home and when I, when I, hear, when I see rivers or smell river fish cooking, it reminds me of home or, or there, there's like a an eggplant casserole that my grandmother used to make and we, and I cook and, and so, I'll cook that and that reminds me of Betsy Nolan [ph.], my, my grandmother.  There's just so many things that remind me of them that, that have imprinted on our lives, my sister and I talk about it all the time and certainly my wife who is, heard the stories so much it's like she's a part of the whole thing too.  And my, my wife is my Alton [Illinois] as well so she, she knows our family, but my wife is nine years younger than I am, so she didn't have some of the experiences  of growing up that I did, so she's heard them enough that, I think it's almost like she's lived them through me.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's wonderful.
Story_ID: 137171
Speaker 1: --You lived on a block with all your school teachers, could you tell us about elementary school, what's the name of the school that you went to?  What kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: I went to Dunbar School [Alton, Illinois] for kindergarten, I went to, oh, and I think it was like a two story building and it had four rooms in it and, and I went to Douglass School [Alton, Illinois] for first through the third grade, Hattie Carter [ph.] was my first grade teacher and I told she lived two doors from me and Mildred McGill [ph.] was my second grade teacher who live, who was Mildred Bolton [ph.] and, I, I lived through her marriage and she married Earl McGill [ph.], who, who was my music teacher and seventh grade  teacher, math teacher.  And then my third grade teacher was Charlene Cannon, who was a fantastic musician, a pianist, par excellence, so was Earl though, Earl McGill, played piano and trumpet, I mean these people could have been professional musicians, I mean, that's how well they played.  Charlene Cannon [ph.]  would play the carillon for Alton [Illinois] that was out in Garden Moore Park and she'd do that in the summers, but she, she was just, she was such a classy lady and, you know, periodically I would call her and she died about five years ago and I called her when she was in a nursing facility and you know, checked on her and because these people all made great imprints in my life.  And I, and I think one of the, these are, these are all African American people and then I went to Lovejoy [Elementary] School [Alton, Illinois], and that's where Jim Bailey [ph.] was the principal wo was, lived down the street from me and--
Speaker 1: Was that high school or middle school then?
Speaker 2: This is middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so this was, so I've told you about kindergarten up to the third grade, fourth grade was at Lovejoy, and my, my fourth grade teacher was Dorothy Scott [ph.] who had been in the military and the whole Scott family was Altonians and her sister, Irene and my mother were good friends and she was, she was a teacher too and so Dorothy was my fourth grade teacher, Grace Favors [ph.], I always remembered she was left handed, was my fifth grade teacher, she and my mother are in the same independent living facility now, I, I, I go see her (laughter), I see all these people.  Six grade teacher was Virginia Williams [ph.], who just died recently and my mother and her husband, Clayton Williams [ph.] who was a judge, and actually there was a, he lives in Vallejo [California], that was my sixth grade teacher, seventh grade teacher, I lent, went from Lovejoy School to Central School, which has now become Lovejoy School, because Lovejoy School was turned, torn down.  Anyway, and the reason Lovejoy is a n--name that's a big name in Alton, Elijah P. Lovejoy was an abolitionist and he was martyred and he was the editor of the Alton Evening Telegraph and Lovejoy--so some African Americans in Alton established the Lovejoy, Elijah P. Lovejoy Memorial Scholarship Fund, and I was one of the first recipients of the scholarship, it wasn't a big scholarship, but it was a scholarship.  So, in the ss--in the seventh, eighth and, I'll just say seventh and eighth grade, I was at Central School, Ethel Louis was one of my teachers who, I mean, it's funny how all these things are circular and incestuous. Ethel Louis' daughter was married to my mother's s--third husbands, to my, to my mother's third husband, Ethel Louis [ph.] daughter, her name was Myrtle, Myrtle was married to Eudel [ph.] Bradshaw, who was my mother's last husband and he just died on Halloween of last year.  They were, they were childhood classmates and so my mother had been widowed from her second husband for about fifteen years, they ended up marrying but Myrtle's h--mother, Ethel was my, my eight grade teacher.  I left the eighth grade and went to West Junior High school [Alton, Illinois], for the ninth grade and, and then from there I went to Alton Senior High School [Alton, Illinois]. Now--
Story_ID: 137172
Speaker 1: Alton [Illinois] schools were segregated except for the high school [Alton Senior High School, Alton, Illinois], they only had one high school so they, it was always integrated, but the schools were segregated until the, the Brown decision in '54 [Brown v. Board of Education, 1954], and you had a choice of either going to an integrated school or staying in the schools that were still segregated and we made the choice to stay in the segregated schools, and I, I thank God every day that we did.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: Because, those teachers, all those teachers knew me, they were interested in me and that isn't to say that white teachers aren't and weren't they were, but they knew who I was and, and they, it, it was just different and, you know, I talk to people who, who went to the integrated schools and those who didn't I just see a huge difference--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in what happened, so that's--
Speaker 2: I what kind of a student were you?  Were you rambunctious, were you obedient?  Did you--
Speaker 1: I was a--
Speaker 2: --Get in trouble?
Speaker 1: I was a devilish student,--
Speaker 2: You were?
Speaker 1: --I was a mischievous student.  I would do things, I would do things but I would never get caught.  I, I, and I was an instigator--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --Of, of things.  I remember in chemistry one year we, we made some sulfuric acid and, and got the--actually I have a, sulfuric acid burn on my, on my arm here from, from that and I remember we made some sulfuric, some hydrogen sulfide gas and we had them in test tubes and we'd open it in the room, several of us did, you, you know what hydrogen sulfide gas smells like, and so this room, we had to let people out.  And then one year--so that was one of the memories I had.
Story_ID: 137173
Speaker 1: Before we took our break you were talking about your high school [Alton Senior High School, Alton, Illinois], and that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --It had, with civil rights, I'm sorry the Brown [Brown v. Board of Education, 1954] decision that you had a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --segregated school and the other school and that you chose to stay with the segregated school and there were so many teachers who influenced you.  Was there one who really stood out?
Speaker 2: It was so many of them and so many of them are still alive like Mr. Bailey [ph.] who's the principal or was at my grammar school, at Lovejoy [Elementary] School [Alton, Illinois], he, he, had his ninetieth birthday last May and these are all, all these people would encourage me in some way, so it's very hard to pull one out.  I guess Mildred McGill [ph.] is the one that I'm closest too, and they're always proud of what I, whatever it is that I do and, but to say which one it was, it's hard to say--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Because they all made major contributions.  And we were talking about high school being integrated always and I guess, as I told you I, I, I did some mischievous things in high school.  I, I was, biology is my favorite subject and I was, I excelled in biology and I remember one year, one day, Mr. Colbert [ph.] who was our biology teacher, was absent and we had a substitute and we, we, you know, you're dissecting frogs, we put frogs in the water fountains so when people would go, you know, they, they were these porcelain fountains, those old kind, got ready to get their water, it'd be a fr--a dead frog in there, with f--fo--with formaldehyde in there of course.  But, and I remember, was this in high school or college?  I guess this was in college because I went to SIU, Southern Illinois University, I went to the Alton [Illinois] campus and to the Edwardsville campus [Southern Illinois University, SIUE, Edwardsville, Illinois], that's where I ended up getting my degree.  But we would dissect cats and I would have a--and pigs, I, you could, my mother [Clementine Nolan] would come home and I'd have th--a ca--maybe a cat in the refrigerator because, you know, you wanted to keep it from spoiling even though it had formaldehyde in it, I won't think it--'cause we kept in the frig--refrigerators at school and my mother would come home and she'd say, "What is this?"  So, I, I had lots of fun in school, I love school, I was a good student, I was, you got either gold alpha or a silver alpha for excellence and I got a silver alpha, I got an award in the eighth grade for, from the Daughters of American Revolution, these are the same people who didn't let Marian Anderson sing, but I got one from them for excellence and scholarship and I wasn't an athlete, but I was a scholar.
Story_ID: 137174
Speaker 1: What'd you do in your spare time?
Speaker 2: What did I do?
Speaker 1: Were you a boy scout, were you--?
Speaker 2: I was a boy scout, and definitely did that.  We played all day long, and so it was like a job, we would--we would go out in the morning, my friends from across the street and we would come in and get, you know, a sandwich or something at noon and we'd play until it was time to come in.  And we had thi--the most imaginative things of play.  We, we had, we would put on shows, we'd sell tickets for these shows, somebody would make the tickets, we were organized and people would, you know, have various things that they would, roles that they would play in these shows.  We would make camps when we'd go out, there was a place it was a lot of acreage out in, in Alton [Illinois] that was vacant and, and just grasses grew up there and trees and whatever, we called it green pasture and we lov--all of us loved to go play there.  We pi--picked blackberries in the summer there and actually I would sell blackberries to some people, some of my mother's [Clementine Nolan] friends and, but we would we'd make like teepees and we would cover these up and we'd have camps and we would have bonfires and this was all from play that we had seen on television with, with the way they portrayed Native Americans we--we would be then--we would--we would be the Indians or somebody would be the cowboys and we would--we were riding, we would ride ragweed sticks as our horses, 'cause they, when they dry they make good sticks--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --they also make good arrows, so we would use these, or spears, we would use these for throwing spears.  And one of the things that I think has happened to us as a country, we have programed our children out of playtime, so they have no creativity in their minds at all by the time they become adults and, and so they've been robbed of that.
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: And, and so we didn't, we didn't have, well we were poor, for one thing and we didn't know it, because we were very rich with what we got from each other.  And so, we would do these things.  At night we would make bonfires and we would dance around these fires and we would make our garments that we were wearing and all the kids in the neighborhood would, would, would, would do this and, would, would play this way so, I had a great growing up period, I mean, it was, it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: You certainly did.
Story_ID: 137175
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, what were your aspirations?  What did you think you would be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, I always knew I wanted to, I wanted to do, I wanted to be somebody.  I wanted to do something good and I, and I would wa--and I wanted to make a contribution to my community, I wanted my folks [Albert Irving Wagner and Clementine Nolan] to be proud of me, I wanted to be proud of myself and I wanted to be a role model for my children who at the time, I didn't know what my children, what gender they would be.  As it turned out I got just what I wanted, I got two boys.
Speaker 1: Oh, (laughter).  Okay.
Speaker 2: That I'm extraordinarily proud of.  But my aspiration was, at first I wanted to be a, a biologist or a zoologist, zoology and botany were my majors in college and, and, and chemistry was a minor, but then I found out that, that biologist didn't make any money, (laughter) so I had to figure s--to, to do something else.  But I always wanted to, you know, do something like that.  I, I also wanted to do something that involved people, I like people a lot and as it turned out, I ended up being a hospital executive, a hospital administrator, which was really a great marriage, I think of, of the skills that I had learned in dealing with people and a lot of times people will say, well how did you learn to do this and that or whatever and I could--attributed a huge part of it to the black church.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Because it'll a--afforded us as kids and as adults to do things that the white community wouldn't let us do, we--you know, you saw maids and you saw foundry workers would come to church and that's what they did by day, they'd come to church and they were chairman of the deacon board or, or chairman of the trustee board and they conducted meetings, by 'Robert's Rules of Order' [Henry Martyn Robert].  They took minutes, they, they could stand up and make a position and I always told people, I said, if you can navigate your way through black church--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --politics.  You can navigate your way through anything b--and, and so, that has played, I mean the people in the neighborhood schools, but I think the black church has been the most defining element in my life, I really attribute it to that.
Story_ID: 137176
Speaker 1: You finished high school, well how did you decide to go to college and what college did you go to?
Speaker 2: It was, it was no question whether I was going to college or not, period.  You go to college, people in our family, you go to college because you're told that a high school education isn't gonna be enough, you're gonna need your bachelor's [degree], of course now you need more than that, but it was no question and, and a--we were always told, people can take a lot of things away from you, but they can't take your mind away from you.  And so, get as much knowledge in your mind as you can and then use that, and so it was no question whether I was going to college, I had gotten a couple scholarships, the Elijah P. Lovejoy Scholarship and there's the Illinois State Scholarship I think I'd also gotten.  So, went to college and again, it's, it may have been a stupid thing to have done, but I did it.  When we, I, I, I got enrolled into Southern Illinois University [SIUE, Edwardsville, Illinois] and was going there and in the midst of that we started building a new church, and, and this is an interesting story too.  The church was kind of like the family, it didn't have a lot of money either I mean, this is, but we built a fantastic church, the church is just very functional, just a great church so, it's all brick church, it's 60 by 110 feet in size, it's a 45 pitch fire--45 pitch feet pitch roof in a "A" frame style and it has an "L" off the side that's, no it's a 102 feet, 60 by 102 feet and the "L" is 110 feet by 35 feet, two story brick, built in 1967.  So, I was in school and working also at the school cafeteria as a busboy, but I was so interested in this church that I dropped out of school to help get this done, not building it myself but it was a lot of the logistics. My neighbor from across the street was a major in architecture at, at the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois] and with my concepts and with his drawing, we really designed the church.  We--then we had, the church had a, a real architect to sort of validate the plans and, and tweak them but that church is my vision and Tony Henderson's work that he did and, and his drawings.  And so, the church let us do things like that, we would have youth, youth Sunday where all the young people were in charge of everything, or I would go to the church business meetings and as a member, you know, as a Baptist, you--the congregation is sovereign and, and that's, that's one of the reasons I am a Baptist, it's a democracy and not a theocracy and I would get up and voice my point of view and so, I learned those skills and, and sort of those expectations from that.
Story_ID: 137177
Speaker 1: And so, getting back to college, dropped out, got drafted, went to Vietnam [War], that was in 1966, spent a year stateside, went to Vietnam in '67 [1967], was there during the Tet Offensive of 1968, got an early out to come home and finish my degree.
Speaker 2: Were you in the infantry?
Speaker 1: No.  It was the interesting, I, I was working in that summer that I was drafted for Alton Memorial Hospital [Alton, Illinois] as an assistant to the pathologist as a radio isotope technician doing radioisotope studies for people who, who were suspected of having cancer, either thyroid cancer or bone scans, that kind of stuff, I would do the, I'd work the machines.  The administrator there said to me, the associate administrator said, "Tony, I know you have probably been told never to volunteer for anything in the army once you get in, and said normally that's right but let me give you some advice, you should volunteer to be a chaplain's assistant." And I said well why?  What is that?  So he told me what it was, it's basically the chaplain's clerk, administrative assistant and he said the reason you should volunteer is because you play the organ, he said it will serve you well.  He never was so right.
Story_ID: 137178
Speaker 1: It--I avoided all the--the scud duty in the [U.S.] Army, I never had KP [kitchen patrol], I didn't have to go, you know, one of the things you hate to do is go through the gas chamber.  You take your mask off and you go through it, you try to hold your breath and you go to this place where there, you have this gas and it gets all in your eyes, I didn't have to do that, it was just all the scud work I never had to do because I played the organ, I got paid extra for it and I played for the Protestant services of course because I was the Protestant chaplain's assistant, but I also played for the Catholic services and I played for, I didn't play for, but I went to the Jewish Seders on Fridays, mainly just to learn about their religion.  So, I, I, really learned a lot and broadened my exposure and I think tolerance for other faiths and understandings of them, so I, and then in, on the, in the afternoons, the Episcopal priest would fly over from Cam Ranh Bay [Cam Ranh, Vietnam], I was in the (unclear) Vietnam, and I would play for their services, so I under--I learned the differences between, sort of a high church service and, you know, low mass service and I, I learned the difference between a conservative and a reformed rabbi and how they conducted their services.  I remember during Passover, since I was the Gentile in the group, I was asked to go to the airport to pick up the bitter herb for them, which was horseradish and they, you know, live horseradish and that was part of the Seder preparation and they gave us too much wi--they gave the, the, the Jewish soldiers too much wine, they doubled the order for the wine so we had this--I don't know how many ba--cases we had of this syrupy sweet Manischewitz wine, but in the army it doesn't matter, so we used this extra wine to barter for steaks at, at, with the--with the mess hall and at the, at the supply sergeant for jungle boots, that was a big thing then and fatigues.  We, we would use it as a bartering agent and, you know, we wer--we were very industrious and we're in Vietnam.  I taught a Vietnamese priest, I helped him with his English, he helped me with my French and I collected specimens, because where we were stationed in Vietnam, it was, it had previously been a French resort on the South China Sea, Le Grand Hotel, is where the headquarters were and it was w--it was like stateside because it was headed by a lieutenant general, which is a three star general, it was two major generals there and a brigadier general and about forty full-bird colonels, so it, it, it was a, it was a corps headquarters.  General [William] Westmoreland would fly up from Saigon [Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam], there every month to have his generals conferences because it was safer and, you know, it was like a resort too, they had taught the, the French who had been there before, had taught the Vietnamese their cuisine, so there was a fusion of Vietnamese and French cooking and so the cooking was just fabulous. Anyway, we, I collected, there was a colony of lizards that I hadn't seen, I hadn't keyed out before, and so I, I collected some specimens and sent them back to, to SIU [Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, SIUE, Edwardsville, Illinois] and some insects I did and so I was doing a study on their behavior and was writing it up and sending it in and so that was one of the, the, the write-ups that my dad [Albert Irving Wagner] had on his wall, you know, he got it outta the paper and there it was on his wall that day I went by and saw all these clippings that he had of me.  So, I've always felt that you make the best out of your situation that you have, so my year in Vietnam ended up being one of the best years of my life.
Speaker 2: It certainly was.
Story_ID: 137179
Speaker 1: --The one downside of it was during the Tet Offensive [Vietnam War], because we were at the corps headquarters, we, we hardly ever were attacked, you could maybe hear it once in a while, but we were attacked and the--and a lot of people were like me, they had been drafted, they were in college, you know, we weren't gung ho soldiers and we heard, you know, we'd hear about, we, we knew they were falsifying the, the body counts of, for political reasons and we'd come back and talk about all this foolishness that was going on.  But that night, and, and it would get down to about 90 degrees at night and you'd be cold, you'd need a blanket, y--you know, everything is relative, 'cause in the day it would be 120 degrees, but that night we were in our, in our Quonset huts and it's, I guess about twenty guys in a hut, you know, it, it was two rows and it's and an aisle going, an aisle going down the center and your bunks going end to end, you could see the tracers outside going by and, and we hadn't been accustomed to a war, so you know we got under our bunks, we didn't know what to do and we had our M16s, but--and then the rock group which is the South Korean Army which they were really tough, that the whole unit which was about five blocks from us, you s--they all were killed, it was about fifty-four of them were killed in that unit, so it was tough, and so sh--so this was like, I think January 28th and it was getting very close time for me to, to come home and I said, "God are you gonna let me stay here this long and, and let me get killed?  (Laughter).  Get me home."  So I got an early out because you can get a ninety day early out, if you're going, if you were going back to college to finish your degree and so I did.
Speaker 2: That's a wonderful story, thanks for sharing that.  About this, this was like '67 [1967]?  Right?
Speaker 1: '67 [1967] to '68 [1968], is when I got out.
Story_ID: 137180
Speaker 1: Before that, the Civil Rights Movement was, you know, really going like '64 [1964], '65 [1965], how did that affect you?
Speaker 2: Well, well--
Speaker 1: --Or did it change your outlook?--
Speaker 2: Well yeah.  Well see it, the--th--sort of the middle, when it was really in its apex, I was in the, '66 [1966] to '68 [1968], I was in the [U.S.] Army.--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --But I was hearing about it and I wasn't, you know, I, I always felt that the, the most lasting change that we can make as African Americans would be from the inside, so we can make them on the outside and, and, and my strategy was to get in the decision making areas of the corporate structure that you're end and so you can really make, be a decision maker and, and in my career I've always done that, but I, when I got out, you know, so that was, that was, March, I think, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] had, had just been killed and they were rioting. We were going up to Chicago [Illinois] to a great aunt's funeral, and they were rioting and so we had to drive around the area that we were trying to get to, to get to our destination because of the riots and I, and I, I finally concluded that as, as, as heinous, not heinous but as, as destructive as they were, they were absolutely necessary to get the attention of this country.  As we see now, some forty something years later, it still hasn't happened, I mean, what's happened in [Hurricane] Katrina, in New Orleans [Louisiana] is tacit example of the racism that still exist in this country, so I don't know what it's going to take, but you know something did happen as a result of, of those riots, it, you know, the Watts Riots [Los Angeles, California, 1965] and, and what happened all over the country.  But our memories are very short and our biases and our prejudices, and I say ours because they're on both sides, but these clearly were white prejudices against black people and they're still, they're very deep, they're very ingrained and they, they just came out.  So, I, my, what I finally concluded was that the riots and, and what happened as horrible as it all was, was necessary in this country, 'cause what we had, the system that was ongoing and the injustices that existed, were equally as horrible.

Speaker 1: Okay so you've come back from Vietnam [War], and you're back in school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you graduate from?
Speaker 2: Southern Illinois--
Speaker 1: Southern Illinois--
Speaker 2: --University [Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, SIUE, Edwardsville, Illinois].
Speaker 1: --And you go on to Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I went to work once I graduated for about a year or so for the P.D. George Company, which was a coatings plant in St. Louis [Missouri], they coated wires with various things to protect the wires and, but it was, it was terrible, it was a terrible environment to work in as far as physical environment, because of the fumes that came from these very toxic hazardous substances that were being put together. And, and you know, I worked in the lab, a--as a chemical technician and we would have various combinations of these t--to put coatings on these wires that would protect them from very high heat, they may be used in airplanes they could have been used in all kinds of places. Well, I knew I didn't wanna stay there, I didn't wanna stay in a laboratory, I didn't wanna stay as, in something so environmentally hazardous to your health.  Meantime, my wife [Bennetta Mitchell Wagner] was a nursing student at Saint Luke's Hospital in St. Louis [Missouri]  and so she, she stayed there 'cause they had a dorm, but she would go home on weekends and so her, and so I said, you know Bennie, her name is Benetta, Benetta Mitchell , I said, well I'll, I'll give you a ride home, y--you can ride home with me and, I always thought she was kinda cute anyway and, but I was going with someone else and so, but you know, we going to the same church, she has a twin sister and they were, they were, she is a fraternal twins, but for a longtime, I couldn't tell the difference from them.  Anyway, we, we, you know I would work at P.D. George, and I would give her a ride home periodically and, one day her mother said to her, s--she was, she was, Bennie was the only African American student in her school and or at least in her class, I think in the whole school, but she had been asked and selected to be in the, they were having a sweetheart dance, to be in the queen's court and all the guys that she would have asked to go were down in Southern Illinois for some, some fraternity party or something so her, her mother said, "Well why don't you ask Gerry Wagner [Anthony G. Wagner], he's an upstanding young man in the community?"  And Bennie is very bashful about those kinds of things, oh mom, you know, she says, go on and ask him, so I, I she asked me and so, I immediately says yes, so I, I, so I, then I have this problem 'cause I have a girlfriend, so I go tell her.  I said, "I hope you'll understand, this young lady is the only black student in class, she doesn't have anybody to go with her to this and will you, you know, agree to this for the cause?" (laughter) Per se, so foolishly she agreed. So we go to this dance and it was very boring and on the way home, we, we're almost home, we're about, oh twelve blocks from her house, we're at a stop sign and I, just lean over and get a little kiss at the stop sign and I said to myself, well what do we have here?  So we, so we go up to this Riverview Park that overlooks the river where, where couples go up and neck, so, we go up there and several kisses later, we come back and I take her home, I said now you can't tell anybody this, I said, you're just too young, 'cause she's nine years younger than me.  I said I, I'm, I, I just would hate anybody know that I was, I said, I wasn't trying to take advantage of you or anything, so, she says okay, she's real cool.  Monday morning, this is Friday, Monday, I'm calling her, you wanna go to a movie (laughter)? So, it was obvious that, you know, this is gonna be more than just this.  So I go tell my--I had to tell my girlfriend that it wi--it w--this went into more than I thought it was and so, we, a year later, I was interviewing with Upjohn [pharmaceutical company] that following November and they interviewed me and they said yeah, we want to hire you but we want to relocate you to Minneapolis [Minnesota].
Story_ID: 137182
Speaker 1: So you've met your wife [Bennetta Mitchell Wagner] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you've decided she's gonna be the love of your life and you did--and you find out your job is being transferred to--
Speaker 2: To Minneapolis [Minnesota].
Speaker 1: --Minneapolis.
Speaker 2: So I, so I said to her, and the other--my wife told me, she said the, the night, the moment I met you, that we went to this thing, I, I said to myself, he's the one.  So, she, she never tells me this until afterwards so, you know, she's being cool through the whole thing and so when I got the offer from Upjohn [pharmaceutical company], I said, you know, I'm gonna be relocating and you're in the middle of nursing school, why don't you wait until June of the f--next year, and b--wo--you know, finish your nursing school and then we'll get married in June.  She said, "No, it's now or never," she said "I know you," she said, "It's now or never," so, so, I said, "Okay."  So we got married, so the offer was made in November, we got married in January, January the 9th--
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: --1971, and we--we'll celebrate our thirty-fifth anniversary in January of this year and anyway we got married and the, the mar--the wedding was really funny, we had first said, let's just have a very small wedding 'cause we don't have money and, just invite family.  Well my family's quite large, particularly then, and all the people who live in Alton [Illinois] and hers was not, not as large as mine but because I'd played for our church and been very involved then all these church people who know me they wanted to come.  So each time we would--each layer we would go, you know, like rings, we'd go to another catchment ring and it would be more people.  We sent out twelve hundred, I think, I believe we sent out six hundred or so invitations, it was about twelve hundred people came to the wedding, even the balcony was full, of the church and it's large.  They're three sections of rows in our church, and, and the church was full and, we, we got married and we honeymooned up at her aunt and uncle's cabin up on the Illinois River, had an--I bet she's forgotten this, we had an accident in my car, I had a little '68 [1968 Mercury] Cougar, had an accident in the car because I slipped on ice, it was an ice storm, and so we had to get the car fixed while we were there, so we got the car fixed, drove to Minnesota, got there, it was nine below zero (laughter).
Story_ID: 137183
Speaker 1: So we got there and I worked for Upjohn [pharmaceutical company] for a couple of years and I knew, always knew that it was not something I wanted to, to do as being a detailed man or as the more formal name, as a pharmaceutical sales rep but we call them detail men.  And I met the, and became friends with the director of the University of Minnesota Hospitals and Clinics [later, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota], John Westerman, and John said to me, he said, "Tony, he said, why aren't you, why don't you go to our, through our program? It was the best in the country as a, as a hospital administrator." He said, "You're a natural for this." And I said well, I don't know.  So, I thought about it.  I had the GI Bill, Bennie [Bennetta Mitchell Wagner] had finished her nursing school and was nursing, you know, had a job in a hospital and I said, well, yeah, why, why not?  So, I applied, I got accepted and went through the program, it's a two year program, a year of didactic academic work, and then it's a year's residency and my residency was at the University of California, San Francisco [San Francisco, California] with [Robert] Bob Derzon, that's how we got here.
Story_ID: 137184
Speaker 1: So, I--
Speaker 2: Did you choose to come to California, or that's where they sent you?
Speaker 1: Well, the way Minnesota's [University of Minnesota Hospitals and Clinics, later University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota] program works, it mat--it tries to match the personality, the skills, the aspirations of the student with the prototype of the medical center or hospital that you're going to or clinic, whatever you're gonna go to.  And this, everybody wanted to come to San Francisco [California], and I didn't quite know why, you know, I didn't, I'm, I'm just a, a country bumpkin from Alton [Illinois], I'm not knowing what San Francisco was like and everybody wanted to come here.  So I, Derzon, Bob Derzon [Robert Derzon] who was the CEO there and actually became the first HCFA [Health Care Financing Administration, later Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)] administrator in the Carter Administration, even though he's a republican, he headed, HCFA is the Health Care Financing Administration, which has now been replaced by the centers for Medicaid and Medicare, but it, it, it's oversees the Medicaid and Medicare programs.  Back then, which was in '75 [1975], he had a budget of $38 billion dollars and it--that's how big it, and it's much bigger than that now.  Anyway, his second in command, his COO, Bill Kerr [William "Bill" Kerr], came for Preceptors Week and he selected me as the resident.  I come back and spend my residency and, and I got hired which was unusual, they usually, you go on and try to seek your job, well they kept me, they hired me and I stayed there for fifteen years and left there as the Deputy Associate Director of the medical center, was hired by Dave Werdegar, who was an associate dean at UCSF [University of California, San Francisco in San Francisco, California], he hired me to head Laguna Honda Hospital, which is the largest single site facility of its kind in the country, it's 1200 beds.  David's wife, David Werdegar wife is Justice Kathryn Werdegar, who is on our [associate justice on the] Supreme Court of California and so they're good friends of ours, we just went to David's seventy-fifth birthday two weeks ago, we, we, we held our trip, held up our trip from going wherever it was, to Washington D.C., because we wanted to go to David's birthday party that Saturday.  But anyway, here we are in San Francisco, as a result of those moves--
Story_ID: 137185
Speaker 1: There'll be some young people who'll be listening to this tape and you're a hospital administrator, could you just explain what maybe some of your duties were?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at UCSF [Medical Center, University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, San Francisco, California], I--the hospit--and, and that's a good question because most people don't know what hospital administrators do.  People go to the hospital 'cause they're ill and they come out, but they don't know what the workings of it is like.  Hospital administration is, is very much akin to hotel administration because it's a lot of the same services, its housekeeping, its food services, but on top of that are all the clinical services that you provide.  So the hospital administrator is the person who manages all of that and make your stay, hopefully as pleasant and productive as possible and, and for hospitals, as short as possible.  So my job was at UCSF, I had all of, most of the surgical services and, and the way hospitals a--academic medical centers are organized, it's by services, you know you have the medicine service which is internal medicine, and you have pediatrics and whatever, well I had the surgical services and I had orthopedic surgery, general surgery and pediatric surgery, I had anesthesiology, which was the, who are the people who pass the gas when you're, you know, putting you out to have the surgery, well there's a whole cadre of people and it's, it's, and it's sub divided even more so dow--like to a pediatric anesthesiologist, like my brother-in-law, Bennie's [Wagner's wife, Bennetta Mitchell Wagner] brother's an anesthesiologist down in Southern California, down in Los Angeles [California] and he's a general anesthesiologist, so if you were to come in he'd probably give you, the person to give you gas.  But they also manage pain clinics, like I went all over the country looking at pain centers with, with an anesthesiologist that was gonna run it to see what was the best practices so we could organize one at UCSF, and we built one.  So, it was me or the administration who are providing the resources for the practitioners to practice their craft.  All of the radiology services, and we had, we had when I left UC [University of California], we had twelve or fourteen services of radiology, you had general radiology, you had x-ray, you had head MRI, you had body, whole body MRI, you had people who did your neuroradiology, so you had a kinds of these services, they all reported to me so they came to me when they wanted to buy equipment and all their equipment cost a heck of a lot of money.  Just to prep a room, say this, say if this were going to be a room where the person was gonna have--we were gonna put a machine and to do fluoroscopy, outside would be a room where the technician works so that they won't get zapped with radiology, with, with, with, with x-rays every time they worked the machine.  Just to prep the room, when--this was fifteen years ago, was 250,000 dollars, just the room getting it ready, the machines cost like a million dollars, or, or more than that, I had radiation oncology and then all of the staff reported up to me, and so, that's what I did.  Then when I became the CEO of the hospital and so that was just a piece of the pie, I had the whole pie when I became the CEO of the hospital.
Story_ID: 137186
Speaker 1: Then when I left, Laguna Honda Hospital [San Francisco, California], and the thing that, I guess one of my biggest contributions I think there was wh--Laguna Honda was built in--
Speaker 2: It's in La--I'm sorry Laguna, California?
Speaker 1: Laguna Honda Hospital, which is in San Francisco--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --California.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Laguna Honda means deep lake and it's near a reservoir, and that's why it's named that, but it's in the middle of San Francisco and the Forest Hills area, great area of the city, right in the middle of the city, it was, it was built in 18--1868, and it was eight, the building were aging, the oldest buildings were built in 1907, and the main building was built in 1926, and they were built w--with wards that had thirty patients in it, it, it was a single, a single corridor down and then all these patients foot-to-foot, and you know, they don't have hospitals that way anymore.  So, we'd gotten waivers over the years with the federal government to continue to do that but, you know, the--finally they called to question, and we had to build a hospital.  Well, that had been avoided for years in San Francisco, people didn't have the political will and it just cost a heck of a lot of money to replace that many beds.  Well, we finally got the powers that be of the city to agree to put it on the ballot.  I, I knew if we would ever put it on the ballot, 'cause I, I know what people felt, feel about that facility in San Francisco.  It would pass.  You needed a, a two-thirds majority because it's a general obligation bond to pass, not just a simple majority.  We passed it with a 73.4 percent plurality and I, I thought that was a major accomplishment.  I had left physically as the CEO, but it was still reported to me because I--my next job was the, the CEO for the Community Health Network, which included Laguna Honda, San Francisco General, 185 bed mental health facility and seventeen clinics, in the city and county of San Francisco, inpatient and outpatient clinics with about 6000 employees.
Speaker 2: So, then I retired in July of 2003, from the city and was retired for about a year and a half, when I was tapped for this job.
Story_ID: 137187
Speaker 1: You had, before we go on to this job, June 16th in San Francisco [California] was an important day.  Do you know why?  You don't remember?
Speaker 2: June 16th?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Of 2003.
Speaker 2: June 16th?
Speaker 1: There was a city proclamation?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter) oh that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, that.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.  I re--I re--I, I didn't remember the date.  This was Anthony Wagner Day?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: In the city and county of San Francisco.  You know, I've, I have a number of awards, you know sitting on these walls because, actually in my office that I was, had been in, I, I don't have a lot of awards on the walls, at my, in my study at home, I do a--and I just don't, you know, there's a couple awards that I, that I really, that are really dear to me and when we finished the office, we're in the process of finishing this off--this office, 'cause like, I've only here about eight months.  They'll be some very personal things that I'll bring in, but I don't, you know, I just kind of keep them at home.
Speaker 1: How did that make you feel, having a day named after you?  Your mother [Clementine Nolan] must have been ecstatic?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was, you know, you know, and I was too, but I don't know, it's, it was, it was, it was nice, it was re--
Speaker 1: You must have done something, been a re--a really good administrator for them to, to name a day, and I think you're being very modest.  What were some of the things that you accomplished?
Speaker 2: Well those--
Speaker 1: Wi--with this--
Speaker 2: --Were some of the things--
Speaker 1: --With this, okay--
Speaker 2: --Those were some of the things.  I remember having to make a very, very difficult decision.  We had a huge budget deficit in the city, and the city, that's where you get a large part of our funding from, for Laguna Honda [Hospital, San Francisco, California], and for those, those facilities that I've mentioned.  They're all sitting in county owned and as you know, or you may not know, San Francisco is a city and--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --County entity.  So, we had a huge deficit and everybody was, had to chip in and--
Speaker 1: Did you have any damage from the, I'm sorry, the,--the
Speaker 2: --Pro--long (unclear)
Speaker 1: --Earthquake?
Speaker 2: We did.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: We got all of our money from FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency], we got every dime.
Speaker 1: FEMA did something good.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: We did, and, and I can't take credit for that, but my COO, Larry Funk [ph.], this guy was like a bee on a bonnet, he stayed on FEMA's behind.  He, he took photographs immediately and I said take photographs of everything, all the cracks, everything, so we had this photo album that we plopped on the table to FE--to FEMA and said, here, this is what needs to be fixed.  So, we got a lot of our money, most of it to repair everything, so, yeah, we did have some damage.
Story_ID: 137188
Speaker 1: But, so that's an (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the budget.
Speaker 1: --accomplishment. That's an accomplishment.
Speaker 2: Yes, and you had that--
Speaker 1: Going back to the budget, we really had gotten to the point where we had cut everything around the clinical services and we weren't going there 'cause that's where the care was involved, but then I sat down with my director of nursing, who I, I have the highest regard for her, her passion, for her, her craft and her profession, she, she had a tenacious, she was tenacious about getting resources and, and eking them out when there seemed to be nothing in that turnip, she would get some blood out of it and she had been, if you can imagine this, the director of nursing for forty-four years, before she retired.  So she had been there and she is a very opinionated person, and very protective of her service and I went to her and said, "You've gotta make some cuts and where I would make the cuts, is here, here, and here." It was administrative functions because that's where the big dollars were. I said, I'm not gonna be cutting this, the CNAs 'cause that's who really gives, provides most of the care (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A CNA is a?
Speaker 1: The certified nursing assistants, or at some places they're called nurses aides [nursing aides], in a nursing facility and that's what Laguna Honda [Hospital, San Francisco, California] is, that's who provides most of the care, I said so, it doesn't make sense to cut them, you could, you could double up on how you're doing your administrative stuff, "Oh, I can't cut anything." She was gonna cut a few LVNs [licensed vocational nurse]. I said, "No, that's who delivers the care." So what--the way Laguna Honda was organized is forty nursing units and each nursing unit has a head nurse, but they were across from each other like, this. There's a single aisle that goes down the hallway and over here is a nursing unit and here's one, all the way down with these thirty patients in each unit.  So I said, "Why don't you cut a head nurse and double up the head nurses," and these people wouldn't lose their jobs, actually they would bump into something else.  She didn't wanna do that.  I said, "Look, the decision has to be made, and if you don't make it, I will."  So I did.  It was very difficult.  I hated to have done it, but I, I didn't, I didn't think I had any choice to do it so, in a way it's a difficulty and in another way I think it was an accomplishment.  In it's a tough decision that an administrator had to make, 'cause all your decisions as an administrator aren't pats on the back. You have to make some decisions that you think are in the best interest for everyone and not just one group of people and you have to look at things as broadly as you can with input from lots of folks, but ultimately, you have to make a decision. So that was, that was another thing that happened in my career.
Story_ID: 137189
Speaker 1: Before I left UC [University of California, San Francisco Medical Center], I designed with the anesthesiologist who was gonna run it, our ambulatory surgery center.  Our surgeons do zit, do surgery at UC and they look out at the Golden Gate Bridge and look over at Mount Tamalpais, I don't want them to do that to long though (laughter) with, they, 'cause they might miss the patient, but that, that was something else I did, we, we built the pain center there.  And I was ta--I was just talking to a person who is retiring for thirty years from UC, he, he was the UC chaplain, he also reported to me.  And I said, "Rod [ph.]?"  'Cause they wanted me to have some words at his, at his retirement function next week, I said, "I just wanted to check some facts with you, I said I did hire you didn't I?"  He said yes.  So we talked through a number of things that had happened and he reminded of something, he said, "I remember very distinctly the first day I met you, what you told me, one of the things you told me."  And I said "Well, what was that?"  He said, "You said, See the dust on this, on this shelf here?'"  And he said yeah.  I said, "Well the creditability of the Chaplin Service is no higher than that."  And I said, "We have to do something about it."  So he always remembered that and as I was talking to him to have just kind of rehearsed in my mind, and refreshed in my mind all things that, that service had accomplished, I said, "You know, Rod?  It's like hearing all of this stuff now is like seeing a child grow up that you birthed," and I said, "that's, that why I h--feel about that service."  So I have a lot of, I have a lot of very pleasant memories of accomplishment there.
Story_ID: 137190
Speaker 1: The Chamber of Commerce gave me a Managerial Excellence Award from San Francisco [California] for my management in there and I think really the tenet, the basic tenet of my management philosophy is really to treat people the way you would like to be treated and to engage people in the decision making process.  This is one of the reasons that I accepted this position and came out of retirement, b--to head the office of Labor Management Partnership whose tenets is that you make decisions at the level of the person who is doing the work and as opposed to sitting in an office saying this is what so-and-so should do.  You know, why wouldn't I go ask an environmental services staff person, what do they think about the cleaning products that they should use in cleaning a surgical suite, since they're the ones that do it?  I don't, why wouldn't I ask them?  You know, are, are, are some more caustic?  Are, are just, are some more effective, what do you think?  Are, or if I'm going to have a new technology that comes in and it's gonna replace some people, why don't I talk to my labor partners about that upfront, figure out with them how we can redeploy staff in a way, still keep the company whole, but also on the other hand support and, our employees.  They may not have the same job, but they're still employed.  It, it was a ba--it's a, it was a basic way I had of, that I thought about doing and, and that I sort of intuitively did, but when I heard of the opportunity of a company whose policy was to do that, I said, well how can I not do this?  And I, I had talked to David Lawrence, who had been the CEO and Chairman of Kaiser [Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals] about, I guess, six, seven years ago, he was presenting this whole concept, the Labor Management Partnership to an organization that I was a member of, actually on the board of trustees of it and I heard the presentation, I said this is fascinating, I said, and so I, every once in a while, I would ask people from Kaiser, how's that going?  And is it working?  And it's not perfect but it is so right I think in how an organization should relate to its employees, that I'm just very elated to be a part of that process.
Story_ID: 136559
Speaker 1: Okay, before we left, you had in your career, made this move to Kaiser [Family Foundation] and so you were just gonna explain a little bit about the history of Kaiser--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was saying-
Speaker 1: --and its philosophy.
Speaker 2: --that I thought the Labor Management Partnership doesn't probably wouldn't necessarily w--fit with every corporation, although I think its tenets has a place in every work place.  But it was a natural, I believe for Kaiser because of Kaiser's history and as I was saying, Henry J. Kaiser was building all of these things, whether it was the Grand Coulee Dam or whether it was the canals in, in Los Angeles [California] or a ship a day, if you can believe this, these, these were ships, producing a ship a day--
Speaker 1: Three (unclear).
Speaker 2: --For, for World War II.  He had to have his workers to remain healthy, so he, he and Dr. [Sidney] Garfield decided early on that Dr. Garfield would establish its clinics to take care of the workers, but shortly it was discovered it wasn't enough money to do it.  So what they'd--decided to do was capitate the k--the, the, the premiums which meant that you're charged a certain amount every month regardless of whether you're well or sick and that covers your care, everything that you'd needed to be done and that's the beginning of, of an HMO [health maintenance organization plan]. And this is one of the oldest HMOs, and so that's what happened.  Shortly after the workers started receiving their care, they demanded that their families would receive the same care or, or else they were gonna strike, so it expanded.  So that's how Kaiser got started in the healthcare business.  It really was this, this other ship building and construction business, but the off shoot became this and now it is, it's the parent because you know, several years later, sixty-some odd years later, and a 140,000, now a hundred th--forty thousand employees, 15,000 physicians and a $30 billion dollar revenue stream, this is not an insignificant health plan, it's the largest in the country.
Story_ID: 136560
Speaker 1: Now, we [Kaiser Family Foundation] have eight regions and the largest regions are in California, we have 8.3 million members and about 6 million of those members are in California.  But we have a region in Georgia, we have regions in the Middle Atlantic States which includes Washington D.C., Virginia, and we have a region in Ohio, we have a region in Colorado, and we have a region in Hawaii and we have a region in the northwest.  So, we're all, you know, we're pretty big and doing what I do, I spent my first, up until, up until this month, I've spent all my time in the national bargaining that was going on for the national agreement, the agreement was up, came to an end September 29th, and it was a five year agreement, so we had to bargain to make sure we would have a new agreement, so it was probably the best orientation I could get, even though my job is not just that, I have, labor relations reports to me.  But my job really is to see that the, the Labor Management Partnership principles, or becomes a way of doing business for Kaiser, it's not a parallel structure, it's not an appendage, it's not an add-on, it's not an afterthought, it's integrated totally in how we do business.  So when I'm getting ready to go and do whatever it is, I'm doing this in partnership with labor, so that I won't turn around and they say to me, well you didn't think of us and did you think of this, this, and this and we don't have this, this adversarial relationship.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is by no means perfect at Kaiser, if it were I wouldn't have a job, and I tell people all the time, that my goal as, my sort of my, my total success in this job is when I won't be needed anymore.  And, and I sincerely mean that.  I, I think what my goal has to be is for Kaiser not to need a Tony Wagner, to be insuring that it gets integrated.  The, the partnership principles get integrated throughout the organization, that it becomes a, just a way of doing business and I, I'll be re--ready to hang up my shingle then.
Speaker 2: About how long is the, the program been in effect?
Speaker 1: Since 1997.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's eight years.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, about eight years.
Speaker 2: So you're enjoying your new job?
Speaker 1: I'm having a great time, I'm having a great time.  I have access to everybody from George Halverson, down to anybody.  People have been very gracious, they're people who are skeptical of this arrangement because it's counter to what the traditional relationship between labor and management has been.  But we have said, as a organization, this is how we're gonna do business.  The board has, the Kaiser Board has put its stamp of approval on it, so that's all I need.
Story_ID: 136561
Speaker 1: You've been very, very busy.  You, you're, you belong to a number of civic and professional groups?  Are there any you want to tell us about?
Speaker 2: Well one, it's not a group per se--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't think, it's something that's, that evolved out of my relationship with the, the hospital council in northern central California.  I was a member of the Board of Trustees of the California Healthcare Association, which is the, another name for the hospital association and the executive committee. And each region in the state, there are three other regional groups and northern central California is one of the regional groups and then there's the sections--and there's a San Francisco [California] section which includes eleven hospitals.  I was the co-chair of that section for three years with a colleague of mine in San Francisco, when I left and retired, they asked me would I--and, and, and during that tenure, we did, we had a survey done of the health status of all ethnic groups in San Francisco.  As it turned out, African Americans, not surprisingly, fared worse than any ethnic group in San Francisco, not to say that there weren't some ethnic groups that had some, some health statistics that were unacceptable, a--almost all of African Americans were and they were just, they were more or less like a third world country.  I knew this from working in the health department and would hear these statistics but, it didn't really ring home to me until we had these statistics presented, all the hospital administrators were there, all of the members of the board of supervisors were there, which is our legislative body for the city and county of San Francisco.  The mayor was there, Mayor Willie Brown [HM Honorable Willie L. Brown], and a number of healthcare types of folks, it was 200 people at the Fairmount Theater, 'cause we had ten tables, twenty tables with ten people around it so it was 200 people there, my, my co-chair of the council and I were co-emceeing this event.  And when I saw these statistics rolling off the screen, and it happened to be Black History Month, so I, it, it just kind of all, was so focused and poignant at the time, there's a confluence of things, I, I just said from the podium, I said this is, you know, as a black man standing here looking at these statistics and a co--sitting in a county that is wealthy as San Francisco, I said this is totally unacceptable.  And so my co-chair and I said to each other, we can't let this continue, we have to do something about this.  I was still working then.  So we said we were gonna establish, we, we were gonna get some African American health leaders together to talk about this problem as to why was this going on?  Because it's not that we don't have the facilities here, and so access became an issue but, more importantly we, as African Americans pinpointed to one of the big issues was trust.  African Americans didn't trust the healthcare system and it was not without reason.  If you go back to the Tuskegee in--experiment [Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment] that they did on black men with syphilis, and the last of them died about a year or two ago, he was ninety-six years old.  What they did to those black men and it was, and it was our government that did it, it was the U.S. Public Health Service that did it.  I said, how can we expect African Americans who are my age and older and who have told their children about it, for them to trust the system?
Story_ID: 136562
Speaker 1: And as we talked about this, some of my white colleagues didn't even know what it [Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment] was. They didn't even know what it was.  So once they heard this, we had a all-day symposium on this and we had some African American patients to present.  We had four patients to present their experiences and it was, m--mind boggling to folks that this was hap--that this had happened to people in this day and age. And some of the things that happened to African Americans are generic problems that we have in our healthcare system, it's not limited only to them, but it's so much concentrated to African Americans.  So we established what we called the, the Disparities in Health of African Americans in San Francisco Project and, and we decided that we would not try to solve all of the problems and all the ills of African Americans because we can't.  But let's bite off something that we could have some success for. And so we chose two things, we chose prostate cancer and we chose a stroke as, as our projects and we've--prostate cancer has been our first foray and the hospital council is funding this, they've agreed to fund any care that black men need that is not covered by whatever, you know, Medicare, Medicaid, by private insurance.  If they fall through the cracks and they need coverage and they're screened through some of our programs, with this project, they've pledged up over a million dollars to, to cover them.  And, and actually, we looked at it actuarially, it's probably about ten men might fall out of the cracks of the screenings that are not covered by something, so they've stepped up to the plate to do that.  People, CEOs are far more sensitive. I see CEOs doing things in their hospitals now that they never would have done three years ago. And I wrote a CEO a note, I said, I went to a program where they're giving away money of, through their community benefit program, I said, you know, I just, I just wrote him a email, I said, I'm so proud of you and your hospital and I said, I, I--suffice it to say, this wouldn't have happened three years ago.  And we talked about some of the benefits of this program to, you know, were there benefits and people, those are the kinds of testimonials we're getting.  We have an advisory committee that made up of people from all over the community from various walks of life to advise us on whether we're doing it right.  It's kinda like the principle of the Labor Management Partnership, we're in partnership with the community and not sitting in some ivory tower trying to figure out what's best for them, we're, we're walking down this path together that's unknown and trying to get to a productive end.  So that's one of the things, it, it's not an organization but it's a project and we don't want it to become an organization we don't wanna get bureaucratic about it. We wanna go ahead and do what we think is best for the community--
Story_ID: 136563
Speaker 1: Now another thing that is going on, every weekend the two black newspapers, the hospital council funds advertorials on health and we have a number of those that have come out, we probably have, I think it's, I look at them because I'm--we have three of us that are co-chairing this project, the, the CEO of UCSF [University of California, San Francisco Medical Center] and the CEO of California Pacific [Hospital] and myself, they still wanted me to be a part of this, so I still, and I actually chair the advisory committee.  I'm, another organization that I'm involved in is the Institute on Aging in, in San Francisco [California], when I took this job I said, well, you know, I can't come to meetings anymore, it--you, you really should think about another vice president.  I'm one of the two vice presidents there and it provides aging services for, you know, skilled nursing services, adult day healthcare, Alzheimer's [disease] care, we provide financial management services for the elderly, so it's a number of things that we do, we bought the old Coronet Theater on San Francisco, and we're gonna be building a new facility for our programs there.  So that's something else I do.  I chair the Sergios [ph.] Haywood Concert Series at our church, Sergios Haywood was the minister of music at Third Baptist for, for fifty years a phenomenal musician.  The music that that choir produced was it, it was second to none including, I'd say, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, that choir, the, the music was of that caliber and we named the concert series in his honor and it was something that I think is very important that we bring--the mission of that or the, and the vision is that we would bring cultural venues of music to the community through Third Baptist Church, we've had, you know, we did this before we even had this series, but the Morehouse Glee Club [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], we've had the Fisk Jubilee Singers [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], we've had Spelman Glee Club [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] last year, we've had David Oliver who's the organist and artist-in-residence at Morehouse there, we are planning the, and Third Baptist for years has had the 'Messiah' [by George Frideric Handel] there and, so we, it, it's something real important to me that I think we continue that.  And we have all genres of music, we had the, our gospel choir, which is the Gospel Chimes, they do the concert annually in September, so that's something that I chair and I still do that. I'm an emeritus member of the board of The American Heart Association, the western states affiliate, I had been chairman of the board and, you know, my term was up and I don't have the time to give to it, but that was important to me because a number of my relatives, my grandmother died of, of congestive heart failure and I thought with the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in African Americans, that was someplace I wanted to make a contribution and I served as Chairman of the Board of Governors for two-- for two years in San Francisco on the American Heart Association and still make monetary contributions to it.  So, I-- heart disease is really killer in our community and so that's something I spend some of my time doing.
Story_ID: 136564
Speaker 1: Do you ever, you have done so much.  What do you do to relax?  Do you have hobbies, travel?
Speaker 2: I garden, I love to garden.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I rose--I raise roses, lilies, Asiatic lilies, Rubrum lilies, Stargazer lilies, Casablanca lilies, and dahlias, and you know, we, we have geraniums in our planter boxes across the front of the house on the second floor and we have them on our deck in the back along the fence, we have geraniums, that's, that's sort of our signature we have.  I hike a lot, and not nearly as much as I used to and want to, camp and I spend a hell of a lot of time with my sons.
Story_ID: 136565
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about your boys?  What are their names?
Speaker 2: I have two sons, Anthony II and Myles Thomas. Tony--Anthony II, just turned thirty this past August, and Myles is twenty-seven.  They both are, have completed their master's [degrees], Myles completed his M.B.A. [degree] at the University of San Francisco [San Francisco, California] this past August, Tony--both of them went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]. Tony didn't finish at Morehouse because of his parents [Anthony G. Wagner and Bennetta Wagner], we told him--I, I, Tony was, you know, if you're close enough to your kids you know what they're doing. You don't even have to be there if you talk to them enough.  So I knew Tony wasn't, wasn't really pulling it the way he should at Morehouse and he was having too much fun, so I had to explain to him where his b--brain, what part of his anatomy his brain w--l--resided in and where it didn't.  So I, I told Tony I said, I'm gonna be in Birmingham [Alabama] for a meeting and I'm gonna come over to Atlanta [Georgia] and we're gonna spend a weekend together.  So we walked around the lake and talked and sat down and talked, I said, against my better judgement, your par--you mot--your mother and my better judgment, we're gonna let you stay at Morehouse if your grades remained with a "B" average or more, which it had been, got his grades that May, it was 2.89, I said start packing. 'Cause I had told him, I said, we've made the transfer, we've done the transfer papers already, we didn't tear them up, but I said it's up to you, so he, I guess he didn't believe us, so we transferred him to Xavier [University] in New Orleans [Louisiana], and that's where he finished and he, he then went to Rensselaer Polytech Institute in Troy, New York, to, for his master's in, in industrial psychology and he's completed that about three or four years ago and he's a, he's a benefits specialist or analyst at a hospital in San Francisco and Myles is just the opposite of Tony and they're the best friends they, of friends, they, they have an apartment together in the Hay, it's an old, it's a Victorian they're up on the third floor, they're best buddies but they're very different.  Whereas Tony has all the, the charisma and, and sort of the play, and Myles is very quiet reserved but very observant and takes it all in. And he finished Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] in three and half years, Phi Beta Kappa [Society], he stopped and worked for a while which we probably should have let Tony do and, because Tony didn't have the discipline, we just said go right on and get that master's.  He worked a while and he, he then said, yeah, I'm ready to go and do it now and so we said to him since we didn't have to pay for anything for you, he had a, he had, he also had a four year room and board and tuition scholarship to Morehouse and as I said, he completed it in three and half years.  So since we didn't have to really pay for anything except for giving you some spending money, it's on us, your masters so, you know, we held true to our promise and, and so he's out looking for a job now, he, he, he's working hard trying to get, make that happen and it, and I told him this morning, 'cause he, he was over to our house before I left, I said what are you doing here so early?  He said, well I do this every morning, he said, 'cause he, our--my computer is stronger and it has more bells and whistles, he wants to use our computer, but he's out looking for his job and they will call me, you know they call me during the week all the time and I love it.  Myles called me yesterday, I was in the middle of a meeting here, I said, "Well, son I'll call you back," I said, "Well, what is it about?" He said, "Well, I'm cooking dinner for a, a young lady and I wanted to get your, your idea of what kind of menu I should have, he said because she doesn't eat meat and I wanted some thoughts." I said, "Well I'll call you back."  Or they'll call me, "Dad what are you doing this Saturday, let's, let's go to breakfast." Or they'll come over and we'll watch--they, they bought me, for Christmas, the whole collection of 'The Simpsons' episodes, I love the 'The Simpsons' so we'll watch 'The Simpsons' together or we'll watch 'The Blues Brothers' together or 'Doctor Detroit,' we love comedy and Bennie's [Bennetta Wagner] a nurse, a night nurse so, and she works Monday night through Friday night and some, and she works charge, so she can't do some things, sometimes with me unless I let her know plenty of time.
Story_ID: 136566
Speaker 1: And so we're a benefactor of our museums, so we get sort of some perks, and one of the perks is that we get to see the museum before it opens to the public. So I called them, I said, "Hey guys, come on you wanna--come on go to the museum opening with me this Thursday." So Tony [Wagner's son, Anthony G. Wagner, II] said of course, he said he was going, so Myles [Wagner's son, Myles Wagner] said, "I don't know, we wanna talk about it."  I said, "What it there to talk about?"  I said, "I'm your dad and I want you to go with me." And so he said, "Well, why dad?"  I said, "Because."  I said, "You may, who knows you may meet some, so--some folks who might can help you with a job and I said it's, it's a good cultural experience."  He said, "Well, I go to museums on my own," and I'm sure they, he, he would, but I said, "I want you to go with me."  So we're all going to the museum opening this Thursday.
Speaker 2: Which is?  (Unclear)
Speaker 1: The de Young Museum in San Francisco [California].  We've rebuilt--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the museum and it's fantastic, I've seen some of it.  It's just a fabulous thing.  But they--we--we'll go out, and we--we'll go to, it's a sale, annual clothing sale for a store, we'll, we go to this thing together and, one of the traditions we have after Thanksgiving meal is to go down to the auto show, oh so we, we do that.  And one year we, we weren't gonna have Christmas dinner, 'cause it, it's a big deal at our house, we have goose 'cause my grandmother always had goose, so we have goose, you know, I do all the cooking, so we didn't have it and they, they were absolutely--we weren't gonna have it and they said, what?  We're not gonna have a feast?  That's a tradition, what's the matter with you folks.  So we, we saw then how this had become a tradition with them and they--invite all their friends and we usually have about thirty people in the house 'cause we have some friends and relatives that come too.  But they're, they're real good guys.
Speaker 2: Sounds like you--
Speaker 1: Good guys.
Speaker 2: --have a wonderful relationship.
Story_ID: 137191
Speaker 1: You--we just finished talking about your sons, you're a very young man, you have done a lot, you've accomplished a lot, but I know you have, there's a lot of time left, had, do you have any things that you would like to do, that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think after this stint at Kaiser [Family Foundation], what I would like to do is, probably keep this house in San Francisco [California] but, but buy or build another house.  Wha--what I'd really love to do and my wife [Bennetta Mitchell Wagner] says absolutely no part of it, I'd like to have a house up on the river in Grafton [Illinois], which is in--near Alton [Illinois] and she doesn't want to go back.
Story_ID: 137192
Speaker 1: I was asking you about your--things you would like to do in the future, you had mentioned you want to build a house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, either build or buy a house that's, well I tell my wife [Bennetta Mitchell Wagner] it's a California house, that it's one level it's, you know, it's rambling it has lots of glass and I, I'd like to have a greenhouse and do some hybridizing of plants and travel.
Speaker 1: Any particular places?
Speaker 2: Probably to, s--so--we plan to spend a month in, in Africa for our thirty-fifth wedding anniversary, so we would have, we would have gotten submerged I think, into Africa.  But also, we, we can do some more traveling in the United States, there are a lot of places to go here, I would, I would like to go to Savannah [Georgia], I would like to see some of Appalachia, some of the, more of the east coast, we go to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] every summer, we've been doing that for probably the last twelve years, so this is the first year we haven't gone in like twelve years so, do that.  But also other countries, to see some more of Europe, go--I very much want to go, a must do on my list is to go back to Vietnam now and to see it out of war, because it was some of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen where there.  I'd like to go back to, they'd like to go to Da Lat [Vietnam], which is the mountainous area there, it was beautiful, but go back to Nha Trang [Vietnam] where we were, where I was stationed, I would like to do that, go to New Zealand, we have a very close friend who lives there and see that and see the Mori people--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --who, who live there as well.  Perhaps also Australia, so there's lot's to be done and hopefully one day have some grandkids that I can dote on and do what my grandparents did best with me.  I tell my sons that one of the regrets I have is that they didn't have, they didn't live close enough to their grandparents that they could see them frequently.  I would go by my grandparents' house everyday on my way home from school, from high school I'd go by, 'cause I'd walk and just go by and, and just rub up against them, just be in the house.  So those, those are some of the things I'd like to do.
Story_ID: 137193
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you want us--to tell me about?  I know you'd mentioned your grandparents.
Speaker 2: I guess the one thing I want tell you, what I think it also tells you more about who I am, it's about my maternal grandmother's family, the Donaldsons.  The Donaldsons, is, the history that we know or the early, say the middle 1800's, around 1858, my great grandfather John Donaldson [ph.] was a slave and he, he had, he had, oh I forgot how many brothers, I know Frank was one of his brothers, but he had, he had four sisters and his mother and, and the family was split up, the, the people who owned them was King, their last name was Kings and Donaldsons but, they, these two white families lived close enough together and they were related that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: This was in Arkansas?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: In, in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Alabama.
Speaker 2: --That both of these families were close enough that they still, the slaves still functioned as a family.  Well, when they were freed, they, they were, my, my grandfather, great grandfather took his sisters with him and, and his brother went, went, I don't know where he went, but he took his sister and his mother and his sisters with him and they moved to, no they're still in Ark--they were still in Decatur, Alabama and then he c--he, he married a woman, I don't know her last name, but her last name was M--her first name was Emily [ph.], and they had four children. They had Sadie [ph.], Dorothy [ph.], Frank [ph.] and Dan [ph.] and Emily [ph.] died during childbirth with s--with Dorothy I believe and before she died, she asked my [great] grandfather, John, "So, I would like you to ask Francis Cannon to marry you, she, she was my classmate at Tuskegee [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and I think she would, she would be, she would be more likely to take care of my four children like they were her own."  So he did, and she said yes.  So they got married and his mother had died and her mother was living, Lou Cannon and I have pictures of these people actually from my great aunt, 'cause I asked my great aunt, would she, the one that's remaining of the family, I'll tell you about this.  Anyway, they had sixteen children, one of which was my grandmother, Bessie [ph.], I think she was one of the last of them that was born in Arkansas, in Decatur.  In the meantime, what had happened, L--Lou, Francis Cannon [ph.], whom he married, her mother, Lou Cannon remarried and the man that she married raped his youngest sister, Dolly [ph.], my great grandfather killed this guy for this.  His brother Frank, I think it was Frank, wrote to him and said, "Why don't you come to Arkansas, it's safer and it's work here." So the whole family moved to Arkansas and that's how they got to Arkansas.  Now out of that family, I didn't know f--until I was in high school, a senior in high school, that there was a difference, that there, there was the first four and then the sixteen, they never talked about it, they always functioned as they were whole sisters and brothers.  And the way I found out was my cousin who was the son of one of the first four and was a mortician in Pine Bluff [Arkansas] for the last fifty years and he, he since deceased, but he's probably buried everybody who had died between Hot Springs [Arkansas] and Pine Bluff for fifty years.  His wife who was, I don't know she was just, not--but, but it was the truth to I guess.  The way she had written up the obituary it had this there and, it, it, it had this explanation in it and my great aunts and uncles, they cried more about that than they did his mot--they were at his mother's funeral, that's how it, it was revealed.  They cried more about it being publicly told that they were half brothers and sisters then they did about her death, they--it, and so it says a lot about the, the bonds in the family.  The first family reunion was held thirty-five years ago, thirty-four years ago in Pine Bluff and my cousin, this cousin I just mentioned who was a mortician, he funded the thing and 435 people showed up.  So we, we have had reunions every year except one year it was a mix up and we've tried to go to have them like every other year and this, the one, s--the last sibling now who's left is my Aunt Alnitia [ph.] who is ninety-two, says every year, well I may not be hear the next years so we have to have it, so we ha--have it.  So we just had a family meeting at our reunion, we had a reunion in Miami [Florida] this year and we voted that we would have reunions near Alton [Illinois] until she de--dies, so it'll be easier for her to get there.  So, that's, that's the story.  And, and, you know, out of that, we have [HM] Jeff Donaldson who was the chairman of the, of the liberal arts department at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and is a great artist in his own right.  That's where the Wall of Respect was, he, he did this in Chicago [Illinois], he just died, I know they had the memorial service at Howard last March, March a year ago and my cousin Rose [ph.] who owns her own opt, opt-- optician shop, but it the, you can just go through the family and people, their successes of this family and how close we are.  So that was the story I wanted to tell you about the Donaldsons.
Speaker 1: Okay good--
Story_ID: 137194
Speaker 1: I think you had also mentioned early, you wanted to tell me some more about your church?
Speaker 2: It, it's just that, what I wanted to tell you about the church, I think I've told you about it is that it's the indelible imprint that is left on me and, and a lot of us who, who are a part of that and, and, and, so, it, it's no surprise that wherever I am, usually if it's on a Sunday, I, I'm at somebodies church, you know we were at a--Abyssinian [Baptist] Church in [Harlem] New York Sunday, Adam Clayton Powell's father's [Adam Clayton Powell, Sr.] church that he established and we were at Ebenezer [Baptist Church], I was at Ebenezer down in Atlanta [Georgia] when we were there, I feel that's a part of my life, I, I'm trying to make sure my sons feel that way and, I'm sure they will, they do, they don't go as often as we would like them, but they'll--the base is there.
Story_ID: 137195
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as, this is a guy who loved life, loved people and made a difference.
