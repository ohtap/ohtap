My vacation is like my house, go to Naperville [Illinois], to Comiskey Park, to (unclear) or closer to, and Clark and Eddy, and here to my house.  And sometimes, you know, my wife, my kid, we go on a boat.  We a little--no little big boat now.  We have a little boat, and now she just--and the best day, she just run it, and she say, okay, and we have a big boat, and she is the captain.  She's the one to drive the boat, like (unclear) drove the car.  And I just watch it.  I watch it.  I like it a little bit, but, you know, I let--she drive it.  She's a good driver.  And she know everything about the boat.  And I had to learn, and she had to teach me.  That's my, that's my, my hobby.  My hobby is not to, like in going out of town, different city for quite a while now.  This year I do a little bit more because, you know, we went to San Diego [Califronia]--we went to San Diego not too long ago.  My, my daughter live there, and she (unclear) a new house, she bought it.  And we went up there, spent a week with--we went to over there--what you call this place?

Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The time of the year, well, to me, anytime, that's a good time.  I go along with anything God's sending.  But I like the medium, I no like the hot, hot weather.  And so I come from a hot country, but I've been here for so long till I just get used to anything the country have.  So I been here in Chicago [Illinois] for almost fifty years.  And I just learn anything, the climate and the way to handle myself, everything this city produce (unclear), I like.  I like the people.  I love the people, that's the main thing.  And seem like the people give me energy, life, ambition to live day by day, and love it show them day-by-day and more and more no matter who they are, what nationalities, what races or what position, I love it.  And it seems like it's part of my whole family.  This, this my way.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, truly, I like the sentimental music.  And I used to be a good friend, the few--like Nat King Cole used to be my friend, like a buddy, Sarah Vaughn, she was my sweetheart.  So I remember the champion, Joe Louis, and myself, we used to have a, we used to have a--tease each other, I said, Joe, leave her alone.  And he used to tell her, hey, Sarah Vaughan, he don't know how to speak English.  Why do you like him?  She said, Joe, I like the kid.  He's a nice kid.  You have so many girlfriend, so I'm Minnie's girlfriend, you know, Sarah Vaughan.  She said, what do you like me to sing for you, my boyfriend?  And I used to tell, "Over the Rainbow", you know.  And her--I used to--good friend to Mr. Billy Eckstein.  So a lot of those guys, they used to come over there on the South Side because that's where I used to live--.
Speaker 1: Billy Eckstein?
Speaker 2: Sure, all of those guys.  Mr. B.  So anytime they come to Chicago, I was there, and (unclear) every time he come to Chicago would sit over here, in the box seat closer to the dugout.  And he would just say, hey, Minos.  I said, what, now, what can I do?  Can I have one baseball?  I said, sure, as many as you want.  I mean, and later on, I made it, (unclear), and I love and respect, that was June Christian, cause she used to sing this song, "Tinkcoo" (ph.).  Ah, they used to kill me with that.  So a lot of, lot of good singing.
Speaker 1: Okay, but do you have a favorite saying, favorite saying, a favorite phrase? A slogan? A slogan or motto that you use?
Speaker 2: Well, truly, I don't have a word together to tell you this is one or this, you know.  Before maybe, I misunderstand a little bit, and I might went too off by your question.
Story_ID: 56373
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's talk about your early years.  You were born in Cuba, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you were born in what year was it?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) I said, November 29, 1925.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my mother said, by this time--I was born in the day, on Wednesday, but (unclear), she can't--she's not here to tell me, yeah, exactly.  But to some people who write, they no, you were born in twenty-two.  You born in the twenty, so, but I just tell her look, you, you was not my mother because one guy, he got a little bit excited.  He said, nah, you were born in 1920.  I said, I think he was newspaper, and I'm not gonna mention the name, but I just gonna say what I just thought of.  I said, look, you with my mother?  You held me nine months in your stomach?  Minnie, why did you say that?  I said, well, because you just try to change my name, you try to change the date of birth like if you was the one to birth me.  No, my mother birthed me on November 29, 1925, and this is what I write.  So I don't care if you said, I'm hundred, two hundred, but this is the way they are.
Speaker 1: So these sports writers have said that you were born earlier?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he said, that, well, I said, what?  So what can I get?  I don't have to take any--I don't got anything to, to take, one, two, three year away from me.  For what?  I lie to myself.  I don't lie to the people.  (Unclear) I lie to myself
Speaker 1: That seems to happen a lot.  These sports casters or sports writers will say that somebody like, say, Luis Tiant, (unclear) said that he was born--they didn't know when he was born, and he might be way older than what he was, and, one--you know, but I don't know what difference it makes.  You know, why they would say that (unclear) (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Why, I don't know because this, I believe, this is the schedule that they play.  This is the way they write it.  This is the way they believe.  Just like some time they just try to give--think, and they might say, I'm gonna guess.  And they want to be right all the time.  I say, okay, if they right, they right.  I'm not criticize.  And I said, one thing, said, well, wait a minute.  How do you criticize--I never see, one of the problem because they asking me some question about one of the players.  And I said, now, wait a minute.  I'm not entitled to criticize any players.  Why?  Because I was a player too.  I played baseball too.  And this is my profession and they profession.  I respect it.  Whatever, if I don't like it, I save to myself.  This is like a private business.  And I remember in baseball, they used to say--the manager used to say, fellow whatever, whatever you do here, whatever happen here, when you get out of here, it stay here.  So it's like, you know, the business is secret and everything, you don't give it away.  If you do that, you a traitor.  So, and I said, you want me to criticize, so why don't you criticize--how come you no criticize yourself.  You make a mistake like anybody else, right?  So, he said, yes.  I said, how come you no criticize yourself?  You criticize somebody else, but you no criticize yourself.  To be perfect, you have to first, you look at yourself, and after that, you look at somebody else.  Whatever you don't like for yourself, you be sure, you don't give it to somebody else.  So, but it's life.
Story_ID: 56374
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your father's name and what was his occupation?  And can you tell me something about your family background?  What were they--?
Speaker 2: Well, truly, we--my father was a ranch man.  I'm not gonna sit up here and tell you my father, he used to have a million dollar, two million dollar, no, we're not.  So we used to live like a regular family.  We working, decent to make a living.  And my father used to work on the ranch.  He used to raise the cow and pork, chicken, you know, you know, we--and raise it, and planted a lot of corn, rice, beans.  I mean this is the way we grew up.
Speaker 1: Were you born in Havana?  I read you were born in Havana?
Speaker 2: Right, no.  I'm not this kind of guy who used to say--everybody used to come from there, oh, I born in Havana.  No, no.  So, by this time it was seven million people, seven or eight--between seven, eight--(low--the eight.  And everybody who comes here, no, I born in Havana.  So if we had seven million people in Cuba by this time, and everybody born in Havana, so who going to live in Oriente, Camaguey, Santa Clara, Pinar del Rio and Santiago.  And Santi--I mean and, and Havana.  So, no, I born in Perico.  That's about a hundred seventy five kilometers from Havana.  That's make it like, perhaps sixty something mile from Havana.  This is where I was born.
Speaker 1: Can you spell the name of that town?
Speaker 2: Perico, it's P-E-R-I-C-O, Perico.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So, Matanzas, so this is where I was born.  And for that, come to Havana.  And I stayed in Havana.  I used to have two sisters to live in Havana.  They have work in Havana.  So I stayed with her, and I fell in love with Havana because before I no like to stay in the big city.  I used to miss the ranch, the bull, the cows, I used to ride with cows, break in a cow and breaking in horses.
Story_ID: 56375
Speaker 1: And, yeah, you were talking about helping out on the ranch.
Speaker 2: Right, so, and after that I used to help a few guy to have a obligation with (unclear) a father and to working.  So I used to go over there and help to anyone, to needed to be free, like a Saturday and Sunday that we play.  So if he--they do the duty, they'd be able to go over there and play.  And I was the manager of the team, and I was the guy that built the team.  And I used to be the pitching manager and they all listened to me.  We was young, maybe about twelve, thirteen years old.  And this is what, thirteen to fourteen.  So I used to be the leader.  And so then I would say, wait a minute, everything that you try and for your interests, you make it.  You never listen to make it to the time you find it out your own self.  And those guys used to follow me.  They said, we have started to play the game, to the time, I remembered the one guy told me, look, Minnie, (unclear), I think if I was you, you giving up being, pitching.  I said, why?  Said, because you see you have a good arm.  You're a good hitter, you're a good runner, you're a good fielder, and you intelligent.  You're the best young kid playing the whole country here.  And I said, gee, what is--you know why?  I said, no, because, you know, you can go high.  But if you stay pitching, and you hurt your arm, and if--to come back, it's gonna be tough.  In [on] the other hand, if you play a different position, you can be a (unclear) (loaner?), and you can be, play as long as you want to.  And you strong, and you're a good hitter.  That's okay, I'm gonna pitch those two games.  Then I have to face those guys.  And after that, I give it up.  So those teams, they used to beat my team when I went to Havana because my mother would pass, and I went to Havana, and I stayed there one month or two.  And my team play against those two teams, and they beat (unclear) ('em?).  And they started making fun out of it, they say, oh, we (unclear) come back.  So when I come back, I say what happened.  They said, they beat us.  I said, well, great, we (unclear).  So I went over there the first thing, I beat it, thirteen to one.  And the second team we beat it, five to three.  And I said, that's it.  I retire like a pitcher, and I used to come out and play third base.  And that's what I used to come out later on, third base to the time I come to the big leagues.  And they changed me to play, Cleveland to left field.
Story_ID: 56376
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were a kid, when you were small, did you go to school in--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I used to go, at school to a place about two, two mile away from the ranch.  So I have to walk over there and the place we were in, there was something like a sugar factory.  That's where they make the sugar.  Most of those, this factory, the big, there used to American owner.  So we have a beautiful town over there, built beautiful town.  So, but we used to come out from the ranch, there was maybe about half an hour walk, and if we run it would make it fifteen minute run.  And we used to go to school over there.  But, you know, to be in high, high school, you had to be in Matanzas or Havana, it's a big city.  So when you're on the ranch, you cannot go too deep.  So if you want to go to high school, you have to go to the big city.  And we used to get to eighth grade, and after that you have to go into the, to the big private school.  If you have the position to go, you can make it, you just have to go--how longer would you go, to maybe eighth grade, ninth grade.
Story_ID: 56377
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us about your mother?  What was her name again?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother, there was Celia, Cecilia, Cecilia B. Armas, it was Cecilia Arrieta.  When she married my daddy, Cecilia Arrieta Armas.  So she was a beautiful lady.  It's funny.  She don't know how to read it and she don't know how to write, but she express herself so beautiful.  And you would not be able to fool her, of one penny in the money because she know.  If you try to fool one penny of the counting, she'd say, now, wait a minute.  You need one penny here.  So those kind of instinct, God gave it sometime to somebody. She was very sweet.  And everybody would love it when she would talk because I think--and in the beginning I was mad, you know she used to be tough with me.  But I used to be this kind of kid, I have a lot of pepper, jump in the bed and a lot of decision.  But nothing bad.  Like have any kind of harm, knife, no.  So I used to be like nothing was impossible.  You're gonna get (unclear) some time.  You don't supposed to be there.  I said, I want to try.  If you're afraid, you never know.  So, but she used to be tough.  When I do something wrong, she used to whip me good, good.  So when my father [Carlos Arrieta] come out, I used to take it for granted because my father never hit.  I used to be (unclear) little baby.  And she said, as soon as our daddy come out, that's why you start to be a little bit tough.  So I got news for you--she scared me because she used to say, if you no behave yourself, I'm gonna put you in the military school.  That's like in jail.  And I was scared a little bit, you know.  I make the best kid in the last--in two, three, four, five days.  After that, I'd start over again.  But, no bad, you know, not that I offend anybody.  I always respected the, the old people.  I always protected the justice if somebody bigger try to be tough on the young, I used to take over, even so, if he--they beat the devil of me.  But I used to get it myself to protect the other friend or the other kid.  And I still do the same all my life.  And I think that's the way it's gonna be till when I leave.  And I can't help it, so.
Story_ID: 56378
Speaker 1: I just wanted you to comment on what life was like in Cuba in the 1920s and what things--I mean what were the social issues there, what were the political issues in Cuba because people over here don't really know, you know, what life was like in Cuba then or now, as a matter of fact?
Speaker 2: Well, truly, I have to go a little bit farther of the '20s [1920s] because I was born in '25 [1925].
Speaker 1: Twenty five [1925], yeah.
Speaker 2: So I have to go--.
Speaker 1: Into the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But truly, anywhere you go, you used to find it out--how do you call, a little bit misunderstand between each other.  But sometime like we have in Cuba, I used to go out on the ranch, and I would see many, many (unclear) stuff, believe, like some people, they used to be separated.  And they--no, I born on the ranch, together, everyone.  We together, we working together, and we're just living together.  We used to have a house in the ranch and everybody together.  And one house here, maybe about twenty, forty feet away from the other.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the different races?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  So, but (unclear) I never seen much.  But everywhere you would go, always they have a, this kind of misunderstand.  But in Cuba, they used to have a low, low, low--they say, you not supposed to be there, no.  You have maybe the right to accept whatever you want to accept.  So you have a lot of club.  If it was club, before, you know, and if you not a member, you not allowed to get in.  So we used to have a member club.  It's everyone has a club.  They said, if you a member of this club, you'll be able to go.  If you're not a member, you'll not be able to go.
Speaker 1: Okay, but there weren't any laws that said that you couldn't--.
Speaker 2: No, no law.
Speaker 1: --do this or you couldn't do that?
Speaker 2: No, no, no law that can say, you are black.  You cannot go wherever you want.  No, no.  But you (unclear).  If you have a club, and (unclear) have a--(unclear).  The black have a club.  And they have a club, and you're a member, you cannot go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the practice sometimes was discriminatory, even though the laws--.
Speaker 2: Right, sure.  But, you know, but I never pay any attention to that because when I came to U.S., well, you just went along with the law.  It never bothered me.  I just thought it never bothered me because you come to Chicago [Illinois], you could go everywhere you wanted.  In New York [City, New York] and different places, Boston [Massachusetts], but I never even look there.  So finally I was playing baseball in the big leagues.  I used to play in different places, and I hear a lot of names, a lot of things they call, but it's no bother me.  So I learned the respect of the law everywhere I go.  I believe if he--I don't like the law in one place, so if this not my place, I stay away from it.  If you respect, you having no problem.  So, now, you see.  I no like to even bring the past because whatever happened in the past, is past.
Story_ID: 56379
Speaker 1: So I'm congratulated two people, Mr. Brown Rick and Mr. Jackie Robinson.
Speaker 2: [Wesley] Branch Rickey?
Speaker 1: And Jackie Robinson.  That's the two people that if you look at--I'm this kind of guy, I look and figure out, even probably I know they're big guys, these two guy, but in my mind, it's very clear.  And I compare.  When I saw those two hand shake, to me, that says, you see, those two people bring the two races together.  What is, above (unclear) two hands, you see a black hand, a white hand, shake.  Who (unclear)?  Mr. Branch Rick to take the opportunity, decision to have a, a black play in a, in a national league in America.  And Mr. Jackie who decided to represent the black league and shake.  And I think they were two great guy[s].  They no talk much about it, but to me that was a great picture, great two-hand shake.  Like I said, we are friend, to the end.  And look at what happened.
Story_ID: 56380
Speaker 1: Now, now, in Cuba, now, baseball was the most popular sport in Cuba, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Baseball used to be very great.  Baseball, music and boxing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, baseball came when the Americans, I guess went over there in the 1890s, I guess--Cuba had, from what I understand Cuba had slavery till about 1895 or so.  And then after the Spanish American War, the United States--.
Speaker 2: They used to go up there and play.  Yeah, and so Baby [Babe] Ruth and other greats.  The team who won the World Series here, they used to go up there and play in Cuba a few games, but I heard that the Cuban team, they was very good.  And they lose a few time, and later on they stopped to go and, after they won the World Series or something, to play there.  So they discontinued.  The reason I don't know, but, yeah, there was--baseball used to be ambition everyone.  But they used to have four ball club, four ball club, and those four ball club, naturally.  So you, lucky if you had the opportunity and make it.
Speaker 1: You said there were four--?
Speaker 2: Baseball teams.
Speaker 1: Baseball teams in Cuba.
Speaker 2: We used to have Havana Red, (unclear) Blue, Cienfuego, and Marianao (ph.).  Marianao is the team I was play--all my life, about fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Can you spell the name of that team?
Speaker 2: Marianao, Marianao, it's called the tiger, Marianao Tigers.  So this is the name of the one suburb.
Speaker 1: Yeah, can you spell that name for?
Speaker 2: Marianao?
Speaker 1: Marianao.
Speaker 2: M-A-R-I-A-N-O [sic, M-A-R-I-A-N-A-O]
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Marianao.  This is the team I was playing.
Story_ID: 56381
Speaker 1: So and truly, my dream in this just to be able to play professional in Cuba.  This was what was my dream.  That's all.  I never thought I can be, play anywhere.  It's just my ambition first, that was, when I was a kid, to meet the United States, but not like to play baseball or not--just to meet the United States.  I used to have ambition because I have a kid who father used to be one of the big general manager of the Central Espana.  So he lived a little bit close to the chalet.  We used to have a chalet, big house.  And I used to live close.  So--and we used to play together.  And there, used to Billy.  I said, Billy, someday I want to be in United States.  He said, maybe someday we take you over there.  And a few year later, I happened to--I 'come a professional in Havana, and I come to the United States, but I refused at first to go to Mexico.  That's where they wanted me.  Go to Mexico to play for one of the Mexican team.  The owner was a Mr. Alehandro Pascal, rest in peace.  So they offer me about thirty thousand dollar--I never see this in my life.  And by this time, I never see a hundred dollar bill.  And he opened a bag over there, and he said, I give you thirty thousand dollars right now.  I'll put the money here in the bank in Cuba if you come over here and play in Mexico for me for Tampico baseball team.  And the manager, the manager here in this team over here now, Amando Marsans.  I said, no, I going to the United States.  He said, you gonna go to United States, over there, they racists.  I say, that's not bothering me.  They have humans there too, they have black over there too.  I'm (unclear) black.  I'll be there.  I'm gonna go.  And I come into the United States for a hundred fifty dollar a month to play with the New York Cubans.  So I have the opportunity, I would play in the polo ground--.
Speaker 2: This is the Cuban ex-Giants.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, the New York Cubans.
Speaker 2: New York Cubans, okay.
Story_ID: 56382
Speaker 1: It was Alex Pompey used to be the owner.  And I used to play in the polo ground and I used to play in the Yankee stadium with the best dressed Latin in the whole America in the bush league.  They used to have a national league, a American League.  I was American League.  We used to dress exactly the same uniform of the New York Giants, they used to wear.  They ordered the same for us.  And we used to have the same letters, same type of uniform and the same, described the New York Giant way.  So we play in New York for those teams, with those uniforms because while you were going on the road, we used to be visiting, everywhere we're going on the road, visiting.  We have a gray uniform, exactly like in New York.  And the gray like, the other one, exactly like New York Giants.  And now--.
Speaker 2: You had pinstripes and all--?
Speaker 1: Right, it's like, and now this is San Francisco [California], yeah.  So, and I remember that later on when Jackie [Robinson] breaking in, so we already had Warren (ph.) Beason (ph.).  He was in the minor leagues, (unclear) he was breaking in (unclear).  He come to--so everybody say, now, wait a minute, Jackie there.  I think the, you know, we can make it too.  So, and everybody tried to, you know, try harder and harder (unclear) to the time.  So we lucky we made it.  So I'm so proud of the day I was make it, but I'm very happy.  So I signed up with Cleveland [Indians], and I was twenty-second in (unclear) New York so that Chicago [Illinois], whenever they called, we up there.  He sign (unclear), but when I first tried, I tried with the St. Louis Cardinals.  And some place out at United--out of New York.  And Jose Santiago, who was a Puerto Rican guy, he called Pantalones Santiago, he was a pretty good pitcher.  He liked a lot of races, you know, he liked a lot of racing, he liked the racing track, but, you know, he a--he's a tough kid, good kid.  His father, you know, was a doc--dent--doctor, he have it pretty good, economical way.  So, you know, he missed a lot of game or something, and he this kind of kid that he just no take too much from nobody.  He tell the truth right away to anybody.  So, but he was a good ball player.  We went over there and work out and the manager told me there was a rookie kid, (unclear) to not throw it too hard because the kid might hurt.  I said, no, wait a minute, if I no throw from third base to first base too hard, I want to show what I have it, that's what I'm here.  Why do you bring me in?  So Santiago struck out two in a row, three, so we all (unclear) (in this group?).  So he no say, well, you ready, we gonna sign it.  So they called Pompey, and they say well, look, you have to go over there, next month, the next couple of weeks in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], some place in Milwaukee to try.  And we said, no, we no go.  Why?  I said, we no go because we already show here we are way ahead of this kid, and now we have to go into different place to try it again?  I say, no.  We no go, we no went.  So, and about a couple of weeks later, the Cleveland come up after the All-Star game, then we come here and play in Chicago, All-Star game, national against the American league and the Negro league.  So they sign us.  Santiago and sign myself and we went to Dayton [Ohio].

Speaker 1: In Dayton, Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you played in what, Hudson Field in Dayton?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  So that's your hometown?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's a good place because that's the fast organized baseball I ever played when the beginning.  And I hit a .525 in one month.  So I never forget that, .525.  I was played third base.  I make one error.  I never forget.  And I hit one homerun like this, and this, the homerun, I hit it over there in your hometown, in Dayton, we was behind three to nothing.  The bases was loaded, you have a "3-0".  And the manager, he's used to be Busby (ph.), Busby, Buckley (ph.). He used to be one of the third base for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Retired, he was a manager.  He give me (unclear).  But to those guys, you see, I don't know how to speak a word well in English, still I don't know, but I do the best--better now than before.  And they say, hit it.  And I swing it, and I hit it out of the ballpark.  And we went ahead four to, four to one--four to three.  So I think later on we lost it again, whatever happened (unclear).  So that's what happened so I never forget.
Story_ID: 56384
Speaker 1: And you, you were in Dayton in the minor leagues [with the Dayton Indians] and hit five hundred--.
Speaker 2: Five hundred and twenty five.
Speaker 1: Five twenty five, and you were talking about a game where you hit a home run--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I told you where I hit a homerun and we have it 3-0, bases loaded, and they told me, take it, and I swing it because [Jose] Santiago, he used to say, hey, "take it" to me in Spanish, (speaking Spanish).  So in English, take it, that's not swing, just let it go, take it to yourself, but not to swing it.  And I confused it, and Santiago said, swing.  I swing and hit him right side the head--.
Speaker 1: They were trying to tell you to take the pitch 'cause was it was three balls to no strikes?
Speaker 2: The, the, the coach.  The (unclear) passed it to the coach and the coach (unclear) take it, but they holler at me from the dugout, (Spanish], he say (Spanish), swing in Spanish, so I swing it, you know, you see, homerun.  So when I get in, everybody, oh, nice play.  So after the manager, he was (unclear) said, look, you no, no swing, take it. I said, well, they told me to take it in Spanish, (Spanish) to swing it, and they told me--he said, no, no, no.  He said, look, (unclear) no do that because he no belong to this league.  He's gonna be in the big league in no time.  Right now, he ready to be there; yeah he gonna have a problem.  So, no, you, you no do right, if you heard it, he's just trying to confuse you.  (Unclear) He help us, he had to swing it, let him swing it.  He don't supposed to take it here.  He kill everybody here, you know, kill every pitcher here.  He said, no, we no--the manager said, no.  I don't want it there.  We want to hit--to learn how to play the game.  If we win or do, we hurt because you're gonna go over there and gonna be miserable, gonna have a problem.  So this is story that what happened in Dayton, when I was in Dayton.  They used to call it Central league.
Story_ID: 56385
Speaker 1: And I have another thing to say to you, I remember we was going up there one--play one, I think it was in Waukegan [Wisconsin].  So we--I couldn't stay in the same hotel with (unclear).  (Unclear) and they said, I have to stay in--with the black family.  They call, and they have it already, (unclear) basically, one room for me to stay in the house.  And I stay in the bus.  The bus gonna--they loaded the bus with the bag of the players, and I stay in the bus.  And the guy who he loaded is a bat boy, he say, hey, I heard you got to have a--he told the chauffer, you have a black, black ball boy.  He said, black ball boy, no, we don't have no black ball boy.  We have a black player, one of the best in the league.  He say, you kidding.  He said, come over there and see it tonight.  So he drop me over there, and he told me about it, and I said, nah, it's okay.  So that day I was four for four.  I think it was in Indiana where we played.  And I said, (unclear) (hold it?), and in Waukegan, I went over there to Chinese place.  I was staying in the same hotel.  And I went up there to--I ordered fried rice and pepper steak.  I used to like that still.  And the China told me, you have to eat in the kitchen, and I said, no, I don't go to eat in the kitchen because I just gonna take it to the hotel with me.  And I said, but you told me that I have to eat in the kitchen, and where do you eat?  You supposed to eat at a table if you say you have to eat in the kitchen, in a table cause you're black too.  And I turned around, and I laughed.  So all these people don't never have anything to hurt me.  I always laugh this, and I still laugh at this.  That's pretty good experience.
Story_ID: 56386
Speaker 1: And truly I recommend to everyone, every youngster, first to stay in school.  No quit school, and stay off drugs and stay off of gangs.  I respect anyone who already involved with drugs because they respect me.  I cannot say anything against anybody being drunk, anybody be involved with a lot of this stuff.  No one ever hurt me and no one ever mis-respect me.  No matter if they do whatever they do, I'm not the law to go over there and, no, this guy, no, no, no.  If I was the law, okay.  But I teach everybody, no matter what they do, say, hi, how you doing?  So I always travel alone.  I respect everybody, and they respect me, whatever they do, they got my respect.  But I just tell the youngsters not to be included and I hope they--whatever they do, if they go off, go ahead, but not try to mess around with those kids because those, be the future, human to go and driving the right people, the country.  If we try to have those just involved in something that we can't stop it now, we might be guilty because you--we try to mess around with the kid's life (unclear).  That's my philosophy and that's what I be doing.  I went to a lot of schools, and sometimes I cry because I have letters, every grade, was second, third, fourth, five, six grades, those kids write me a beautiful letter because I go over there and make a speech in every class.  And when I go the second time, they wait for me.  They come and hug me, "Minnie, we love you, we like what you say".  I make a speech, and so I met a beautiful (blonde?) girl, this height (demonstrates with hand), five, six years.  She cry and the boy cried.  I said, excuse me, and she raise her eyes, say Mr. Minoso, I'm sorry, I no cry because you say anything wrong.  You hurt my deep, inside of my heart, the way you say to get together and love and respect each other and stay off of everything bad.  Do not lie to your mother.  Tell the truth, not to (unclear) respect the school, respect your teachers.  And she said, yeah, I'm Catholic too and this is why I cry.  But we love you.  I said, okay, thank you.  I mean all those things make me thing that I have to, will have to live longer and longer to go over there and talk to those kids and give my ideas to those kids.  I think it helps and helping me to, this part of my life.
Story_ID: 56387
Speaker 1: Can you tell me, when you started playing, who were some of the there players from Cuba that came over with you?
Speaker 2: Well, truly, one of the first--I'm the first, I'm the only one that come along on my team.  So I come to Chicago [Illinois], and--because I used to be with Cleveland [Indians], but from Cuba, didn't have anyone to play by this time, the big league, that have to come with me.  They have a different guy, but the black, I'm the only one.  So when I get in Chicago, there was a same.  So I was the first one who played for the City of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now, Cleveland brought you up.  Did they bring you up to the minors first or did they--?
Speaker 2: They bring me for Negro League. They brought--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they brought from the Negro League and they played with Dayton.  Then did they bring you up to the regular team?
Speaker 2: Right, in '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: And then they traded you to the White Sox?
Speaker 2: No, no, not in '49 [1949].  I stayed in '49 [1949], belong, part of the Cleveland, and '50 [1950], I come in '49 [1949], I was over there, see, well, I hit four hundred and something.  So I came all the way to the open date, and I stay the first month with Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Cleveland had a good team then, right, cause they--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they just win the pennant.
Speaker 1: Won the World Series in '49 [1949].
Speaker 2: They just win the pennant, and World Series and Lou Boudreau used to be a manager.  So we have a, the big team.  So I came to the spring training, and I went to open the season with them.  So, they no have no room for me there because they have the winning team, and the [Dale] Mitchell in left field, Kent Keltner in the third base, Al Rosen was in third base--second--rookie like me but they, they was on top of me.  They had Bobby Ãvila at second base, Johnny Berardino who was, he come out of, a general hospital doctor, you know, Johnny Berardino.  By then he used to be rookie, he used to try to pretend that he want to be in Hollywood.  He dressed, combed, and he said, Johnny, and he make it, you know, Johnny Berardino make a great actor.  He's retired now.  He's an old guy now.  And we had a lot of--Eddie (ph.) Robinson (ph.) played first base, and we have Joe Gordon second base, Larry Doby-second, Kent, I mean [Bob] Kennedy play in, in right field, and Larry Doby and Mitchell in left (unclear), and we had [Jim] Hegan the catcher.  So we had a, a big team.  And we have a (four eighth?) (unclear) Bob Feller, Mike Garcia, Early Wynn and Bob Lemon.  And most, a lot of those guy.  So they have no room for me .  So anyway, I said, well, I practice, and (unclear) had Satchel Paige.  You have a lot of guys.  So they change my position.  They wanted me to play left field.
Story_ID: 56388
Speaker 1: You were a third baseman?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I went to Dayton [Ohio]--I mean I went to Dayton, excuse me, I went to San Diego [California], and again, you know, left field.  I had to put two big year over there, and in '51 [1951], in the '50s [1950s] I not come to the open.  I had my trial game against the [Chicago] Cubs and they drop me, and they said, they dropping me in San Diego.  So I stay there in San Diego, three year, about three, twenty-three--no, three thirty-nine, second for five, one (unclear) of the (unclear).  So he won the title, so and I come to Chicago [Illinois], I mean to Cleveland [Ohio] to the open, see I lead in the league, Chicago want me.  And (unclear) lead pitcher, (Lou Birston?) from Philadelphia didn't want no black, so they make a (unclear) deal.  So I come to Chicago, Brease to, to Cleveland, a relief pitcher, and Gus Samuel and the other player went to Philadelphia.  And this is when I come here, it's May 1st of 1951.  I was the first black player who played for the city.
Speaker 1: For Chicago White Sox?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the first time at bat, I hit a homerun.  That's in New York.  And in the meantime--.
Speaker 1: Now, remember, let's not run over that too fast.  Now, you're--this is your first major league at bat, right?
Speaker 2: No, nah, no, the first time I bat.
Speaker 1: First White Sox at bat.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, the first time I bat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The first time I bat here in Chicago was May 1st, I hit a homerun.
Story_ID: 56389
Speaker 1: In 1951 you hit a homerun your first time at bat?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you went on to become the "Sporting News" rookie of the year.
Speaker 2: Right, in 1951.
Speaker 1: Yeah, talk about that.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) Truly, when I--I'm gonna say this in the beginning, I just come to Chicago [Illinois], I used to stay 6409 Maryland and Cottage Grove, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that area.
Speaker 2: And Mr., Mr. Lewis.  He passed.  So I used to stay there.  So he take me to the ball game.  We went on the streetcar because I don't know my way.  We get up there, so Chico told me later on, Chico Carrasquel.  So I got in, I don't know anybody.  So it's (unclear).  I used to tell Mr. Lewis, okay, when the ballgame is over, you just come up, they let you come up because I don't know my way.  He says, okay, so he said, no, no problem.  So I play third base my first game here.  And come the first out, I hit at third, my first time at bat, the guy who come in the deal with me, I think in Atlanta [Georgia] or something like that, led his team, left handed.  He got a land drive base hit too.  He hit it second.  He had come up and the first pitch, hit it out of the ballpark, over four hundred and thirty nine.  It used to be a bull pen and (unclear) I hit it up there.  So I think we lose the game later on, eight to three, something like that.
Speaker 1: Who did you--who were you playing?
Speaker 2: New York Yankees.
Speaker 1: Yankees, right.
Speaker 2: And Mike Duggle hit a home--no, what you call?  Mickey Mantle, rest in peace, he hit a homerun on the same day in the same game.  So his first homerun, he hit it after me.  He hit a homerun too.  So who could think that he would have hit a five hundred and something, but I no go to, this deep.  I hit it my first one, but I no go on (unclear)--I hit a hundred and eighty something, two hundred, homeruns in my baseball career.
Story_ID: 56390
Speaker 1: So I remember after that, Chico [Carrasquel] told me, hey, Minoso, you know what happened when you first start to come over here?  I said, no.  He said, Paul Ritchie give a meeting, and everybody sit over there.  He stay in the middle.  He say, okay, guy[s], seem like we gonna have black players, and I don't want anybody do anything wrong to him, he's a good ballplayer.  He gonna help us.  So I don't want anybody do anything to make him feel bad.  If you want to speak to him, fine.  If you no want to speak to--it's all right.  But he gonna let you speak to (unclear) when he bat, gonna make you speak to him.  So if anybody no want to play, raise your arm.  He looking around.  He say nobody raised it. Chico, how come?  Nobody raised--he says, you can't because (unclear) because it seem like if anybody no like it, he planning someplace to send him up.  He say I'm (unclear) no hire no many black people there (unclear).  So I come, nobody bother me, not at all, maybe, maybe 'cause he said so because of the--Paul, and never have anything to say to the ball club, said to me.  They were all very nice.  I said, Chico, how come you didn't raise your arm?  He say, you crazy?  If I had raised my hand, my arm, they would send me to Venezuela that way, cause Chico Venezuelan.  So he said, there we come out very good, good friends, Chico, and we still good friends.  He live here in Chicago [Illinois].  So we see each other once in a while.
Speaker 2: Chico Carrasquel?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Carrasquel, very nice, very nice teammate, very nice friend, very nice ballplayer and good, good people.  I love him.
Speaker 2: Can you spell his last name for us?
Speaker 1: Carrasquel, this is C-A-R-A-S-K-U-E-L, [sic, C-A-R-R-A-S-Q-U-E-L] Carrasquel, that's the name.
Story_ID: 56391
Speaker 1: So, your first season, you're rookie of the year.  Now, what did--how did--was it a hard season?  Was it a tough, tough that first season for you?
Speaker 2: No, the toughest season was for the second one.  The first one, seemed like everything I do, everything I do.  If I want to hit it behind the runner, (unclear), Paul Ritchie (ph.) used to look at me, point with his finger, hit behind the runner, he (unclear) first base (unclear).  Man at third, and me to go for double and the man is scored.  They give me a bunt, with two men on base, and I want, going to third because most of the time with two men on base, you're going to third because the first base can't judge too close.  Foul, two strikes, run the play back.  So I just keep the bunt, you know, but I used (unclear) now, like run past the ball, the pitcher.  If you past the pitcher, you safe.  Both the bases loaded, a ball with two strikes.  Oh, those pitchers used to cuss me.  Oh, they say so many thing to me, but I always laugh.  I no say anything.  So really, everything I would do, come like it's God protect me, everything I do.  So I had a good year.  I'm helping the ball club a lot.  Sometime I make a mistake.  I was a green light to steal and seemed like I get in everybody heart.  The people fall in love with me, and I fall in love with the people till now.  And I still in love with the people.  They seem like they love me.  So where else can I go?  And what else can I do?  If (unclear) said, God bless, God bless America like everybody said, and we were here.  And God bless the people here, and God bless the baseball game.  I enjoy very much to be the first guy who would play black, who played for the city [Chicago], and I love it very much to be dealing with the people for so many years and seem like I have some more years, seem like I'm gonna be--where God take me, so they gonna be taking me, talking to the people and be with the people.
Story_ID: 56392
Speaker 1: You were famous for hustling on the field--.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --I mean you would always play hard, and you would always get clutch hits and people, you know, that kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they trust me.
Speaker 1: --it meant, you know, they said you had a lot of heart.  I mean people--how did you--well, talk about that.  I guess, you know--.
Speaker 2: Well, truly to be this kind of way, you have to have the game in your blood, and you have to have the people in your mind and your heart because whatever you do, you don't do for yourself.  You do first for the team that you play there, and for the people.  And not concern myself, and every ballplayer, believe it or not, one way or the other indirectly, we are like a clown to make the people happy.  The people pay to see the boy--the clown do some (unclear) to laugh.  In some place, when I was managing in Mexico, they asked, they told me, hey, Charro, because they used to call me in Mexico the black Charro, that's what they give me a nickname in the Mexico league.  I was playing with the Charros de Jalisco, con charro, black Charro.  Why do you say that we are clowns?  I said, sure, because we have to make these people happy.  These people can holler at you today, one second, and the next second you hero.  And you know, you have to laugh.  If you're a good pro, now, they holler at you and say something you not to supposed to--angry.  You're supposed to ignore it, let it go in this way and this way.  Try to do your duty, the best way you pay them, and your appreciation, all you do right.  I said, clown because you see one time when I was kid, they have one clown do a lot of things.  And they went up there and take the mask away, (unclear) kid, and the clown was crying.  And they asked him, why do you cry?  He said because they have my kid in a funeral, he died, and I have to make money to bury.  (Unclear) So you see, and he was over there laugh to make money to pay the last obligation to the kid who died.  I mean that's the way we are, a clown.  So we try to make a living to bring the bread and butter to our house, to our family, but in the meantime, we make it, these people be happy to come out and see you play.  So all those philosophies--.
Speaker 1: It's entertainment.
Speaker 2: You are clearly right. So when the guy used to hit me with the ball, you think I was--I used to pick up the ball, and people thought I gonna throw it to him, bam, you know, throw it.  And I throw it like, (demonstrates) any way, like this.  (Unclear), Hey, little boy (unclear) there.  I said, ah, you cannot hit me with this garbage.  It hurts.  Sometimes you no be able to beat it because (unclear), but you never let the enemy know your weakness.  It's like boxing.  If you and me boxing, and I get you and one spar--you do this way, and you say, ah, you're dead.  You have to act like nothing happened, and now make you impression.  And you see, (unclear), I hit him with my best punch and nothing happened.
Story_ID: 56393
Speaker 1: Let me, let me ask you this.  This is important, what you just brought up.  I know that players like yourself--now, Frank Robinson was another player that got hit a lot with the baseball.  I think you set the record a couple of years--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I, I used to be--.
Speaker 1: Hit more than any other player.
Speaker 2: More than anybody.  Oh, you know who broke it?
Speaker 1: Who?  Who was that?
Speaker 2: Bailey [sic, Don Baylor].  The first base--I mean the manager for, for the, for the Chicago Cubs--.
Speaker 1: Don Baylor.
Speaker 2: Don Baylor, he broke it.
Speaker 1: He broke your record?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he broke the record.
Speaker 1: He got hit a lot too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he passed me.
Speaker 1: Why do, first of all, why do players get--what do you have to do to set that kind of record?  I mean what kind of behavior are you--are you more aggressive at the plate?  What is it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you no want to, you no want to break a record.  Some people, no, this kind of record.  You don't want it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.
Speaker 2: Before I tell you--.
Speaker 1: But why do you think that you were--you and Frank Robinson and Don Baylor were hit so many times?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you--truly, a lot of people not believe it in the beginning, I used to get hit on purpose a lot.  They used to try to back me up, see, you know, if you scared, ah, they got you all the time, run in.  You, you just scared.  If they find out you scared, they gonna brush you back.  When they are (unclear) brush you back, when you have you off balance because you, you're scared, if you're afraid, you never come out good hitter.  So I used to stay and pick another ball very close, about three or four foot before it goes to the plate.  That's what I decided.  Some people just pick it out since they have a ball in their hand already--no, I no do that.  You can do whatever you want to over here.  So I just take about three or four or five foot, you know, before, this (unclear) smack it.  Okay, sometime I used to make a mistake.  But to see, and so I learned that they just started brushing me on purpose many times.  Oh, I hear the manager, and he say, he did so and so and so.  And had, hit it--and before you have to hit it because your manager told you to knock it down, and you no do it, they fine--he say, fine you or kick you out of the game.  So if somebody hit me on purpose, the manager say, okay, you know what to do.  Hit one of those guys or hit the pitcher because the pitcher before he used to hit.  No, now, but one guy, you know, do it, you had one guy for us because they hit me on purpose, and the manager tell--bring in the relief pitcher, he say, okay, you know what to do.  And the guy hit this guy for two bounces.  So the manager went up there and said, okay, give me, hand me the ball.  This was Paul Richard, he say, you no gonna see this ball for quite a while.   He said, what are you gonna do?  I said, I cannot do that.  He said, ah, you cannot do that, ah.  They can hit Minnie and Minnie go out there against the wall to protect the, the ball hitting you or anybody else.  He no care about his self, and you no gonna protect him?  Fined him two hundred dollars.  And truly in the end, I was enjoying.  You know, why, because a few of those players were pitchers.  I ain't gonna mention their names because that was not a professional if I mention his name.  And remember I told you, I'm pro.  The secret or whatever I make it, I never tell anybody.  So, and those secrets for those people who hit me on purpose and call me a name, I don't going to mention his name.  So they ask me later on, apology.  And one day I was stay over there in the park, I was ready to fight, for one of the pitchers who hit me two times [on] purpose.  And happened, when he come out, I was standing over there, and he touched me, and I said, yes.  He said, Mr. Minoso, can I speak to you?  I said, sure.  I said, I want to apologize.  I want you to forgive me.  I hit you about four times on purpose.  My daughter and my wife, they get on me all the time, and my daughter (unclear) she come asking (unclear), and she ask for your autograph, and you say, okay, cute little thing, if you go over there and get the baseball and sign it, brand new ball, and give it to her.  And my daughter come home, and he say, now, wait a minute.  So, daddy, you ever hit him?  He said, yes.  So I want you to forgive me.  I said, okay, shake his hand; couple of guy that I never thought that they go to, but they do.
Story_ID: 56394
Speaker 1: So do you think these guys were hitting you because--they were throwing the ball at you because you're a black player?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if it is because, I couldn't say, but there was, I mean there was a few.  And I used to hit it closer to the plate, and I was so good with the bat in the hand those particular years, three hundred, eight years, and, and I would hit in the clutch a lot.  Someone, no, but someone's yes because they holler at me.  You had one manager--he passed.  He used to be manager of Philadelphia (Phillies?).  He used to holler, a big name, everything, and used to have one pitcher over there, he was tough.  And he wanted (unclear) Count Michael out of the game.  He hit it here [pointing to ear], and Michael used to bleed in (unclear) ear--.
Speaker 1: Who is this?
Speaker 2: Count Michael.  He used to be at second base for the, for the White Sox.  And he hit him in head, he tried to come back the following year, he never could make it.  So, and this guy, this pitcher used to be--there was a pitcher, okay, the pitcher called, oh, he was tough.  And truly, I hear all the things, but I never [was] scared.  I remember one year, my first one, we played in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I got hit right here [pointing to lower back].  And I went down, stayed there on the ground.  I can no even breath, and Paul Ritchie come out, the trainer, and he said, hey, Minoso, Minnie, you just come back, and let the trainer work on you, pick your clothes and, and go to New York.  We no be there till day after tomorrow.  Relax.  You have people that are there, families you know.  I said, Paul, you're the manager.  But I ain't gonna get up.  If I get up, maybe some (unclear) day easy I gonna get killed because everybody think that I'm scared.  And the first pitcher they gonna try to intimidate and one of those pitches gonna kill me.  I gonna stay.  Get out, and say, well, you all black and blue.  I said, well, black and blue is not gonna stop me.  Anyway, and I get on first base and the second time I called time.  I called--time to come out.  He said, what happened?  I said, nothing.  I just pretend, and no time, I gonna be at second base.  Minnie, you crazy.  I said, oh, yes.  And I stay there, you know.  He said, pitcher, slide in second base, (unclear) short stop, the ball went through center field.  He (unclear) and I stayed at second base because the shortstop owe something to me.  When I was play third base here, he said--I wait for him, and he slide here, in my chest, caught me a little bit here and cut the uniform, and I wait for him, he tagged from second to third, and I wait for him.  If it was a closer play, no.  So I have in my mind, I say, I give you some time, I got (unclear), didn't say anything.  The only thing he said was, "they'd better stop those things because somebody gonna killed, ghee wiz", you know.  I said, you--now, you gonna try to stop it, but I never fight with anybody.  I've never gone over there and throw a bat at anybody.  I never look at anybody, cussing because they knocking me down.  And this is what I said, today, I think the pitcher, they're not protected too good.  And so the pitcher probably scared to pitch it inside.  If he a rookie or not, and new, he scared to pitch it inside because if they not gonna call.  That's what I wrote on the (unclear).  I no criticize.  That's what I wrote, I'm against it now, in baseball.  The pitcher can now pitch in, move in--if he find (unclear) they have to go--if he find it out they do on purpose, okay, fine him or kick him out.  But for the pitcher, pitch it inside, and when he (unclear) want to hit somebody in the head, it's tough to hit 'em in the head.  So because if he hit, plan to hit you over here, you just move there.  He cannot hit you.  He never gonna hit you.  And if they plan to hit you and really want to hit you, they take a measure from the head here.
Speaker 1: The middle part of your body.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you, you, you cannot get it ready.  You're gonna get it.  But, that's--so now, if you haven't it hit now, from the middle of the plate, out, that's for the pitcher.  And for the middle play inside (unclear), just like you know it's coming.  Do you follow me?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Because you no gonna swing inside.  They not gonna call.  You going swing for the middle plate out.  So you stay over there, and you, you no gonna swing.  You're gonna do this way.  You no gonna swing it.  If he hit too close, you look, and umpire might (unclear) say--so the pitcher was intimidated, if he a rookie, you intimidate him.  So here they are.  So we kill those guys.  I don't know if you know that or not.
Story_ID: 56395
Speaker 1: I know it's a difference.  I mean I knew there was something--I know, in those--in the days when you played, I don't think they--you didn't have as many, you didn't have a lot of protection as a batter, right?
Speaker 2: No, none at all because if you--(unclear) (simultaneously)
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Helmet, didn't have a elbow pad or nothing like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, no, no.  If he,--later on they come out with (unclear) (helmet?), but if he, if you hitting one out of the ballpark, and one pitcher before, and you stand over there do (unclear) the slow ball or just (unclear) over there jumping and (unclear), uh, uh.  Don't stay there till the time the ball hit up there in the bleacher, the nexy time you got it.  They say, at least respect to me; do like a pro; you're gonna get it, but you no stand up there.  Next time, on the next hit, he got it.  The next hit, they knock--they (unclear), they (unclear) you back because it happened to me a couple of times.  I hit it behind a rookie Callarooto (ph.).  He hit one out, and the first pitch I was down, but they know I no scared.  So those people they no fool around much with the people they know, they know, they no care, they no afraid.  And I'm never afraid.
Speaker 1: Do you think that that's why there're more homers hit now--?
Speaker 2: I guess so.
Speaker 1: --cause they can't--.
Speaker 2: A whole lot because you see, just right there.  If, before you used to see one brush, one there, one outside, brush again, or move, and you don't know.  But see now like from the--for (unclear) to call inside, so you say what, from the middle of the plate.  You have to have a ground bullet to throw by--to hit it all the time, cause they look only one pitch.  They no gonna swing inside.  They gonna swing from the middle because it--they no gonna pitch inside.  The rookie might say, well, if I hit, they're gonna fight with me, or maybe a hitter gonna come out and fight with me.  So they get up there.  Now, if you have a hundred ninety-five, ninety-six miles an hour, ah, that's different.  But those guys who brought you back, ain't nobody say anything, I, I (unclear) the guy.  They have a lot of guts.  That was Johnson from, out there (unclear) the big left-handed pro.
Speaker 1: Randy Johnson, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I saw one time, they throw at one guy--they don't throw.  The guy, some time the back of the ball, they went this way.  And if he go this way, and the ball is there, how can you go look at the pitcher.  You are back of the ball, and you follow me?  And then he do this way, and do this way, you are back of the ball, and the ball (unclear) in, how are you gonna look at the pitcher.  And he'd look at Johnson, and Johnson say, I not throw, but you gonna get it.  And the (unclear) (forward?) pitcher hit him, up there.  You're thinking the guy went to--no, no, he went to first base and the other guy who not try to hit anybody, but he no--he pitch the inning out, that's clever, a lot of guts.  In, out, in.  So the other guy, the guy used to be pitching from here to the Cubs, and he went now to Atlanta, Meadow, Meadow, Meadland (ph.)?
Speaker 1: I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Number thirty-one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with the glasses--.
Speaker 2: No, he no wear glasses.  He used to be--maybe he wear glasses now, but he used to be one of the great pitchers here for the Chicago Cubs, Merla, Merlock?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Meadows?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Meadows.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Meadows.  Thank you, sir, right.  Yeah, he go there and there.  He do the business.  He no try to hit anybody, but he get inside, up, okay.  Those guys, I'm hundred percent with them.  I'm against it, and I not hide it to say, this kind of rule because now, seem like the guy who know how to--they don't--they cannot defend it.  They just there, there, and the people wonder, how can he come right in the middle of the play with two strikes when he cannot come close inside because they afraid--not afraid, but they just--they don't want to lose the job.  And he no wanna get fired, and he no wanna go nowhere else, but someday somebody gonna get killed.  The league supposed to stop those hitters from going up there and fight with the pitcher.  Somebody gonna get hurt, one.  And, I saw something too the other day that I said, now, what is going on.  The guy get a line drive, I think for bunting up (unclear) in eyes.  How come the league no get a rule to every pitcher to, to get a line driver for every hitter you supposed to (unclear) (sooth?) the hitter.  Ah, the pitcher cannot pitch inside, ah, the hitter can hit it.  Maybe the guy lose the eyes.  He already did.
Story_ID: 62140
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I was asking you about if you ever were permanently injured or scarred by any of those pitches that were thrown at you?
Speaker 2: Yes, sure.  You see, I had this one here that I (unclear) first.  I have a broken--I played third base in '48 [1948] in Cuba.  The score was 0-0, in the ninth inning.  Monte Urban (ph.) was hitting, Morrie Urban, Morrie Urban, (unclear) they gave me five stitch, no teeth broke or nothing.  And after that I have here, over here.  In 1960, Larry from Detroit [Michigan], good man, so that day and we, we fight for the pennant.  And I was up there, and I tagged the ball breaking, like a knuckle ball hit me over here.  And I pick up the ball and throw it to him.  He say, hey Minoso, leave the ball alone.  The people are gonna believe I ain't gonna have nothing, my fast ball.  And I laughed, and I bleeding, went to first base.  I played till the fifth inning, sixth, bleeding like the devil.  So the manager, (unclear) told me no, they say, we behind six to two or something, Minnie, okay, told the doctor, taking him to the doctor.  We went, they gave me six stitches inside.  They gave me four outside.  And one time here too, I got hurt here with--(unclear) Howard, the catcher, from--.
Speaker 1: Elston Howard.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Elston Howard (unclear) (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the first game of a double header, and I have a man at second base.  I was at bat, and I pop up.  And he can't see the ball, but I stay over there like it was hit out of the ballpark, to see, what can fool him.  And they holler from the dug out, and (unclear) holler to the Yankees.  And he find it.  He took it, take a masquerade throw, hit me over here, knock me down.  Okay, so, he come by me, and I'm sorry, I say, no, it's--I know it's not on purpose.  So, okay, they take me up there.  The doctor come out.  They give me four stitches outside, three inside.  And (unclear) lighten up, I went down there, second game I told, no, I'll, I play.  (Unclear) (Lupper) was the manager.  I said, no, I'll play.  So (unclear) lightened up, and so he take Stephens (ph.), who was a left hand hitter, off, and get me in.  First time, second time, I hit a homerun.  Finally, we won the game three to one or something the second game.  So, but I played.  And I was hurt, and I was there too (unclear) take me blood, from waist because I stretched my muscle, and we (unclear) in Detroit [Michigan], and the doctor said, take about two, big bottle like that and black blood.  He said, don't you play, no.  All my waist here, just, sore.  Told (Foley?) what did doctor say?  Say, I can play.  And they banded me over here, over here, here, here, here.  I tell you, that's a dangerous way I ever played.  Every time I moved I saw stars, and we come back in Kansas City [Missouri].  And we scored a lot of runs, we win.  The second day, Kansas City come up, and scored twenty or sixteen runs.  And I can't even walk like that.  (Unclear) the same guy this way, and left handed, down the left field line, (unclear) go, and you know, I played nine innings.  They beat us by sixteen or seventeen to three or four.  And they no remove me, I play.  So and that's the reason--and I believe, because I think you asked me before, that you hear, your daddy say I was a hustler (unclear).  I'm sorry.  It's true.  I never make it up myself, but I gonna stay there, and I mean it.  In baseball, nobody that ever lived or dead hustled more than I do.  When they talk, I hear talk about hustle, they might not mention me, but I say, he hustle like me because when I played, flesh and toes, finger, operation here.  Any time the ball hit over here, got (unclear) bleedings, no guy play like that.  And I did.  I have a fracture here, in my head, the doctors, they don't know.  They take x-ray in New York, and they show negative.  And I played.  And whatever, I got dizzy a little bit, they take me.  I got a fracture.  I have to stay almost two weeks in the hospital here in Chicago; played broken, fractured toes.  Tell me what ball player do that.  I don't care who you name, anybody.
Speaker 1: They don't do it much today at all.
Speaker 2: Not today, even before.  They have a lot of guy hustling before, you know, hustle.  You no want to give your position to nobody, (unclear) play, but to play for with broken finger or have fracture and bleeding teeth, and just get over there again, no.  I did.  And (unclear), you can ask if (unclear).  And the club is playing, they're gonna say.  So to me, I'm the number one.  See, so, I'm the number one, I'm the number one, six decades I play, I'm the number one hustler in baseball.  See, but anybody else, I don't care.
Story_ID: 62141
Speaker 1: Now, you were an all-star for what, ten years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a all-star about eight times [sic, nine times].
Speaker 1: Eight times, okay, all right, and so you--.
Speaker 2: Eight or seven times, I think--.
Speaker 1: Eight or seven times, and you played with the [Chicago] White Sox from 1951 to--?
Speaker 2: First 1951 to 1957, and after that I went to Cleveland [Ohio] two years and come back to the White Sox.
Speaker 1: So they brought you back to the White Sox, and you, I guess it's common knowledge that you're one of the most popular players to ever play for the White Sox.
Speaker 2: Well, that's what they said, and I really appreciate it.  I no said it myself.  I let the people said it.  I no think if you had said that, that it sound good, to myself.  I don't think--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: --I no think I'm supposed to--.
Speaker 1: It's, it's true.  I know it's true, and I've heard it so many times.
Speaker 2: And I think with, you know, I've been told this.  It's okay.  I enjoy it there, and I'm happy to be doing those things for one organization.  And everywhere I go, the people remember me with respect and love, and they have it for me and my family back to them.  So this is something beautiful, because sometimes, some players, they retire and they're not even--people don't recognize, and they no care.  And it seem to me like, everywhere I go, even in Hawaii, you see they blowing horns, hey, Minnie, police, everybody, and the mayor of the city, everybody.  I know everybody.  But I conducts myself like a good human, and respect every human, no matter who they are.  And they pay me back with respect.   So I think I'm happy, and I think my family's happy to see the way I am.  And I'm very happy because (unclear), you know.  I have a very nice wife, very nice.  I love her, my kid, my son, lovely kid, everybody love him.  And the rest of my kids, you know, they love it, and I love them.  So I'm pretty happy man, with pretty happy family.  And that's good instinct to leave, while you have a good family and while you have a good wife to protect you, take care of everything because I cannot do everything myself.  And she the one to do the number or do this.  And I enjoy it, enjoy (unclear) very much, and I'm very happy, and I hope it be this way the long I live.

Speaker 1: Tell, tell me, were you--did you know Fidel Castro when he was trying to pitch for the New York Yankees.  I know he tried--?
Speaker 2: No, no, I never--I don't think he--I never know that.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, he tried.  He had a try-out with the Yankees in the 1940s.
Speaker 2: I don't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a pitcher.  Yeah, I thought I'd ask you about that.  And can you--who do you think were the best players by position in baseball history?  I'm gonna put you on the spot.
Speaker 2: Who, what?
Speaker 1: The best baseball players?
Speaker 2: I know, the best ball player all the way around--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: To me the best hitter, I ever see in baseball is Mr.--number nine, Ted Williams, the best hitter I ever seen.  And the best ballplayer all the way around, that's number twenty-four, Mr. Mickey Mantle, no--Willie Mays.
Speaker 1: Willie Mays, okay.
Speaker 2: Willie Mays, that was the best ball player, all the way around.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and they have a whole lot of good players, but the--I just--this is the two in my book, the two.  So might, somebody don't agree with me, I respect that.  But to me, if you told me (unclear) I'd say there.
Story_ID: 62143
Speaker 1: There, there are many, today especially, there are many Latin American players playing baseball in the United States.  There's so many that a couple of years ago, the all-star team looked like the Latin American all-stars so that most of the stars, when you go down the line, you got [Nomar] Garciaparra of Boston and, you got El Duque [Orlando Hernandez], and you got the pitcher from New York--what's his name?  The one that's the best in the (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the best closer, yeah, from, he was from Panama, no from Dominican Republic.
Speaker 1: There's so many, and you have [Sammy] Sosa here in Chicago [Illinois].  He's the best player in the city.  You know, how does that make you feel, all these great Latin American players.
Speaker 2: Truly, I'm human.  I'm just not Latin.  I like to see it, but I'm not this kind of guy what look, not because of Latin.  I just look like a good ballplayer, not because they're Latin.  I'm like international.  I'm the guy to not look at just race.  I looking for the quality.  So when you have to pick it out and say, Mr. Martinez, whatever it is, okay, from Dominican Republic, and from the other, [Sandy] Alomar, he's from Puerto Rico, okay.  But beside them, when you talk about quality, by the players, I no looking for nationality.  I looking for quality, you know.  I say, well, he a good ballplayer.  So make me think and be happy because they have a, how do you call it, (unclear), like a get-together, the game, they're open for everybody.  And whoever have the quality, they give the opportunity.  They stop it, too many, many coming--they used to have it before.  Now, they discriminating me.  They (unclear) because they no give me a chance.  Everybody have a chance.  But if it's your chance, no qualify, that's it.  So how many baseball players in the minor leagues that born and raised here in the United States America, they hit at .220, .300, .280, .300 in the minor league, and they no make it here.  And how many in imported players that here, they hit--play different positions, they hit at .240, .250, .260, .240, .260.  Many, and they not American, they imported.  So that's not discrimination.  So I think that baseball is open, wide opened for everybody.  If you conduct yourself the way you're supposed to do, you have a chance.  And that's good because you have a lot of youngsters who dream to be a ballplayer and those youngsters stay away from a lot of bad things.  Stay away from alcohol, maybe stay away from gangs; maybe stay away from troublemakers.  And he keep it, do the hundred percent in school because in those baseball teams now, if you just (unclear) out of school, they, they overlook you.  And that's why I just said to those youngsters.  Stay in school, no mess around in school because when you mess around, your chance becomes shot, shot, shot, shot to the head.

Speaker 1: Tell me something about the 1959 White Sox and I think that was one of the best White Sox teams?
Speaker 2: When--yeah, because they beat us.  I was in Cleveland [Ohio] back in '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: They sent you to Cleveland when they had the Go-Go White Sox--.
Speaker 2: Nah, no, that was--look what happened.  I was supposed to come to Chicago in '59 [1959] because I went there for two years.  Finally, there was a general manager with Chicago, and he finish here.  They went to Cleveland, and he tried--he get me and Rocky Colavito back to Cleveland because they said--he said that we are good with the kid and the kid follow us a lot, and we always talk to those kids and sign autographs, and he wanted people to come.  He said, son--he used to call me son.  He used to call me (unclear) number two.  I said, he said, well, two years.  And that's the last year here, and he said, I'm sending you back to Chicago.  So they have a deal, he and Brubaker and so I'm gonna come.  But I was a leader in the team by this time, the (unclear).  I was a leader in the team and hung on RBI, stolen base and more (unclear).  So and we one game behind the White Sox.  So Brubaker called, and he said, Vic, I'm sorry, we cannot do the deal.  If you're back to Cleveland without Minnie.  They kill me in Cleveland, so wait after the season's over and we do the deal.  He say, okay.  So happen Chicago beat us in Cleveland.  We fight, they cinch it with us.  We finish second, and after that, twenty days later, the trade come up, I come to Chicago.  There's stories, a lot of people have it confused.  Minnie, you was the left field in '59 [1959] when the ball, you know, the guy throw a beer or whatever.  No, it was not me.  That was Al Smith.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a famous incident where a fan threw a beer on a guy's head.
Speaker 2: That's Al Smith.
Speaker 1: It's Al Smith.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they say like (unclear), Al Smith.  He, he passed about a couple of month ago.  He was the one.  A lot of people used to say, no, this is you.  I said, no, I was in Cleveland.  I said, that's Al Smith.  Al Smith.

Speaker 2: In '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you were an all-star that year too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so yeah, but I think in '60 [1960], they have three MM in the all-star team.  I think me--Roger Marris, in right, and I think Mickey Mantle said that I was in the left.
Speaker 1: Three MM's?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, there was--now, with Tony (unclear), my first hit that I was Sox again, there was a homerun, but with the bases loaded.
Speaker 1: So you came back, your first at bat--?
Speaker 2: Not my first at bat.  This was my second official.
Speaker 1: Your second official at bat, you hit a--?
Speaker 2: A home run with the bases loaded.
Speaker 1: A grand slammer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A grand slam, homerun.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and after then in (unclear), in the bottom of the ninth, I hit a--and I'm a lead-off man, and I hit a homerun too to win the game.  I had two hits, and it was two homeruns.  So this was something to--seemed to me like it was yesterday.  Yeah, it happened.
Speaker 1: Those kind of plays will make you a hero, and--.
Speaker 2: Well, so, to the fan--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.

Story_ID: 62146
Speaker 1: They expect the best of the pro, the pro guy, and I give it my best.  And so this is the reason that I have all this love inside to those people heart and brain, that I used to go over there and give everything for them.  Run against the wall for them, and after that I went to St. Louis and I just had a light concussion, run against the wall in '62 [1962], game against the [Brooklyn] Dodgers.  And I bleed (unclear) ear, and I stayed four days unconscious.  They thought [I was] gonna die.  Just to run against the wall to get the ball.
Speaker 2: So you were in a coma for four days?
Speaker 1: Four days, yeah.  They thought I was--they look (unclear) the head, they say, we have a concussion, have something (unclear) have a concussion before in '55 [1955].  He have that in New York.  So I broke a rib, wrist, I broke that.
Speaker 2: I remember there was a picture of you in "JET Magazine" in the hospital.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this--a lot of things, and I come back again.  So that's me.  Nobody, and I'm not ashamed to say, I said, I might say, no, I say, I (unclear) lousy hitting, I'm a lousy baseball player, don't matter, but hustle more than me, no, I'm the number one.  I don't care who it is.
Story_ID: 62147
Speaker 1: When you couple that with the fact that you were a good hitter, a great baseball player, that's (laughter), that makes it a lot better.  Can you tell me, now, what was your last year playing with the [Chicago] White Sox?  I mean were you--you played in six decades.  Can you tell people how you were able to do that?  I mean what--I know Bill Veck had something to do with that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, you see, Bill Veck is a--at one time I have a little bit, I have a little bit, (unclear) what is it?  Bill Veeck, Branch Rickey, he a history man, bring--integrate the league.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Branch Rickey.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But how was Bill Veeck?
Speaker 2: Bill Veeck, he a history man too because Bill Veeck, he bring Doby, so to me--.
Speaker 1: That's Larry Doby.
Speaker 2: Yeah, to me the first guy, this is the one have all the credit because this is the first guy.  A lot of people say, well, there was a lot of this in American League, (unclear) National and American league is the same, only different name.  It's in the United States.  Okay, Bill Veck was honored in Cleveland [Ohio].  And after that he named him manager here for Early Wynn, not for Ellie Wynn, for Bob Lemon.  So one month or so into the season, and I--and, you know, and a lot of people said, "how come you're not", you know, you played for team.  I, no, (unclear) he's the first one managing, the first manager, for, black for the, for the White Sox.  They said, they, they have a, you know, a history.
Speaker 1: Bob Uman (ph.), yeah.
Speaker 2: No, no, Larry.
Speaker 1: Larry Doby, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Bill Veeck had tried to bring history in his way, himself.  So, and me, he keep, however, I never dream about it, telling me I (unclear) there, there to be more decorated man.  And his son, who is, this is the ring.  I played my sixth decade up there, and St. Paul Saints, over there in Minnesota.  This is the team he have over there, so I play--.

Speaker 2: Like that.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Left is good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, like that.  That's fine, just to keep it still there for a second.  There it is.

That's a 100--that's, that's 230 games a year.  So I been playing more games than any ballplayer ever lived.  So I play more games than anybody for all those years.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 2: Yeah, in '76 [1976]--.
Speaker 1: --he first brought you back in '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got a base hit in, against the Dodgers--no, against Los Angeles.

Speaker 2: Nah, I was out.  I was the out guy.  I got a ground ball to, to (third base?).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--.
Speaker 2: And when I went to the '93 [1993]--.
Speaker 1: But you made contact with it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was in '93 [1993], they, they, you know, they no want it.  A few ballplayers say, no.  There was a Black Jack McDowell, McDowell.
Speaker 1: McDowell, right.
Speaker 2: Well, and he was, by this time, he was the baseball player representative, I guess, for the team.  He said, no, and the other big mouth to open, likeI think it was Ozzie Guillen probably, said--they asked him in the radio, and he said, no, I don't think it's right to have him play.  And I put it this way, Ozzie, if he would be Luis Aparicio to want to play to make a decade, you would say no?  Okay.  And the other one was, Grand--Rand, LeRand, LeRand, the guy used to play left field, he's old man now (unclear) LeRand (ph.).  He went, he back to New York after that.
Speaker 1: I can't remember the--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he got sick, and LeRand (ph.), LeRand.  So he said, no, I don't think--I said, forget it.  But the organization, they were fine.  They want it, you know, he didn't--[Ron] Schueler was [general] manager, and a good man, Jerry, great.  The president of the Sox.
Speaker 1: Reinsdorf, yeah.
Speaker 2: Jerry, yes.
Speaker 1: Jerry Reinsdorf.
Speaker 2: Just great.  And Eddie too, the whole organization was great.
Speaker 1: That's Eddie Einhorn.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the whole organization, great, but Jerry is a good man.  So everybody like him, I like him, think he's great.  I was lucky to be working in the (unclear) (owners?) that so many great guys.  And I think--well, Bill Veeck, his work is great.  It's great, no question about it.  And Desmond (ph.), great too.  The best manager I ever played [for], Paul Richards.  So, and the owners, those too, that's great.  When you talk about great, great, my respect to them.
Story_ID: 56406
Speaker 1: We, we're talking about Cuba--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, yeah, so go ahead, we're rolling now, what the political situation in Cuba, how it's affected you at all, and how you were saying that you can go back anytime you want.  You've (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.  I can go back any time I wanted before.  It never stopped me.  This, something (unclear) because I'm professional player, I'm a professional in baseball, in sport.  So I never included my nose in politics.  I never said anything, whatever I feel, I feel inside.  So I respect anybody idea, and I have my own idea.  So I would be busy, and kind of tough to get out and go and spend week to two weeks with a lot of obligations I have.  So I talk to my sister once, and mostly every couple of weeks, I call.  If she needed something, I'll help her the best I can.  But I haven't been going.  So I have two kid who was born up there, come while I was a kid, (unclear) six--four years old.  They grown now, and I have two was born here, one in Washington and one here in Chicago [Illinois].  So, you know, to explain to go there, it's kind of tough, but I think everything, either way, (unclear) God make a decision.  So I watch, I have a interview some time, from here to my house, to Miami [Florida], Miami to Cuba.  And they interviewed and directed, and I talk to the people, giving my blessing to the people.  I'm not a politician.  I just say, hey brothers, I wish you the best.
Speaker 1: Now, you are well known in Cuba?  Are you well known in Cuba?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a lot of people who probably--they say now, that I have a newspaper--they just saying it was my picture in Cuba about I don't know, seven, eight months and come, article about myself over there.  And I never see anybody else, players with big reputations here, from Cuba, I no see the picture come out.  So my, so the guy sent it to me, and the guy went up there.  My sister sent it to me, one article last month about one year, talk about myself and my reputation in baseball, and everything, is because I have my nose clean.  And the way I never talk about anybody, nobody--somebody probably put the finger in my throat to see if I spill something.  I say, I don't have anything to say.  So I respect everyone and I wish you the best to everyone.  So nobody know nothing, and I don't have to say anything or offend anybody.  So when somebody want to know, I have to say it.  I haven't said anything.  I just said to myself, whatever I want to say, to myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I remember you asking me, I say, no, no.  The, the problem at home be to mom and dad, that's your problem.  The kid, no stick your nose in mom and dad problems.  That (unclear).  This is two countries.  I'm here, and this I'm happy that I was become citizen, I'm here.  So I belong to here.  And I live here.  So--.
Speaker 1: Do people ever put pressure on you to take a side or?
Speaker 2: No.  Not at all.  I just take--I just never, ever.  This what make this country be the way they are, one of the best countries in the world.  They no push you to be there, no, no.  You there, and here I'm free.
Story_ID: 56407
Speaker 1: Do, do the Cuban ballplayers here in the [United] States, do they stick together?  Do you have a--?
Speaker 2: Well, they--after you finish a game, now, that's a different thing.  You know, those guys, he have a group, and I have mine.  You know, because they--it's like, like a different role. They play, they having at times, they associate in a different way.  And I have mine in different way to be perhaps together all the time, well, they might have a different time or different place or we have a different business to do, and my business is not their business.  My business what I do this way, just like two leagues, two leagues.  I'm in my league and they in their league, but they're my friend, and anytime, if we with each other, hi, how are you doing?  Not that we just get the time to spend the time together (unclear), no, no, no.  You, you have--.
Speaker 1: So you don't really have a, like a--?
Speaker 2: A relationship where you say, hi, how you doing?  And hi, how you doing?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Okay, we happen to see each other every year over there, Fort, Fort Lauderdale, that we play this kind of game, the Joe DiMaggio game for benefit for the kid, the hospital, Joe DiMaggio [Children's] Hospital.  So we play this for many years, and I remember about a year before or a year and half before he passed, he said, Minnie, I'd like you to keep a do it, to the end, all the time, never refuse it (unclear).  I said, no, Joe, I'll be there in those games till the time that God let me.  I'll be there.  So, we shake hand.  So we, we were pretty good friends.  And he said to me, one day we eat a hot dog over there in the beach, and he said, anything I be able to do, I can do for you, let me know, Minnie.  I said, okay, Clip [Yankee Clippers] number five, thank you.  So he was a good man.  Rest in peace, have to be rest in good peace because he good man.  A lot of people didn't understand, but happened we understand each other very well, and that's what he said. I'm a lucky man.  So every time I meet someone, a friendship stay there.  And very surely, I have a friend that I just meet, and if we friend couple years and after that quit, no.  Seem like every time I make a friend, it's forever.
Story_ID: 56408
Speaker 1: Seems like you've got a positive impact on a lot of people.  And I know a lot of the, you're a fan favorite--how would you like to be remembered, I mean as you, as you look back over your career?
Speaker 2: I love it.  I be remembered for the people, sure.  That's great.  That's what give you, that's what give you inspiration to live.  That's what give you strongest way to do something, to take care of yourself and to take care of somebody if you can, because it seems to you, inside of you, it seem like people like you, people want you.  And some time you do thing to either, hurt yourself, but you not let they know.  You sacrifice yourself to make them be happy.  And this happened to me.  So some time maybe I get home late because I have to give maybe ten minutes to friend (unclear) or maybe he give me a ride, okay.  So I take maybe ten minutes or fifteen minutes away from my obligation so when I come home, "where you been?" I said, well, I was talking to, or I give a ride to--see, I don't give a, maybe a ride to anyone, you know, but in case because that thing happened to me before.  Now, I've been the most dedicated, a hundred percent to my house, my kids in school and to the ballpark, to the slugger, over there in, on Clark and go to the ballpark, come here, go to the boat, so we have boat over there in Diversey, and do something here in the house.  I mean this, before we used to cook a lot, but now, I no cook much (laughter) because they in, on a diet, you know.  So I cook a lot of food, a lot of vitamins, whatever that.  So I don't want to keep a do it because I don't want to wife or my kid gain weight, a few pounds, they put--blame me.  So they, they in the line, so I say, okay.  Now, I no cook much here.  But, but I enjoy it.  And to be liked for the people, this is something that you cannot buy with money.  This is something to you might buy for the way you are, the way your personality, the way it attracts, and you handle yourself to have a friend.  And I think I've gone everyway, anyplace, no matter what time, (unclear), I'm not afraid.  Nobody ever do anything wrong to me.  Say, Minnie, just today, saw a group over there.  I said, well, there's group over there, they say hello to me.  I said, how you doing?  If he, I be able to help anybody, they ask me, little help, and they say can you--fifty cents, one dollar, I give it.  I don't care who they are.  I just give it, and sometimes I look this way, I say no, if it is two, no.  I give one and one for my son.  If I give one dollar, one dollar for--the other dollar is for my son, you know.  So this is the way I split some time.  They look and they see my license plate, hey, Minnie, how are you?  So, those guys, they just say, Minnie, don't worry.  We take care of, we wash your car.  So that's me.  I, I no have anything to worry with anybody, no matter if the people like you say, and gangs, they all respect me.  They protect me, and I respected them.  If they ask me questions, (unclear) I go over there and make a lot of speech in different places even at (your?) house.  And so many people was out and come out cause Minnie thank you.  I say, look, get a good way.  So later on this kid got married, got a family, got a good job.  So I was talking to him and this young, youngster over there, talk to the kid, I mean making me feel happy.
Story_ID: 56409
Speaker 1: I know your mother [Cecilia Arrieta] died when you were younger.
Speaker 2: Yeah, about twelve, eleven years old.
Speaker 1: But did your father [Carlos Arrieta]--well, he got a chance to see you play, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure, my daddy died in '60-something [1960-something], you know, on my way back here.  And, yeah, my daddy died, he saw me play.
Speaker 1: Was he pretty cool with your--?
Speaker 2: Ah, yeah, my daddy and myself, we like two friends.  I no call him, never called my father, padre.  I used to call, uncle, and because we raised a few nephews.  And I, hear--I kid, I hear said, tio, tio.  And in Spanish, uncle is tio, tio, tio.  And so that's what I would learn to call my father, tio, tio.  So, we were pretty good buddies, very good friend, good friend.  So I no consider him like my daddy.  I consider him like my good friend.  So, he passed, I was over here, and (unclear) in 1967 or eight [1968], '71 [1971] he died.  So, I just think, think that he's there (unclear) I think, seem like I think to a lot of things in life that I still have to do.  And that's what's keeping my energy, my spirits and my energy.
Story_ID: 56410
Speaker 1: So I put it together, and sometimes when I needed something, I sit over there and my wife (unclear) and ask, say, I don't know what you think there.  Sometimes she come out and say look, no this is the way I think, there, there, there.  She very good, good direction to me.  And a couple of times I just told, honey, if ever me to you (unclear), probably be owning half of Chicago (laughter).  And so, because I want to do a lot of things to--and she a good brain.  She a good business.  She like the business.  She like to--try it there and there, you know, she, she showed me a lot.  And I appreciate it, and I was very happy.  So, but there was impossible business.  By this time, you know, she's, you know, I'm a little bit older (unclear).  So then she asked me to marry, and I marry after that.  But the longer I with her, we about fifteen, sixteen years.  I'm a very happy, happy man.  So this is what keeping me going.  So I make mistakes, like sometime, and I'll say, look, you, you do right or you do wrong, or you do something--you try to do right, and, and you do wrong, it don't mean you try to.  It's like human, we all make mistakes.  You know, if you try, because some time you try to do something and you feel you do right, and they do wrong.  The other person maybe think it is wrong, and you just (unclear), you give, you say, look, I do (unclear) this concerned, not to hurt you, to make--to help you.  But, no, but this is wrong, so what can you do?
Story_ID: 56411
Speaker 1: Do you have, at the beginning, I asked you if you had a favorite saying or a favorite phrase, do you have like something that you'd like young people coming along to know before we close out.
Speaker 2: Well, now, truly, I want to say something special to the youngsters.  And I'm glad, and I want thank you to you and to your partner to give me the opportunity to express myself the way I wanted because sometime they--some people, they no want you to express yourself the way you want it.  They just put the rule there, and they interfere and you no say what you want to say.  It's what they want.  Sure, first, I want to say to the youngsters, please, the school, this is the most important thing in life.  In my time, maybe the, we no need so much in school to give much to what we want to be.  Now, this possible--this impossible to any youngster that no finish school, without his degree, even to find a job, to even to wash dishes in any restaurant, to clean the floor.  So now we have the opportunity, and maybe we didn't have it many years ago.  Now, they have it, the opportunity, and you know that it--have this opportunity to give it, because if those youngsters, if they think, they're the one that gonna run this world.  I don't mean a world (unclear), the world and everywhere you go, the youngsters, they the one, the future, like here, the future American, they gonna direct the way the other kid when they grow up.  So you can be anything you want as a person, a lawyer, whatever you want to be, doctor.  But you have to be prepared.  No let anybody confuse you, youngsters, take this word from me, from Minnie Minoso, your friend, no let anybody confuse you to do whatever they want you to do.  If you not too sure, tell, if you in a school, you tell the teacher if it happen in school.  If you was off the school, tell your mother or your father.  Don't be ashamed to talk to your father, talk to your mother, protect your mother.  She is the best friend you can have.  She the one to give you her life to protect this (unclear), because sometimes you have someone to come up and try to make you change your mind and give you an idea.  It's no good.  So those people, they criminal for they no have any consideration for their own self because anybody who try to interfere, the brain of those kids, they criminal.  So finish school.  Get along with anybody in the school.  Be friend, no look, race, color, position or nationality.  They'll only be human.  I think this is the best way those youngsters.  No matter what kind of friend, if you--what kind of color, race or (unclear) of the friend, don't make any difference.  You look for the heart and the brain.  And that's what I want those kid do.
Story_ID: 56412
Speaker 1: I wanted they not to keep a secret, working together, protect each other.  You protect each other in the neighborhood, you protect the other kid.  No fight, just protect each other.  When you in the school, protect each other in the school.  No try to give a chance to anybody to do something wrong in the school.  When you see someone to do something funny in school, call the principal right away and tell it.  If you get together, no matter how big or small you are, they cannot beat you because you're together.  You work together and nobody can beat you.  And that's what I told those kids.  You see in the school, I put it this way, I told this kid, put you both hand like there.  Without letting go of each other try to open.  They say, no, we can't.  I said, how do you open?  Peace and there.  And if you just like thare, nobody can hit them.  That's my advice to those kids and to those fathers, please, give a little time to your kid.  If you're gonna take three or four hours off, take two and a half or three and a half hour, and give a half an hour to your kid.  Talk to them, be, be frank with them.  Sometimes these kids who start to grow a little bit, and they have a different idea or they might talk a little bit funny, you no like it.  You get a little bit tough, but you have to be concerned. They change, they age, teenage.  You hurt, sometimes you want to cry, the tongue they give you some time, but this is beautiful when this kid come on this day, he said, daddy or mom, I'm sorry.  Yesterday, I act a little bit tough, but, you know, I don't mean it.  I mean, so, we have to take a lot of those, and I think a lot of fathers talking about raising arm, no, no raise your arm.  The kid, no hit him; talk to him.  That's the word, it's better than raising your arm.  If you raise your arm, the respect is going away a little bit.  No do it, just talk and that's more deep if you hurt somebody.  So, or punishment, so, but no hurting, and give it time, your kid, and this will happen here.  So but it's like a little (unclear) my wife, she love him, she love (unclear), good.  Sometimes she tough, but the chief, what can you do?  (Unclear) So I just watch, and I watch the rest of the kid.  I think we have good kid, very good.  Now, he's in Washington [D.C.], and we miss him like the devil.  He left two days ago.  He'll come today.  He was, a school trip, he (unclear) go White House and every place.  So that's why our kid, he back tonight.  He's eighteen years old.  So, but he's tall, sometimes, he's looking around, and say, ghee, I get old or the kid grow up?  But we enjoy.
Speaker 2: (unclear) thank you, Mr. Minoso.

Speaker 1: Truly, I like him.  I think the photographer do a good favor because some time I look like (unclear), well, wait a minute.  I come from Hollywood, something or I going to Hollywood.  I don't know exactly what day, but this picture was taken maybe around the '60s [1960s] or '70-something [1970-something] because it might be taken second picture, but that was one of the great picture that he ever taken.  I never give any compliment, good for myself, but I give it to the photographer.  He do a good job, so you looking pretty good, kid.  So you used to be pretty good looking guy, that's me. So.

Speaker 2: Okay, very good.  Next, please.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Well, this one, tough remembering.  This is when I got hurt in the head in New York.
Speaker 1: You were hit by a pitch?
Speaker 2: Right.  So they asked a new game, and the guy who hit me was Bob Grim, who year before he was the rookie of the year.
