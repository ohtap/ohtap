Asfaha: [00:00:00] My name is Dina Asfaha with the Stanford Historical Society’s
Oral History Program. I am here today, Wednesday, July 25th, 2017, at the
Stanford University campus office of the Director of Leadership Initiatives
and Special Projects at the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate
Education, Dr. Bernadine Chuck Fong. We are conducting this interview as
part of the Graduate Diversity at Stanford University Oral History Project.
Bernadine, I’d like to begin by asking you to tell me about where you
grew up.
Fong: I was born and raised in Palo Alto and grew up in a house on Stanford
Avenue, which obviously is right near the university. I’ve lived here almost
all of my life. I went to college obviously at Stanford. So I did not really go
anywhere--did not live out of state anywhere--until one year after school
when I got a job elsewhere.1
[00:00:59] I went to a Catholic elementary school and then Palo Alto
High School, and then on to Stanford.

I moved to Ventura, in southern California, for a teaching position at Ventura College, but only stayed there a
year.

Asfaha: And who raised you? What did they do, and what were their educational
backgrounds?
Fong: I was with my parents. I was an only child. They raised me. Their
background--my father was also a Stanford graduate. He got his bachelor’s
and master’s and PhD at Stanford. He was born in Hawaii. He came here to
go expressly to school. He started out at UC Berkeley, actually, for one
semester and then came to Stanford for the rest of his undergraduate work
and then started his own lab. He was a research chemist.
My mother went to UC Berkeley, and then she was in biology, I think
molecular biology or something like that.
When I was growing up, my father had his own research lab where
he was not doing pure research, but making products. He was actually an
organic chemist, and so he was making a vitamin concentrate for poultry
and also developed the cure for coccidiosis, which was an avian disease, and
was successful in that.
[00:02:15] Meanwhile, my mother was very much a stay-at-home
mom until I was in high school, and then she started to work. She worked I
think it was--I can’t remember if it was full time or part-time over at the
Stanford Hospital. But when I was growing up as a child, she was definitely
at home.
When I was going to school--I would add that my father was the one
who drove. My mother did not drive at all. And so going to school, I was
always taken either by car pool and/or by my father. So though I was very
close to my mother, I also became very close with my father.

14

Asfaha: So you talked a little bit about going to school here in the Stanford area.
What were your schooling experiences like, leading up to Stanford?
Fong: [00:03:04] Well, I’m going to back up a little bit. Actually, the first school I
went to was a nursery school, and it was a private Catholic nursey school
over in Menlo Park. It was called Sacred Heart. Sacred Heart still exists. And
it was taught by French nuns. I was there for nursery school, and it was an
all-day affair. They picked me up by bus.
It was my first time away from home, so I lasted there only a few
weeks. I got too homesick, and I cried every day. The irony was my parents
had selected that school because they knew that I liked horses, and they had
a pony at the school. So [my parents] were trying to--I remember this like
yesterday. They were trying to entice me and say, “Oh, well, look at the
pony.” This is at the school. But I remember literally crying and crying
regardless of the pony standing there in front of me.
[00:03:57] So I basically dropped out of preschool, and then the
following year, they put me into a public school. It was called Mayfield
School, which was then on Page Mill and El Camino. I went there for a
year, and then from there, then I went into the Catholic elementary school.
What I remember of that was we were the first first grade to go
through the school. The school went from first through eighth grade. So it
was a class of fifty students with one nun and no teacher aides or anything
else. We were frankly very well behaved, all things considered, but we also
became very close as a class.
What’s interesting is this is in the 1950s that I was going to

15

elementary school, and we still have mini reunions of our class to this day.
We call it either our First-Grade or Eighth-Grade Reunion. It depends on
what we decide to call it. But we were together eight years in the same
classroom.
[00:05:00] We don’t stay in touch on a day-to-day basis, but someone
will say, “Oh, gee, maybe it’s time we all get together.” So then I have a list
of everybody, and we e-mail everybody, and we all get together. The last one
we had a reunion was last year, and there’s probably about fifteen or twenty
of us that got together with our spouses.
Then when we get together, it’s like no time has passed. It’s just like
we’re all old friends. Yet we don’t stay in contact. I haven’t talked to them
or seen them since the last reunion, but we’ll all get back in touch.
So that was an unusual experience, and I think between that, living in
the house that I grew up in--I’ve only lived in two houses my entire life, the
one I live in now and the one that I lived in when I grew up. So it’s given
me an extremely, extremely stable community and sense of self and
everything else.
[00:05:53] And then being Catholic and being in a Catholic school, I
was the only Asian--I mean the only Chinese, much less anyone of color in
the whole school. I was also used to being--I used to call it that I was
Catholic, I was Chinese, and I was left-handed, so that I was a minority in
three ways. I took great pride in being that.
I also remember, since my name was “Bernadine”--everybody else
was named--the girls--they were either Kathleen or Susan. You’re either an

16

Italian Catholic or an Irish Catholic. So I really relished the fact that I was
“Bernadine” because the other girls, for example, would say, “I’m Susan
such and such,” or, “I’m Kathy such and such,” because otherwise there
was another Kathy or Susan. And I could just say, “I’m Bernadine,” because
there was only one of me. So I really enjoyed that, as well.
Asfaha: Going on to high school--you said you went to a Catholic high school?
Fong: I went to a Catholic high school for one year, ninth grade, and then I went
on to Palo Alto High School, which started in tenth grade. So when I went
to ninth grade--this was an all-girls high school--a number of the girlfriends
from my Catholic elementary school went with me.
[00:07:10] What’s interesting there was I was, frankly, having a great
time, and I remember one day as a freshman, because I was only there my
freshman year, that I was called in by the principal, the nun, Sister Mercedes.
I’ll never forget this.
She called me in, and she said, “You’re talking about going to
Stanford for college, and you need to know that Stanford is a secular school.
We don’t encourage students to go to a secular school.” Basically her
message was, “You shouldn’t talk about it.”
So I left, and I said, “Okay.” First of all, I didn’t know what “secular”
meant, so I didn’t know really what she was talking about. And then
secondly, I mentioned that to my parents. Soon after that, they said, “If you
want to change schools, it’s your decision. You’re welcome to change
schools if you want to go to Palo Alto High School.”
[00:08:09] Which was sort of a surprise to me, because I didn’t know

17

what caused this. I had told them obviously about my secular school
conversation, but I didn’t think anything of it, per se. But apparently my
parents had gone to a parent meeting--an all-parent meeting with the
principal--and the principal had said that their goal for the high school was
to educate the girls to become nuns.
Both of my parents were Catholic at the time, but I guess that kind of
rubbed them the wrong way. They didn’t tell me at the time, but later on
they told me that was why that they gave me this option, “Do you want to
go to the local high school?”
[00:08:54] And so then the high school was very close to where I
lived. I could have walked to school as opposed to having someone drive
me to the Catholic school. So I decided, kind of on a lark. I walked over to
Palo Alto High School, during the summer, and got a feel for the place and
thought, “Oh, yes, I could like it here.” And so then I changed, and it was
that simple.
But then when I went to high school--now of course, there were
many students, number one, and number two, a lot of students that were
very different than coming from a Catholic environment. So they not only
had different religions, but they were of different races.
I also remember being approached by a contingent of Chinese
students, and I literally remember backing away as they walked up to me
because I was, one, kind of surprised. I felt really awkward. I didn’t know
what to do.
They were wanting to befriend me, and for whatever reason I just felt

18

like--and this sounds terrible--but that I didn’t need to befriend them
because I knew what it was like to be Chinese. And I really felt that it was
important by being Chinese that I--I was probably Bernadine, Catholic,
Chinese and left-handed for a reason in life. So I probably needed to prove
myself and not with people like me. So while I was nice to them, I really
didn’t fraternize with them and made my own friends.
[00:10:22] While I was in high school, I followed in my dad’s
footsteps in chemistry. I took a lot of chemistry. But I also took a lot of art,
and I was able to experiment in a lot of different ways. I think I got a very
good education.
And of course just about everybody in school wanted to go to
Stanford. That was a big deal. In fact, I believe in my class something like
sixty or seventy of my class applied to Stanford, and that was not unusual.
About half of us got in. So it was a pretty high acceptance rate.
[00:10:56] Now granted a lot of Stanford faculty children were also at
Paly. So they probably got I think legacy or something, some kind of
privilege. It wasn’t legacy, it was some kind of employment--if you were a
Stanford staff member or something, you can get in or something like that.
Anyway, so I enjoyed my stay at Paly and then became pretty active
in some social clubs. Then I ended up being president of one of the girls
social clubs and had a really good time. And then obviously I went through
the whole college admissions process like everybody else and then ended up
at Stanford.
But I didn’t need to leave home, as it were, to go to college even

19

though I did end up living in a dorm. I didn’t have to travel any great
distance to get to Stanford.
Asfaha: [00:12:00] Was Stanford your first choice because your father went there?
Or how did you end up choosing it?
Fong: How I wanted to go to Stanford was because when I was in fourth grade,
for whatever reason, my father got me interested in football. So we were
going to football games, and he gave me a book. It was written by a football
coach on football and all the rules and regulations and all the referee hand
signals for football.
So I read that. I remember reading that book cover to cover in one
night. I just got totally engrossed in football. We would go to all the
Stanford football games. So my connection with Stanford and why I wanted
to go to Stanford was more because of football.
As I said, I told this nun in ninth grade that I wanted to go to
Stanford, and it was more because by ninth grade I had been going to
Stanford football games for five years because I had started when I was in
fourth grade. So I was already indoctrinated, as it were, into that. It wasn’t
that Stanford had a particularly good football team, but I enjoyed the sport.
So that was the first thing.
[00:13:03] Stanford was my first choice, and then USC was my
second choice because at that time it would have been easier to get into
USC. It was my second choice because it did have a good football team. So
I figured if I didn’t get into Stanford, I’ll just go to USC and just have a
good time and just go to football games. So I didn’t have any esoteric reason

20

for what I wanted to study or anything like that when I first applied [to
Stanford].
But then I have to say when I looked--years later, I looked at my
application, and it said something about “I wanted to be”--this surprised
me. It said something about “I wanted to be a”--well, they called it a junior
college, but that “I wanted to be a junior college teacher.” It said it on my
freshman application, which surprises me to this day because I don’t ever
remember knowing what that was, what a junior college even was, because I
hadn’t set foot on one at that time. And that I wanted to go in psychology.
It said that, too. So I was sort of surprised about that.
Asfaha: [00:14:11] And so you came to Stanford, and you did your bachelor’s here in
psychology. Was there a specific reason why, or do you remember what
piqued your interest in child development and psychology?
Fong: Well, this sounds really superficial, but it’s true. I picked my major at the
end of our sophomore year when we were facing this deadline that we had
to decide on a major. I was dating a fellow, another student here at
Stanford, who was in the same class as me.
He said he was going to pick psychology because something about--it
had the least number of requirements or something like that. I thought that
sounded like a good idea, so that’s what I did. The irony of that is because
my only psychology course that I had taken at that point was Psych I, and I
had gotten a C-plus in it. So it wasn’t like I was doing great in psychology,
but I picked it.
[00:15:15] But then what happened was in my junior year I took

21

developmental psych. I think it was called Child Psych at the time, Psych
111--I’ll never forget this--from Eleanor Maccoby. It turned my life around.
I just loved it. It really opened my eyes.
She was a marvelous professor, a marvelous teacher. I’m still in touch
with her today. She’s ninety-nine years old. I had lunch with her a few
months ago. She was just so inspirational. She, I think was instrumental, and
I don’t think she even realized it, I was just a student sitting in her class.
[00:15:52] But she was really inspirational to me, and what she was
talking about in terms of the development, particularly the cognitive
development, of children, really impressed me, so much so that I knew I did
want to stay in psychology. I wanted to go into child psychology per se,
which I did.
I ended up teaching child psychology when I was at Foothill. I used
some of the same activities with my students that she used with us, in terms
of working with young children and administering some psychological test
to assess their cognitive development. So she was a huge influence on me.
So that’s how I ended up in the field, and I then had to think about
graduate school or I had to think about what I was going to do because
when you get a bachelor’s in child psychology, frankly there isn’t an awful
lot you can do. Clearly for me it would be to go to graduate school.
[00:16:48] Somehow, and I don’t quite remember, but I met Edith
Dowley. So Edith Dowley was a professor in the School of Education and
head of Bing Nursery School at Stanford. This was fairly new, at that time, a
new research lab preschool.

22

So in talking with her, two things--I applied for the master’s program,
which was in psychological studies in the School [of Education]. The reason
I had to do that was when I talked to Professor Maccoby, she said that I
couldn’t apply for the master’s program in psychology at Stanford because
the department, frankly most of the departments, they don’t encourage
undergrads to get their advanced degrees in the same department because
they feel like, in her words, “We’ve taught you everything we know. You
need to go to another university for your advanced degree.”
Well, I didn’t want to go to another university. I somehow discovered
the psychological studies in the School of Ed. I applied there, and then
that’s when I met Edith Dowley. So then she said, “Well, we can give you a
TAship at Bing Nursery School. If you work there as a TA, then you can
basically have your tuition taken care of while you get your master’s.” So
that’s what I did.
[00:18:09] So I worked there for I guess it was two years, because I
graduated with undergrad in 1966, and 1968 I got my master’s. I had a
wonderful time. I learned a lot. Edith Dowley was a wonderful professor as
well and really nurtured me.
Then, of course, I had a really good experience, firsthand, in working
with young children, but I realized that that wasn’t something I wanted to
do with the rest of my life. So then the question is, “Well, what do I do
now?” And so that’s when the community college option came up.
I have to tell you that I had considered a doctorate, but my father had
scared the daylights out of me because he had said--he’d gotten his

23

doctorate, and he had said to me somewhere in my educational career,
“Well, if you get a doctorate, any professor in the university can sit on your
dissertation committee when you do your defense and ask you a question.”
[00:19:10] And that just scared me half to death. I thought, “Oh, I
don’t want to be in that situation where in my oral defense of my
dissertation, anybody could show up from the campus and ask me a
question.” So I did not purposely go for a doctorate at that time.
So I had this master’s, and then I applied for various teaching jobs. I
had never taught. And when I was still--let’s see, I had gotten my master’s,
and I was still at Bing. Then I did get a call from San Francisco City College
to teach a child development class that they had at night. They had a lastminute cancellation from the instructor, and so could I “start next week.”
So I got the book and boned up on it and ended up going to my first class.
It was a three-hour class once a week.
[00:20:03] What I remember was, in those days you could ask
students not only who they are and why they’re in the class, but their age.
For whatever reason I wanted to know their age. So I passed these index
cards around, and they gave me all this information. I remember that I
realized that after reading all these index cards I was the second-youngest in
the class. Everybody else was older than me.
I cannot believe I did this, but what I ended up doing--and I think
this is from my Catholic upbringing--anyone I thought in the class that was
younger than me, I called them by their first name. If they appeared to be
older than me, I called them by their last name.

24

So it’d be either Mr. So-and-So or Mrs. So-and-So. I could not bring
myself to call a person that I thought was older than me, to call them by
their first name. I’m not sure the students noticed it. No one ever pointed it
out to me or wondered about it, but I remember doing that.
[00:21:01] But I also remember that the first night that I taught the
class, it was a huge epiphany. It was like the curtains being drawn open on
the stage, and I could see backstage. It was like, this is clearly what I wanted
to do, and I absolutely loved it. It was a huge, pivotal experience for me
even though I was inching my way into this career, but without any really
methodical approach to it or any dream about it. But once I did it, I knew
this was what I wanted to do the rest of my life, and so I did.
Asfaha: Wow. Going back to your father’s experience and his approach to graduate
school, I was interested--I know you said that he--well, I guess maybe he
didn’t intentionally try to make you afraid about the doctoral path, but you
ended up feeling that way. But did he at all encourage you aside from telling
you what it was like to have professors on your dissertation committee?
Fong: [00:22:18] That’s the only thing from either my mother or my father--that’s
the only thing I remember my dad saying. I wouldn’t even say that he was
discouraging me. He just said it as a matter of fact. It wasn’t like a threat
saying, “Oh, if you do that, this will happen.” It was not that way at all. It
was just like, “Oh, you know,” and it was just sort of a statement. I don’t
think he had any intention behind it one way or another.
Both my parents were very supportive of my education. They didn’t
influence me in terms of, “Oh, you need to be a this,” or, “You need to be a

25

that,” at least not that I can remember.
[00:22:55] I remember, maybe, it would have been my mother, but
maybe [her] saying something about, “If you go into teaching, you get
summers off,” or something. But I do know that was on my mind, getting
summers off. So when I did start teaching fulltime, I didn’t teach during the
summer for a number of years because the whole idea was that you got
summers off.
But they were pretty open to what I wanted to do. But I don’t think
he said that as a negative. I don’t even know to this day whether he even
realized that that’s why I didn’t go for a doctorate right away.
Asfaha: Wow. [laughs] It was 1968 when you finished your master’s program and
you went to teach at a junior college. So you then went and did your PhD.
You finished your PhD in 1983. What was the process for you between
actually teaching and making the decision to apply to your doctoral
program?
Fong: [00:24:05] So this is a real funny story, and it’s true. I applied for teaching
positions, and there were a number of colleges around here where I had
some interviews, but then they withdrew the position. I thought I was going
to get a position at Marin College across the bay, and then they canceled the
position. And Foothill, which was the closest college here, had no positions
open at the time.
So the only position that was open that I got, was down in Ventura
College. This is Southern California. This was a big deal because now I’m
moving very far away from home and being by myself and all this. Even

26

though I’d lived on campus, that was the only other time I had lived on my
own, so to speak.
[00:24:50] So I took the position at Ventura and was down there for a
year, but in the meantime I would continue to apply for positions up here,
because I figured I would only go there temporarily. In fact, I was so clear
of that, that I wouldn’t date anybody when I was down in Ventura for fear
that I might end up in a relationship and then I might not want to move
back. So I purposely wouldn’t date anybody.
I met another faculty member there, a really nice woman also in the
Psychology Department, an older woman. She kind of semi-adopted me. I
had people to hang out with, and so it wasn’t like I was totally isolated. And
I had my dog. I had a collie--I still have collies to this day--I brought my dog
down there and so forth.
I had a great time in Ventura, and I think Ventura was probably the
best place for me to start as a new teacher because the faculty were very
friendly, very warm, and very accommodating.
What’s interesting, when I applied for that position and went down
there for the interview, one of the last processes is you meet with the
president. I remember the first thing the president said to me is something
to the effect, “Oh, well, I went to Stanford as well.”
[00:26:04] So I thought, “Oh, that’s a big help.”
When I was there, though, I again applied for positions elsewhere up
here. Foothill had a position. I came up for the interview for the Foothill
position sometime probably in the spring. It was interesting because I went

27

in to see the dean for the interview, and he said the same thing. He said,
“Oh, well, I got my graduate degree at Stanford.”
So I thought, “Oh, I have kind of an in,” just because they were
reaching out to me. It was an interesting interview because there was only
one other person. There wasn’t a committee. There was one other faculty
member there.
Then the dean took me for a walk around the campus. I found it very
interesting during the walk because he said, “Well, you’re young and
attractive. Is there anyone else in your life?” Basically he wanted to know if I
had some significant other and would I end up getting married and moving
away. He didn’t quite ask it that way, but he asked.
[00:27:07] And I said, “No, there’s no one that I’m serious about.”
Then he walked me into the vice president’s office. At that time, I think
they were just much more transparent about things. When he introduced me
to the vice president, he just said, “This is Bernadine Chuck,” what I was at
the time. “We’re very interested in this candidate.” So just like that, they
tipped their hand. Fortunately, I got the position.
And then a funny story with that was then I got the letter from the-so there’s the president of the college, but then there’s the chancellor for the
whole district. It was Foothill and De Anza Colleges. So I got a letter from
Cal Flint, who was the chancellor. He writes me saying, “Congratulations.
Welcome to the Foothill family,” and all this. At the end of his letter, he
says, “Since we really want to be a family, please call me ‘Cal.’”
[00:28:07] So the funny thing is on the first day of school, there was

28

this convocation for all of the faculty and staff and all of the administrators.
Cal was there, and then he had a reception at his home. So we all go to his
home to visit, and I’m ready now--remember, I am the person who cannot
call anybody who is older than me by their first name. So I was trying to
figure out how to say, “Hi, Cal.”
I’m getting ready to do that when I’m in this receiving line, and he
holds out his hand and says, “Hello, I’m Dr. Flint.” [laughs]
So I thought, “Oh, okay.” I remember telling a faculty colleague that
with me. I told him my story about this, how I couldn’t call him “Cal” and
then this happened.
And he said, “Oh, you should have asked him where Cal was.” [both
laugh] And I have to say when I was at Ventura I did the same thing. All the
older students I called them by their last name.
[00:29:00] Anyway, so I ended up at Foothill, and I just loved it. But
it was a harder school if you were a brand-new faculty member. People, it
didn’t appear to me, to be as friendly. There wasn’t any real orientation. You
didn’t get any tour to say, “This is where the coffee machine is. This is
where the mailroom is,” and whatever else.
So I was glad that I was at Ventura so that I knew which kinds of
questions to ask. But I loved it at Foothill, and I loved teaching there.
Let’s see, a couple things happened. I’m not even sure why, but I got
involved in at that time it was AFT [American Federation of Teachers],
which was the union. It was an AFT chapter of the teachers union. It wasn’t
like I was a union person, but somehow I got involved, and I think I was

29

even the treasurer or something like that. So I got involved in that.
[00:29:55] And then later on somebody asked if I wanted to run for
being the president of the faculty senate. I hadn’t been involved in the
faculty senate, but I thought, “Okay, sure, I can run.” Well, I got elected by
one vote, and I beat the person who had been known--he was a known
quantity. He had been I guess president before, and so I beat this fellow out
and then all of a sudden I was president of the Academic Senate, which
actually was a great experience for me.
Then in that year that I served as president, the president of the De
Anza Senate contacted me and he said he was interested in writing a
whitepaper to start an independent faculty union. So then I coauthored the
whitepaper with him to start this independent faculty union, which still
exists today.
[00:30:51] And this is all to say by the time I ended up being an
administrator, this all came to help me because I had already been, if you
would, one of them as being a faculty member, having been a senate faculty
president. Then when the union would come to me, now that I was an
administrator, I could say, “Well, I’m your ‘mother,’ because I’m the one
who helped start you.” So they couldn’t really accuse me about being
antiunion or whatever. So it really helped me in my role.
But in answer to your question, also how did I end up with a
doctorate was after six years of teaching, then I became eligible for
sabbatical. The easiest way to get a sabbatical was to go back to school. You
could write a proposal, you’re going to do this or that or whatever, but the

30

easiest one for approval was to go back to school.
So then I thought, “Okay, I need to go back to school. I’m going to
bite the bullet. I’m going to do the doctorate. I need to do it at Stanford,”
because I didn’t want to move at that point. Let’s see, at that point I was
married because I started at Foothill in 1970. I got married in 1972. So then
I started thinking about this doctorate.
[00:32:00] So as I was applying for the doctorate, then I had to figure
out how to overcome this fear about the defense of the dissertation. There
happened to be an administrative position that came open, and the position
was to open up a Palo Alto campus for Foothill, like a satellite campus in
downtown Palo Alto.
I knew at the time that there was already a favored candidate that was
someone that they were grooming, a faculty member who had done some
administrative work. He had been a summer school coordinator and things
like that. They actually in fact delayed the position. Instead of opening it for
fall, they opened it for winter because this fellow was on sabbatical and he
wouldn’t be back until winter to interview and all that business.
So I applied for the position, and I thought this would be a good way
to practice for my defense of my dissertation because I hadn’t been in an
interview since I had first gotten my teaching job. Going in front of the
interview committee would be similar to going in front of a dissertation
committee, and so this would be a good way to practice. So that’s how I
went into the whole process.
[00:33:09] Well, lo and behold, the favored son and another

31

candidate, who also had administrative experience, apparently they canceled
each other out in the interview committee. They couldn’t come to a
consensus, so I ended up getting selected to be this dean of the Palo Alto
campus, which I had no intention of becoming.
And so when the president called me and congratulated me, et cetera,
I frankly was mortified. At the same time, fortunately I didn’t say, “Oh, well,
I’m sorry. I was just practicing for my dissertation,” because that would not
be cool.
[00:33:46] So I talked to my husband, and I cried. I was just so upset.
We said, well, I didn’t want to be flakey, so I should probably just take the
position and do it for three years and then I could go back to teaching. So
that was the plan. In fact, I even said, “I’m going to take this position, but I
don’t want to give up my faculty office at Foothill.”
So I took the position, and that was in 1977. Frankly, I never went
back to teaching full time because then I went from one administrative
position to another and have found out that I really enjoyed it, and I felt like
I could make a difference. So I never got the sabbatical because now I’m in
this new job, but I did go to graduate school.
So I’m in the new administrative position. I was in Palo Alto, which
made it actually easier to attend classes at Stanford. I was going to school
and working simultaneously full time. And then at the same time I was
doing that, we had our first child, our son, and then I was also finishing a
textbook on child psychology.
Asfaha: Oh my goodness, you were so busy.

32

Fong: [00:34:58] So I was doing it all . People say, “Well, how did you do it?”
And I say, “You don’t know how much you can do until you set out
to do it.” I was very organized. Tuesdays and Thursdays I’d work on the
textbook, and then Monday/Wednesday/Friday I’d work on my
coursework or whatever it was.
And then my husband was really great about child care, so we shared
child care. But then whenever there was a time that we’d be going for a long
drive, let’s say to San Francisco or something, I always had something I was
doing in the car. I was either reading something or grading papers, whatever
it was. I’d be doing that.
Asfaha: Wow. So I’m guessing you getting that dean position is how you chose to go
into higher ed administration, choosing your doctoral program, right?
Fong: [00:35:50] No, because the doctoral program that I applied for was actually
before I got the dean’s position. But the doctoral program, it just seemed
like the lowest-hanging fruit of the doctoral programs that were available.
Remember, I couldn’t go back into psychology since I was an undergrad
here. So I thought, “Okay.” There was a doctoral program, and it was in
administration, let’s see, APA--Administration and Policy Analysis--and
then my minor was in psychology.
And then Stanford actually, it turns out, was very accommodating
because normally--I did go full time the first few quarters because I had to
take all these classes and then I had to pass a comprehensive exam. So I had
to go full time during that time, and after that I could go part time.
There was also a residency requirement that most graduate students

33

had to fulfill where you had to be enrolled “x” number of quarters on a full
time basis. Well, that got waived because I had already been full time as an
undergrad. They said, “You don’t need to be full time.” And so I had a lot
of accommodations in that way. Actually, it all worked out.
[00:37:05] When I was doing my dissertation, I had a wonderful
dissertation advisor. They were demanding, but not demanding to where I
couldn’t do my other job. So I never quit my other job. I worked the whole
time when I was doing my doctorate and raising a child, our son, and then
also finishing the textbook.
Asfaha: Wow. Did you have a chance to have any interactions with the faculty or
with your advisor--the person who ended up being your advisor-- prior to
entering your program? What were your expectations about what things
would be like aside from the dissertation process?
Fong: [00:37:51] Somewhere along the line, and I think it had to do with my being
in psychology, I learned to be very observant. In fact, when I was teaching
my child psychology class, one of the projects is--every student had to pick a
child under five years old and study them for six weeks, where they would
just do nothing but observe the child and everything they did. And I would
do the same thing.
One of the things that I learned was it’d be really important who you
pick for your dissertation committee and who chairs it. At that time there
was another woman in my program. She was at San Francisco City College,
and she had also gone back to school like me. There were two women,
actually, another woman who was from Chabot College. So there were the

34

three of us. We were all from community colleges in this program.
I remember one of them--they were both ahead of me because they
were maybe a year or so ahead, and so they were preparing for their
dissertation and their dissertation defense and getting their committees
together and all that business before me. But I would just watch what was
going on.
[00:39:08] One of them, she ended up going through her whole
process and went through her defense, and she comes out and she says it
was the most horrible experience that she had ever had. She said it was just
devastating. She just had all these words, and I’m thinking, “Oh my
goodness.”
But when she told me what had happened, as it turned out, she had a
junior professor who was head of her committee, and all the other people
on the committee, they were grilling him more than her. At least that’s the
impression that I got.
I came to the conclusion that when I picked my dissertation
committee and my chair that I wanted to get the most senior, respected
faculty member I could get. So that’s what I did. And so I went to Nate
Gage, and I don’t even remember if I even had a class from him, but he was
well respected.
[00:40:04] He knew nothing about community colleges. In fact, there
was only one faculty member who did know anything about community
colleges. So for my dissertation committee, I picked this one who was very
well respected, senior, the whole works, and then obviously surrounded him

35

with the other likely candidates to be on my committee.
Well, it was the best thing I ever did because he not only was a
wonderful advisor, he would even--when I would submit a draft to him or
something, he would edit it. Instead of telling me, “Oh, you need to explain
more of this,” and let me figure it out, he would actually edit it for me. So it
was really easy to correct my drafts because he had already done all of the
corrections while editing and everything else.
By the time I got to my dissertation defense, the big day now, I
decided, “Well, what am I most comfortable doing?” I’d been teaching now
for about seven years. I said, “I’m really comfortable teaching, and so I’m
going to make this like a class.”
[00:41:07] I went in ahead of time, and I outlined my whole
dissertation on the board. When the committee came in, I just went through
my whole dissertation like I’d be doing a lecture because I was comfortable
doing it. So I did that, and then I sat down. Then the first question I got was
from the dean of the school, and his question was--I will never forget this-“How did Prop. 13 affect community colleges?” This had nothing to do
with my dissertation. My dissertation was on faculty attitudes towards
grading. But Prop. 13, which was a huge piece of state legislation that
affected community colleges financially, had just passed. So that’s what was
on his mind.
That’s how the questions started. Once I got that question, I thought,
“Oh, this is going to be a piece of cake,” which it was because then I got
very few questions. There was no one from the outside, first of all, and then

36

I got very few questions that were at all challenging, as it were, from the rest
of the committee.
[00:42:11] So it turned out to be pretty easy, but had I not learned
from that classmate who had a horrible time, it could have been different.
But given that I had a senior--and this is my advice I give to graduate
students to this day. I say, “You want to get someone who is well respected.
Forget what the research is.”
Asfaha: Wow. You were a working mom and partly full time, partly part time
throughout your time here. Were you given any information about how
your graduate education, your doctoral program--how you would be
funded? Was there funding available?
Fong: [00:42:55] Huh. I kind of think I must have paid for it because I don’t
remember getting a fellowship or anything like that. This sounds strange. I
don’t really remember. So I guess I probably funded it myself and just paid
the tuition myself. That sounds about right, even though my master’s was
funded.
I don’t even remember looking for funding. So I’m not even sure, to
be honest with you, one, either that the funding was available in the School
of Ed at the time and/or if it was, I may not have known about it. I had
these two classmates who had been in the same situation, and I would have
thought if there was funding available that I would have learned it from
them if I didn’t know it myself.
I have a vague recollection that I probably paid for it, and it wasn’t

37

probably exorbitant at the time. Of course I had no living expenses because
I was already living here and so on and so forth.
Asfaha: [00:44:08] And so when I spoke with you at our preliminary meeting, we
also talked a little bit about what was going on in the broader US society
outside, zooming out of Stanford. In the 1960s, when you were here for
your undergraduate degree, the civil rights movement was going on, and
during your time here in your PhD program, the end of the Vietnam War-things were wrapping up, which brought a lot of controversy to campus.
Do you feel that that type of atmosphere had any type of major effect
on your experience here for graduate school?
Fong: I have to actually go back to undergrad because when I was in undergrad,
and it would have been--I was either a freshman or a sophomore. I can’t
remember now. It was when Kennedy was assassinated. So that stuck out in
my mind. And then Martin Luther King was assassinated somewhere, I
think probably when I was in graduate school.
[00:45:19] And the Vietnam War was emerging. David Harris, who
was a big--he was the student body president at the time, but he was a big
leader in the anti-Vietnam War movement. He was an undergraduate when I
was a graduate, I think. Something like that. It had an impact in some ways,
but I wouldn’t say--it certainly didn’t change my particular course of what I
was doing career-wise.
[00:45:47] But I remember with the Vietnam War that I was struck-because I went to a basketball game, and I was thinking to myself, “Well,
there are young men the same age as these basketball players, and they’re

38

out there on the battlefield.” Just the contrast of that, people who are able
to be privileged and go to school versus those who, for whatever reason
aren’t in school and therefore on the battlefield.
I know in my undergraduate class that there were those who were-mostly it was guys. They were in ROTC and so then they were going into
service whereas those others were protesters and/or actually in school that
they were frankly dodging the draft or getting a student deferment.
What I remember in graduate school was that there were a lot of
young men in the School of Ed that probably were there more because of
getting a draft deferment than that they wanted to go into education per se.
No one in particular comes to mind, but I just remember that kind of
impression.
[00:46:58] But at the time that I was in school, things were just
starting. They hadn’t really been full blown. So the whole Free Speech
Movement in Berkeley was happening.
But I think I was probably either in grad school or on my way out.
To be honest with you, I was so consumed with trying to do everything else
I was doing that I wouldn’t say that--aside from being aware, it was not like
I got involved. And I definitely was not directly impacted because no one in
my family went to the Vietnam War, for example, or no one was in a protest
or anything like that. But I was very much aware of what was going on.
[00:47:46] The other thing that did strike me, reflecting later, was that
the media was becoming much more--it had a greater presence. The
contrast that I had in my mind was when the whole revolution in China was

39

going on, the Communist Revolution in China, which was in the early
1960s, there was no media coverage of that. In retrospect I found that
fascinating because you had this huge cultural revolution going on that the
rest of the western world didn’t know anything about.
But then we were so much more aware of the Vietnam War, which
was obviously overseas as well, and then of course the civil rights movement
here. I kept track of the civil rights movement, but I can’t say I was involved
in it as such.
Asfaha: Going back to your experiences--I guess both your experiences in undergrad
and graduate school, how did they differ in terms of the people that you
were attending school with? So when you were in your doctoral program,
did you come in with a cohort? If so, what was your impression with regard
to diversity in the people that you were attending school with?
Fong: [00:49:15] This is a really good question because, I don’t know if it’s true
now, but I know that I had to come in with a cohort at the time for the
PhD program in particular. The master’s program was a little bit more
individualized. You kind of did your own thing and took your own classes,
and so I wouldn’t say I was in any cohort. But I was in a cohort with the
APA program because we were to take these classes in lockstep and then
have the comprehensive exam at the end.
Having said that, aside from these two women that I mentioned, I
could not tell you who else was in my cohort. I couldn’t even tell you at this
point what they looked like or who they were. I remember the classes I
took. I remember some of the professors that I had.

40

[00:50:03] But obviously I didn’t have any relationship with these
[students] since I have no clue at this point who they were. Clearly if I had
studied with them or something, I probably--I have no connection with
them that I know of, that continued at all.
The other thing, though, is I would have been relatively an older
student because I was working and then coming back to school. So that may
have been a factor. I wasn’t living on campus, obviously. And even graduate
students then who lived off campus, they would still congregate on campus
for activities. But I was married. I had a family. I was working. So I had all
these other things going on, and I didn’t feel particularly isolated. It was just
that I was just very busy. I think that was probably a factor.
[00:51:09] Well, it goes back to when I was a child. I enjoyed being
on my own and being different, being the only one of this or that or
whatever. I think that comes from my parents because when they came-they lived in San Francisco before I was born. And then World War II
broke out, and there was concern that San Francisco could be a target for
bombing after Pearl Harbor. So they decided to build in Palo Alto and
move to Palo Alto. They bought some property in Palo Alto and built a
house there, and that’s the house that I ended up growing up in.
But when they bought the property, they were visited by two families
who were in the neighborhood. One was a first-generation Italian family.
The other was a first-generation Portuguese family who came up to San
Francisco and said they did not want my parents to move into the
neighborhood because, by having Chinese in the neighborhood, it would

41

bring the value of the real estate down and so forth.
[00:52:09] The irony of that is because my parents were secondgeneration California or US. My dad was born in Hawaii and my mother
was born in San Francisco. That just made my parents all the more
determined that they would move there as opposed to shying away.
I think that attitude about, “Instead of circling around, I’m just going
to go right into the fire,” or whatever it is and be the only one--and I think
we were at that time one of only two or three Chinese families in Palo Alto.
So I kind of took pride in that, and I think that is what gave me a lot of
resilience and/or independence going forward.
[00:52:58] So then when these social justice issues came up like the
Vietnam War and the civil rights movement, my reaction, particularly with
the civil rights movement, was more, that being Chinese, I could probably
be pretty effective because frankly if I were African-American, I would look
like I already have a self-serving agenda. But if Chinese were promoting
other races, it’s a little bit different because I wasn’t promoting myself or my
own race. I’ve always thought that. I call it--let’s see, what’s the word I use?
“Persuasion by infiltration,” that if I can infiltrate to the majority group that
I could be more effective than if I just stayed with a minority group. To this
day I still think that, and I still do that.
Asfaha: [00:53:55] Wow. It definitely sounds like you had a unique experience. I’m
wondering what your support network was or who comes to mind in terms
of how you were able to get through being so busy and getting through your
doctoral program.

42

Fong: Well, my husband played a big role. He was the one who pushed me into
the program. The interesting thing is he’d never finished college, because he
went into the family business and just stayed in it.
I should go back and say he was the first one who instilled a lot of
confidence in me. It’s hard for people to believe this--I used to be extremely
shy, and I wouldn’t talk. I certainly wouldn’t speak up in a group. I
overcame that somewhat because as a teacher I had to speak in the
classroom. I loved that because I was in control of the whole thing, and I
really enjoy that.
[00:54:59] But then the second thing was that my husband had a
very--he is very pragmatic. I remember I’d be at a faculty meeting at
Foothill, and I was still faculty at the time, and then I’d come home. I felt so
bad because I said the wrong thing at a faculty meeting, and I’d be just
worried about it.
And my husband would say, “Well, too late now. You’ve already said
it. Now get over it.” That kind of attitude really helped me not to
perseverate over things I’d done in the past. So that was one thing.
And then the second thing was that he was very encouraging. He
really gave me a lot of confidence to go forward. If I’d been worried about,
“Well, gee, how am I going to do all this?”
“Oh, well, we’ll figure it out.” He wouldn’t sweat the details and so
forth. So it all just worked out. That’s why I think he was a big difference in
giving me that kind of confidence.
[00:56:01] And then, of course, he helped out. The nice thing is that

43

he liked to cook, and I personally didn’t like to cook. So he liked to cook,
and then he also--he was a bachelor for a number of years--so he knew how
to iron. He could do the wash. He could do all this other stuff.
It was just not a big deal, and we never had a problem about
marriages where there’s the stereotypic women’s chores and then the men’s
chores and so forth because he did it all. He talks about when he was in
fourth grade he used to iron his pants before going to school and wearing
them to school. He would never wear jeans. He always wore these slacks,
and he’d iron them.
Asfaha: Wow. [both laugh]
Fong: I know. We’ve been retired. We both retired about the same time. He’s
really retired. I have since obviously taken on other jobs. I really haven’t
cooked for about ten years now because he does all the cooking. He enjoys
it. He was in the grocery business, so he loves going to grocery stores. He
loves going to Costco. So it just fits right in. I don’t like to do any of that.
[both laugh]
Asfaha: [00:57:10] Lucky you. It worked out.
Fong: Exactly.
Asfaha: So that was your support network outside of Stanford. When it came to
being in the Stanford community, can you describe your relationship with
your primary advisor during your time here?
Fong: Before my dissertation, I had my program advisor, who was Lewis Mayhew,
and he was a very nice man. He was the one who would teach a course on
community colleges even though he’d never been to one or worked at one

44

or whatever.
He was helpful in the beginning, and he was the one who, when I
was thinking about--so he was my advisor for my master’s, but when I was
thinking about the PhD, he was the one who seemed to cut the red tape
about, “Well, Stanford had this policy.” Like I said, you had to be in
residence for so long. He was able to figure all that out for me.
[00:58:07] Then when it came to the dissertation, though, that’s
when--since I had this epiphany I needed to get somebody who was really
well respected. Professor Mayhew, while he was there as senior faculty for a
long time, he was not really well respected. I shouldn’t say that. He was
really not, well--yes, he wasn’t well known for any research. He really hadn’t
done a whole lot of research. So I somehow got the sense that probably he
shouldn’t be my dissertation advisor.
So that’s when I went to Nate Gage, and Nate Gage, he wrote the
handbook on teaching, and he wrote all of these books that were based on
research and so on and so forth. And also my dissertation was going to be
on teaching. So it made sense for me to talk to him, and it may even be that
Lew Mayhew had suggested that I consult with him.
[00:59:00] He was extremely helpful and very supportive, and he
really wanted to, I think, see everybody to be successful. He was not at all
pompous or anything like that. As I said earlier, he was the one who would
actually edit my drafts as opposed to just telling me to rewrite them.
And then he got to a point where he was going to go on sabbatical
himself to be in England. So then he was the one who just said, “Well, we

45

need to get your dissertation done because I am going to be gone,” and so
on and so forth as opposed to letting it drag out. So he was extremely
helpful to me.
Then there were staff members at the school who were helpful just
to--I don’t know if there was any red tape about registration or getting
classes or whatever, but I think it was mostly the major advisor or the
dissertation advisor that was helpful.
[00:59:58] When you propose your dissertation, you have a smaller
committee, and so I had two people, Mike Kirst and Ed Bridges. I just had
lunch with Mike Kirst yesterday. So I still stay in touch with him. He’s
emeritus here at Stanford. They were also very helpful.
There was I think one female in the higher ed faculty, Elizabeth
Cohen. But I had all males for my dissertation committee. I had no women
except when I was in the master’s. Then I had Edith Dowley.
Asfaha: Did you find it at all difficult to navigate being in your doctoral program, or
did you receive any coaching or mentoring that allowed you to better
navigate your experience in your program?
Fong: [01:01:02] Well, the main one is the one I said where a classmate of mine
had had a horrible experience that I learned what not to do. I think that was
the big one.
In my career, my mentors--it was interesting because I had mentors
who were unsuccessful in their role. So I learned what not to do as much as
learning from people what to do. Again, I think it goes back to being really
observant of individuals.

46

When I was at Foothill and I was a faculty member and then I got
this first administrative job, the president at the time was not well liked and
not well respected. He was a very nice man. For whatever reason, I ended
up being like a favored child because, when I was in this administrative
position, then in any administrative meeting he’d always cite, “Well,
Bernadine did this,” or, “Bernadine did that.”
[01:02:12] I knew that was not a good thing for me and my
colleagues, so I would always try to keep a low profile. I also remember that
I would purposely not sit near him because I didn’t want to look like
somehow we were colluding or something.
But that also helped me because I’m very cognizant even to this day,
if I go into a meeting or go into any kind of event or even a social event,
about where I physically position myself given what the politics of the room
can be or what the dynamics of the room could be. So do I want to be
associated or should I be associated? Could I be more effective if I’m
opposite, on the other side of the room, as opposed to next to let’s say an
individual who is, let’s say, leading the meeting or whatever else? So I’m very
much aware of that.
[01:03:05] But I learned a lot from [the president], and he was a
mentor in the sense that he kept telling me when I was in my dissertation
program, “Make sure that you finish your dissertation.” I mean when I’m in
my doctoral program. “Make sure you finish your dissertation.” So it was
very clear to me I couldn’t be an ABD [All But the Dissertation]. In that
sense, he was very, very helpful.

47

Then his successor, who became my predecessor as president, he also
was a mentor. Again, I learned what to do--I learned a lot from him, but I
also learned what not to do from him because the nice thing is when you’re
more of an observer, you also know--when you have this mentor who is the
leader, you know how their leadership style is coming across to other people
and how it’s being received.
[01:03:57] So I would learn, “Well, Tom did this, and he thought he
was going to have this effect, but maybe he had the opposite effect.” I
learned a lot from that as well, but I still take that back to psychology and
just being extremely observant and then trying to see the whole picture.
Asfaha: Absolutely. Do you remember any particular, major challenges of your time
in your program here?
Fong: Well, when I think about it, I’m amazed that I got through. I’ll tell you why,
because in those days--well, two things. My dissertation was on faculty
attitudes and their grading policies and their grading practices, actually.
When I think about it now, it’s kind of amazing. I managed to get faculty
from both Foothill and De Anza to agree to be part of my research project
and that they would share their grades with me and that they would take this
personality inventory. It’s just kind of amazing that they would do all this.
[01:05:13] As I recall, they took the personality inventory, and then
the students took--so there was an inventory called MMPI. It was
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. So the faculty took it, and
then the students took it. They were willing to administer it to their
students, as I recall.

48

It was looking at faculty attitudes towards their students, the
students’ attitudes towards their faculty, and then the grades and whether
there was any correlation. What’s surprising about all of that--because this is
in the days of punch cards. Do you even know what punch cards are?
Asfaha: I don’t. You’ll have to explain that to me.
Fong: [01:05:56] You would answer a survey on a card where you fill in dots, and
then the computer would read these cards and then punch where there was
the dot filled in.
Asfaha: Kind of like a Scantron?
Fong: Like a Scantron except before Scantron, okay? They were called punch
cards. Then you could run these cards. And I remember, I had, I guess a lot
of students, because I remember something like seven thousand punch
cards that the Stanford computer would run for me. I’m sort of amazed
even as I describe this to you that I managed all this data with those punch
cards. So that was number one.
Number two, this is before personal computers. There were
computers, and there was--what did we call it in those days? The equivalent
of Word, but the predecessor to Word2, the software Word.
[01:06:56] So you’d have to go to the computer center and write your
dissertation. So the nice thing was at the computer center, they had
everything formatted. You didn’t have to worry about size and page margins
and all that. It’s all formatted, but you had to still enter everything and do
your data analysis.

Word Processing
49

And so when I did all of that, I remember that I would be--I could be
here all night. I remember one night my husband came. He came looking
for me because I hadn’t come home. I didn’t realize what time it was, and it
was about three or four o’clock in the morning.
So he came looking for me. Then he found me in the computer
center. So then he ended up lying on a table and fell asleep while I was still
doing my computer work. So that’s my biggest recollection, actually, of
doing that dissertation.
The irony is that Nate Gage liked it so much that he said that I really
should become a researcher and not do what I was doing, which was at that
point obviously community college administration, because, “You’d be a
really good researcher.” But I didn’t want to do that.
Asfaha: [01:08:08] Wow. It seems like it was definitely difficult for you when it came
to time and having to get all of these things done. But did you feel
academically well prepared for your program?
Fong: That’s a good question. I think so. I’m making it sound so serendipitous,
but it really was because there weren’t--if there were any challenges, I don’t
think I ever saw them as being, ever that they were insurmountable. So as
far as being prepared, I think I was--I don’t recall where I felt like I was
going to be academically in trouble or that I was possibly going to fail a
class.
[01:09:11] What I do remember, and I’m kind of even surprised to
this day, I went back one time with my transcript, both undergrad and
graduate. I had taken seven statistics classes. I remember that I loved

50

decision analysis, and I got really involved in probability. I had never taken a
math class in college in my whole life, but I really got involved in that and
really loved it.
The irony is I consult right now for LaGuardia Community College,
and the IR person there was my stat teacher here when I was a graduate
student. He was a TA or something at the time.
[01:09:50] So I don’t remember having any--I shouldn’t say I didn’t
have any difficulty, but I don’t remember that anything felt insurmountable
or that I was up at night worrying about something. I remember when I was
an undergrad in chemistry staying up all night trying to pass an organic
chem test, but I don’t remember anything in graduate school being that
horrible.
But again, I think I was just so busy that I just had to stay focused all
the way along and just be very efficient. That helped me I think as an
administrator later on because I knew how to time manage. I knew where I
could do work simultaneously.
That even goes back to when I was a child. My parents, they weren’t
terribly strict on me. I didn’t have a set bedtime and so on. I remember that
they allowed me to do my homework and watch TV. I think that really
helped me because I could multitask. So to this day I can multitask, I think
because of that.
Asfaha: [01:10:57] Wow. That sounds like your time management was definitely a
strategy for survival. Do you have any major memorable moments from
your time here as a PhD student or as a master’s student?

51

Fong: Hm. Well, I remember, frankly, I was having a good time I think just
because that was just part of the whole Stanford aura, being at Stanford. I
remember just everything--well, I was having a good time.
I remember in my classes, depending upon the class, that--if there
were classes on let’s say, what would it be, history of education or things
that I really didn’t know about, then I really soaked it all up.
[01:12:05] If there were classes on administration, and I was now
working as an administrator, then there were times when I probably felt like
I probably could have contributed as a teacher or a lecturer to that class as
much as the professor or whoever was leading the class just because I was
actually in the field and they weren’t.
But other than that, all of my memories are really just positive. I
don’t remember anything that was negative aside from my friend’s
experience that I knew I didn’t want to replicate.
Asfaha: So what was it like? You were already in your administrator position at
Foothill while you were part-time here. So after finishing with your
dissertation defense, what was it like to officially transition from doctoral
student to PhD in your position at Foothill?
Fong: [01:13:15] So the truth of the matter is it made no difference at all because the
position that I was in did not require a doctorate. So I had it, and it was nice to
have, but it didn’t make any difference. In fact, I don’t even think--did I even
get a salary increase because of it? I’m not even sure.
As a faculty member, I would have gotten a salary increase being a
doctor. I don’t think as an administrator you got a salary increase based on

52

having a doctorate. You might have, but I just don’t remember it. But it wasn’t
significant. It was a nice thing to have.
[01:13:59] Now what’s important is--let’s see, by the time I got the
doctorate, which was 1983, I was probably in my second administrative job,
because I was the dean in Palo Alto for three years, and then I was still in my
doctorate program. Then I got my next job, which was vice president for
administrative services. So now I was in charge of the budget and a lot of HR
activities and things like that. It was probably in that job that I actually was
awarded the PhD.
I don’t recollect whether that made a difference or not. Where it came
in handy, and I use that word purposely, is because then from that job I went
into--it was actually a lateral move. I went into being the vice president for
instruction. It’s like being the provost here or head of academic affairs and so
on.
[01:15:08] So when I got that job, again the PhD wasn’t required, so I
was fine except then ultimately when the president announced he was going to
retire, and then I proceeded to apply for that job. Then that’s when the PhD
became important even though it wasn’t required, it was certainly desired.
Now I was glad that I’d had it and I had already gotten it. I didn’t have
to go try to get it or something like that. So that’s probably the only time where
having the doctorate made a difference, and I was glad I had a PhD instead of
an EdD.
Asfaha: Can you talk a little bit about why it was maybe more preferable to have a
PhD as opposed to the EdD there?

53

Fong: [01:15:57] One of my early dissertation committee members, Ed Bridges,
said to me early on--because I was asking which I should get--he said, “Get
the PhD. Don’t get the EdD, because the EdD is more practical. The PhD
is more research.” He didn’t say it in so many words, but I think the
translation was it’s more prestigious than an EdD.
He said, “Since you’re going to spend the same amount of time--”
This is exactly what he said. “You’re going to spend the same amount of
time in school. You might as well just get the PhD.” So that’s what I did.
But I now was glad to have it because I don’t think it was the decision point,
but it certainly helped in becoming president because then I had the
doctorate.
[01:16:41] But I had never aspired to be president at all, and so it was
sort of happenstance as I was the vice president. I’d been the vice president
now in this position for academic affairs for eleven years. I was just fine and
really enjoying it. But then I really applied for the president’s position more
frankly out of self-defense. Because it occurred to me, well, if I didn’t apply
for it and someone else got the position, I’d probably know more about
running that college than the new person, and yet I’m not the president. So
I thought I’d better at least apply to be the president since I had all this
wealth of knowledge.
It sort of was an uphill battle because historically the tradition usually
is that you don’t end up in the same institution for your whole
administrative career because you make enemies along the way. You lay
somebody off. You fire somebody. You cut somebody’s budget. You make

54

enemies as an administrator, and so usually administrators need to move
from institution to institution. And so I was blessed literally because I didn’t
have to move. My whole administrative career was at Foothill.
Asfaha: Can you talk a little bit about that interviewing process going from the vice
president position into applying for the president position?
Fong: [01:18:05] Well, several things happened. This is probably apropos also to
one of the purposes of this interview. I was first conflicted about whether I
wanted to apply. So two things. They had a search firm that was hired, and
so I was waiting for the search firm to contact me as a potential candidate.
Nobody contacted me. And so I thought, “Well, maybe they really
don’t want me, that this is kind of a hidden message here.” So I didn’t send
in my application until right before the deadline because I wasn’t so sure
that they wanted me since the search person never came to me. So that was
number one. I literally walked [the application] in like five minutes before
five o’clock or something.
[01:18:57] Then in the interview process--now I have these different
faculty camps, and they’re all nervous about who is going to be president
next. It came down to three finalists, and one was me, another one was an
African-American male, and another one was a white male.
I remember some of the faculty getting all nervous about, well, two
things. One, De Anza had just selected a president the year before, and she
was a woman. So they thought, “Oh my gosh, the board is not going to
select two women, one at De Anza and one at Foothill.” So they got
worried about that. Therefore, these faculty were all wondering what’s going

55

to happen.
So then they said, “Oh, it’s probably going to be the black male
because he’s a minority.” And then I remember one faculty member then
says, “Oh, you’re Chinese. You’re a minority, too!” She was so relieved that
it finally occurred to her.
[01:20:05] I thought it was really funny, and actually I thought it was
somewhat flattering because I didn’t come across to her obviously as a
minority first and then whoever I was, second. I can see her face today. She
was just so relieved when she realized that I was a minority as well.
In the process I went through--so these are public interviews now
with the finalists before the whole campus. They have an open forum and
the whole thing. I thought, “Well, I need to be different because they
already know who I am, and if I just talk about all the things that I have
accomplished as vice president, they already know that. I’m not going to
sound very exciting to them.”
[01:20:56] So I did a lot. I remember I took a week off to prepare for
the interview. Oh, I should say--let’s see, when did this happen? I took a
week off and I prepared and I did a lot of reading on higher ed and so forth.
So when I did the reading, somewhere along the line--and frankly I learned
as much, if not more, about leadership from the Business School because
they had all this material on developing a vision and leadership and so on--I
read one book, and it talked about trust, that it was really important in an
organization to instill trust. So I decided instead of talking about my
accomplishments at this open forum, I would talk about values and that

56

these are my values. They were openness, honesty, trust, forgiveness.
[01:21:57] I went through them at the interview--at the forum, and I
told them, “And this is why these are my values.” In the case of trust, I said
that, “I had a personal experience when I was in college where I had a
relationship with someone, and I found out I couldn’t trust him because he
was double-timing me with somebody else.”
This was a personal story I’m telling in front of like two hundred
people. And I said, “But until I met my husband, and then I realized when I
met him that he was the only person that I could trust.” Coincidentally
enough, he and my son walk in the door at the time to this auditorium. I
said, “Oh my gosh, and he’s right here.”
Well, apparently in telling the story, I’m not telling it as well now as I
probably did then because apparently I had tears in the people’s eyes when I
was telling the story, and then for Herbert to walk in, it was almost like we
had planned it, which we hadn’t.
[01:23:03] But it was a totally different kind of forum presentation
than, “I’ve done this. I’ve done that,” and whatever. And I did intend this,
that if I were president that the core values would be the most important
thing to re-instill in the college. One of the reasons for that was because the
college had a financial catastrophe several years before, and so a lot of trust
had eroded between the campus community and the administration. So I
thought it was really important to reinstate trust, and so that was my goal.
That’s what did it.
In fact, to this day, on business cards for Foothill, they have--[sound

57

of filing cabinet being opened and closed]--the core values, which are--here,
I’ll just read them to you. It’s “honesty, integrity, trust, openness, and
forgiveness.”
Asfaha: Wow, from that speech.
Fong: From that speech. But that’s what we used the whole time I was there as
president for twelve years, we talked about trust. But again, I picked it up
from reading something here at Stanford, and it just kind of stuck and
resonated with, again, observing the environment and the landscape and
what does this campus really need? It isn’t somebody who can start a whole
lot of new programs, which of course I’d want to do, but it was more to
revitalize the culture and develop a whole sense of values.
That paid off because there was a point when I was president where
we had to do some major layoffs, both Foothill and De Anza, because of
budget problems. What I wanted to do was close down food service, which
were all staff that we had hired, and then we were going to contract it out.
[01:24:58] Well, in a union environment, you can’t contract out with a third
party very easily. So I advanced basically that what we were going to do is
we were going to promise the five employees that we’ll get them a job
elsewhere in the district. They wouldn’t lose their job. And then we’ll
contract out, which in the long run saved the college money and so on and
so forth.
And so we did, and the union agreed to it and the whole thing. It’s
interesting, because the [staff] union president, after it was all said and done,
he called up and he says, “It just occurred to me that we did this whole

58

thing, and we didn’t even have to sign an MOU [memorandum of
understanding]. This is the ultimate example of trust.”
That was really gratifying to me. That’s what I tell everybody now at
the leadership program and everything else is you have to start with your
values--and trust being a big one, and then of course forgiveness.
Forgiveness is a big one also because leaders make mistakes and so you have
to acknowledge the mistakes, but then people need to forgive because
you’re not always going to be right.
Asfaha: [01:26:06] And so aside from the fact that you read this material from the
Business School here regarding values, you kind of spoke earlier about the
Stanford aura of positivity. Is that something that you feel inspired the type
of culture that you wanted to cultivate at Foothill?
Fong: Oh, yes, absolutely. I’m always a “glass is half full” kind of person. At
Foothill, what I would announce as president, because, especially with the
administrators, everybody would have goals or objectives that they would
have for every year.
[01:26:49] I would tell everybody in the whole college, “I have three
goals. One of them is to instill and maintain trust. The other one was to ‘stir
the pot,’ and then the third one was to foster creativity, so that nobody
would be comfortable. They would be uncomfortable enough to be creative,
but not uncomfortable enough to be frozen in what they had to do.”
And that made a huge difference, even going back to the trust thing,
because one of the values there is openness. You’re not going to be open
with me if I’m your supervisor, if you don’t trust me, because you’re not

59

going to tell me the “truth” because you’re afraid of repercussions. So there
has to be this mutual trusting relationship.
[01:27:44] And people call it now transparency, but it really is really
very important. But you can’t have true transparency unless you really have
trust in the organization. That was a big deal. It is a big deal, and so that’s
really very, very important.
It also helped in communications because then I virtually had no
surprises because I would know pretty much what else was going on
throughout the whole campus, because people were willing to share it with
me or share it with colleagues who would then tell me. So there weren’t any
“secrets” or backdoor deals or whatever it might be.
I think I would put it between my parents, who were always very
positive and proactive, and then Stanford making me feel very empowered,
I guess is probably the best way to put it. Again, I go back to my
“infiltration” theme because I felt that if I could be empowered, then I
could empower others, but I could be doing it from maybe a strategic
position that others may not be able to have. So that’s where I thought I
could be effective.
Asfaha: [01:29:09] And so you were president at Foothill and eventually became
president emerita, right? What brought you back to Stanford? You circled back.
Fong: Well, I retired from Foothill. I had a great time there, but I decided it’s
probably just time to go do something else. But I didn’t have anything in
mind. Actually, I went to the Carnegie Foundation. I was truly retired for
about three years where I wasn’t doing anything. I did a little consulting, but

60

that was it. Then I went to the Carnegie Foundation [Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching] for five years.
[01:29:46] At that time, the president at the time wanted to start a
project focused on community colleges working on math, and that seemed
to be the biggest problem with community college students, not being able
to pass math. He wanted to put best practices from research and pedagogy
and everything else into this and come up with a new way to teach math.
So that’s what we did. It’s still going on today, and it’s been highly
successful. The national success rate for a student in developmental math
getting to and through college-level math is like five percent in three years.
It’s horrible. Five percent in one year, I take that back. Five percent in one
year, but 15 percent in three years.
So when we launched our program, the first year out, and it
continues to this day, which is now over five years, we got a fifty percent
success rate in one year. So we basically tripled the success rate in half the
time.3 But it was just getting the best kind of pedagogy, changing the
curriculum so it was relevant, things that everybody knows how to do, but
usually people don’t do in a concerted effort.
[01:31:05] So I really enjoyed doing that, but I brought, I think, all the
skills I learned by being a president to how do you organize this initiative
and bring people on board and so on. Also I had a lot of friends who were
presidents obviously of other campuses, so I went to them to invite them to
be part of this initiative. Now it’s in fifteen states. It’s got like sixty
Traditionally student success was fifteen percent over a three-year span, and the new work yielded fifty
percent success in one year.
3

61

institutions and so on and so forth.
So I was there very happily, but then our dog died. I had a collie. I’ve
always had a collie. So our collie died, and we got these two new puppies.
They’re both collies, and collies are usually very docile. Well, this one bit
somebody as a puppy. I was mortified, because I had never had a dog bite
somebody.
[01:31:54] So I called up Patti [Gumport], who is the Vice Provost for
Graduate Education, because as a hobby she trains dogs. I asked her to help
me with this puppy who bit somebody, and so she, who has an incredibly
jammed calendar, made an extraordinary amount of time available
afterhours to meet with me and my dog to deal with my dog.
We did this for about six weeks. In the course of that, one, my dog
got cured. She’s very docile now. And then secondly, Patti talked me into
coming to work with her here in this office. So that’s how it happened.
It was just again serendipitous. I have to say everything that I shared
with you, nothing really, had been planned with this long trajectory of, “I’m
going to be this,” and, “I’m going to do that,” and so on and so forth. It was
just serendipitous.
Asfaha: That is wonderful. I guess that’s a good note to end on, too.
Fong: [01:32:52] Sure. Have I answered all your questions?
Asfaha: Yes. Thank you.
