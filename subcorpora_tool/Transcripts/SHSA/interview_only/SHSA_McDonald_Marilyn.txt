Wheelock: So this is Sarah Wheelock and it is October 12th, 2007 and you can
introduce yourself if you like.
McDonald: This is Marilyn Miller McDonald, class of ’57. I’m here for the fiftieth
reunion.
Wheelock: So, you had said you wanted to talk about women’s education on…
McDonald: I did.
Wheelock: Yes.
McDonald: I did, because when I came to Stanford, I was majoring in engineering. And
what brings this to mind is because I ran into someone at this reunion who I met two or
three weeks ago in Palo Alto and I couldn’t remember where I’d met her. And then I
realized, she was a math major and we were one of five women taking calculus at
Stanford. And I had a father who was an engineer and he’d always help me with math
and I was pretty good in math but I wasn’t brilliant in math. But I didn’t have him
anymore to help me when I was at Stanford and I felt more and more that the women in
the classes—I think there were two of us at Branner, and three at Roble -- really didn’t
have any way to get together and study together. Whereas the men, because the vast
number of people in the class were men, had study groups and they studied all the time
together. And we really—the only way I could get in to study with anybody seemed to be
to go on a date—which wasn’t what I had in mind because there wasn’t anybody I

2

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

wanted to date in my particular class. But it was difficult for us to get much support, and
I remember talking to the one woman in Branner who was taking math, but she was
really good at math and she was taking a five-unit course and I was taking a three-unit
course, and she didn’t need any help. So we really couldn’t help each other because we
weren’t in the same class.
And then I was talking to my fellow student just at lunch today and she said, I started out
as a math major, but I couldn’t get a study group together. And she said, I ended up in
psychology or education, but she said, I think I would have done all right if I could have
found somebody to study with. And, surprisingly enough, our instructor was a woman at
that time, and there weren’t many tenured instructors who were women at Stanford at that
time. But there was really no support at all. I don’t know if that’s changed, but I think if
we’d all had a little support, somehow, maybe that—maybe she could have done it—our
instructor—but she didn’t, but we might have stayed in the field. So, I mean I was
struggling; I did okay, I guess: I did pass but it wasn’t the A I was used to getting or even
the B I was used to getting so I thought, well, maybe I’m in the wrong place. There was
nobody majoring in engineering who was a woman—so I would’ve been the only one,
but it was interesting when I went to talk to counselors some of the answers I got, which
was fascinating for me as a woman, like, “Well, most women come here to get married.
So we don’t really know what to do with someone who wants to major in engineering.”
And my mouth would just gape open, so I guess generally there wasn’t much support for
women, at least in the sciences—the hard sciences, although some did manage, but they
were very, very good and probably better than most of the men in the classes. So I think
they did okay. So that was something that was a concern to me.
I eventually found economics and I loved it. I absolutely loved it and they were
supportive to have women in—even though there weren’t very many women in
economics either, but I was really good at it. I really understood it and I absolutely loved
it and went on to become, to get my master’s degree here in economics and I used to
grade papers. I learned how to test that way so I could always get A’s once I figured out
what the instructor was really asking for, and did well in graduate school. And the
3

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

women—it was interesting that the women in economics in graduate school—there were
still probably five of us, but we did form a group. We were a supportive group and we
did come from all over the world. It wasn’t just Stanford. And the women there were
very serious; I remember one from Turkey, oh, she was beautiful young woman but she
was so serious about doing well and being a source of pride for her country at that time.
So we did help each other at that time; we didn’t meet, but most of us were pretty good
too, in our field, so that was okay and I often thought—I’m sure it’s quite different today
for women who are in math and I’m sure there are support groups for them and anyway,
they take calculus in high school, which wasn’t offered to us at that time.
I think we were talking about dress codes, that people got upset about dress codes when
we were here. I don’t know why people did, because in our high schools we couldn’t
wear pants so I don’t think it was any different. I’m sure it was shocking to people today
that you certainly wore pants in the dorm, but you couldn’t go past the post office in your
pants but you know, we couldn’t wear them in high school either unless you went to
women’s college. Now maybe they did at women’s college but I went to a public high
school. My particular high school sent the most—had the greatest number of acceptances
to Stanford in history, forty-two were accepted, South Pasadena San Marino High School.
And I think around thirty came, I don’t think everybody went who were accepted,
because some people went to Harvard, et cetera, but I think—I mean, I was pleased to be
asked.
We had absolutely no money at all. And in those days, my father was an invalid and so
my poor mother was trying to support us, but he’d gone to MIT so he decided his
children could go anywhere they wanted to go, but we had zero money and in those days
scholarships were not based on need at all. Scholarships were based on where you stood
in the class and I probably was number five. I wasn’t number one, so the people who got
the scholarships were often times people who had absolutely no need of them. But I did
come here and I struggled to get a hashing job; they were hard to get, but that would take
care of room and board at that time for us. And by hashing and working very hard in
spare time and I did some interesting work on campus, I remember one with Dr. Festinger
4

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

[Leon Festinger]—he did the theory of dissidence [i.e., theory of cognitive dissonance]
where my whole job was to lie to people and I got very good at it. And people would
come in and ask me how the experiment they were going to do—because all psych
students had to do an experiment. They had to be involved in experiment that some
graduate student was doing. And I was supposed to tell one group that it was wonderful,
one group that it was awful and then one I was supposed to be neutral. And they would
pay the people various amounts of money to do this very boring experiment putting
literally square pegs in round holes. It went on and on and on—it was horrible. And they
did that for two hours. And the theory was if you didn’t pay them and they’d really—if
I’ve got it right, let’s see -- if you paid them ten dollars to do the experiment, then they
would tell the next person, because they had the ten dollars in their pocket, it wouldn’t
create a lot of dissidence [sic] in them, they would tell them how wonderful it was. But if
you didn’t pay them, no I think I’ve got it backwards now. But anyway, the idea was that
I was to lie to them; it had to be someone who was cute because it was all men doing the
experiments and they didn’t—they wanted them to feel bad lying to a cute girl, and I did
that for about three years and only one person ever said, “I don’t believe you.” One
person decided I was probably telling a lie to them, but that was an interesting
experiment.
But I did get through Stanford, and because I’d done so well in economics I went on to
graduate school and was able to get support for graduate school, doing research and so
forth. So, I hope today, life is a lot better for women. I know in class the men did all the
talking, and women rarely got called on. Occasionally somebody thought, well maybe it
was important, but generally I think the instructors felt, well, most of the girls here are
just looking for a husband, which I would hear more than once from them. And so, I
think it’s probably quite different today and women’s education’s come a long way. But I
sent my daughters to Wellesley where women ran everything. And they had wonderful
educations. One of them did come here—I had three daughters, and she did okay here; I
guess, I mean, she did well, she was very bright, but the girls at Wellesley, they ran
everything. They were really active with their alumni groups and I think they’ll probably
send our grandchildren there too. And I think, I had an aunt who was professor at Vassar
5

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

and she wanted me to go to Vassar when I was eighteen and I heard there were no men
there so I said, absolutely not, I was going to go to Stanford. But I’ve often wished I had
done Vassar because I think in that kind of education women get a much better
participation rate, they run things, and they learn skills that we did not have the
opportunity to learn. There were no women presidents then, you were always the
secretary. The young men were the presidents of your class or of the student body, so
there weren’t a lot of opportunities for leadership.
Wheelock: So leadership being the main thing that they get out—or they would’ve
gotten out, you would’ve gotten out of it at the time or that the opportunity to know how
to manage or know how to lead a group?
McDonald: Probably. I ended up being a college administrator so I guess that was
important to me and actually when I left Stanford, I took a test that they offered to see
what you—and that was after I was a graduate student, I believe—no, I think it was after
—it was my senior year, and to see what your skills might be and what—where you
might go to graduate school.
Wheelock: Um hmm.
McDonald: And she said I had gotten the highest mark that correlated with CEO’s in
business, and she said, “You really have to go to business school.” But I was off to
Europe and who knows what at that time. And anyway I wouldn’t have had the money to
go to business school, but I was able to get a master’s in economics. And because they
did finance my way through, so that was good. But I don’t know: when I look back at a
lot of my classmates, some of them did very well, fifty years ago. Some of them are—
did become leaders and very productive, very creative, wrote books, but a lot them—my
female ones, but a lot of them— particularly, I think of this one woman who was so good
in math has never done anything, and you know, when I met her at the fortieth and I said,
“Well what are you doing?” And she said, “Oh, oh well I had three children.” I said,
“But your youngest must be twenty-five by now.” She said, “Well you know, I think”—
6

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

so a lot of them didn’t go forward. And interestingly enough, the ones I thought might
have done something more creative, contribute more to society, didn’t. And the ones that
maybe had a lot of dates, looked a little flighty and all, they sometimes did some very
good things later on, and I guess I’ll hear that today at their—we’re having a talk by them
today, so we’ll see what they do.
Wheelock: Can you hold on a second? My other interviewer is here; let me just tell her
what to do and what’s going on, so I’m just going to pause this real quick.
McDonald: I’m about done.
Wheelock: Are you? I’m sorry, go ahead. I have actually so many questions to ask
you…
McDonald: Oh, okay. I figured you were done.
Wheelock: Let’s just pause and let me ask you another question not related to this …
McDonald: Questions.
Wheelock: That’s right. So, I was going to ask you actually, is there anything that you
feel you got out of that experience of having a hard time? I’ve seen that, often times,
people say, “I wouldn’t recommend that anybody have to learn lessons this way, but in
the long run, I’ve picked up sort of the realities of life by having to go through these sorts
of things.” I was wondering if there’s anything in particular that maybe you thought back
on would actually have…
McDonald: Well, you know I never gave up, it just made me angry. So, I had to work
always very hard for what I got from life. Mainly because of our family situation
because my father, who had, of course, been a bread winner all of a sudden wasn’t, and
we really were in bad financial…
7

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

Wheelock: He got sick?
McDonald: He was ill. He was ill—had serious, serious arthritis at a very young age,
and was bedridden essentially most of his life and died in his forties. But my mother had
to work very hard and she would, you know, not take, she would never take no, because
she had to keep pushing just to keep food for us, because in those days women weren’t
paid very well. She was a secretary, and then, you know, I think I was supporting myself
at a very, very early age. And, of course I lived at home but there was no money to buy
me clothes or anything so I had to work at a young age. And I went to school, South
Pasadena San Marino with people who were extremely wealthy and it was all—it was
very hard, that always bothered me, for a long time. It seemed better at Stanford even
though some people were certainly wealthy at Stanford, but it was more even, I mean,
there not everybody was.
And, so the things I learned particularly, because later on I ended up getting a master in
library science, which I’ve often wondered why so many bright women go into that field
and I figured it out, at least, for our time, that’s one field you could immediately get into
with no glass ceiling and you were immediately a manager even if you had a small
library, even if you—small little junior high, high school library or a little corporate
library, you had to do everything. You had to hire the staff, you had to train everybody,
you had to produce the product, which were your books, you had to deal with the public
and you made the decisions and nobody else was making them over you. So, I also liked
doing that although I ended up being—when I was hired at Foothill College to be their
dean, I’m essentially, the librarian and a few other things. They kept giving me more and
more to do until I ended up getting promoted up to vice-president and I had less and less
time in the library, which was sort of sad to me. But I figured out that’s probably why
women—and I knew a lot of librarians, and they were extremely bright and they did go
into that field because that was one they didn’t hit a glass ceiling. And they would be the
chief CEO. And so, but I remember prop thirteen [Proposition Thirteen] …

8

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

Wheelock: Um hmm
McDonald: …came along and I did lose a job because I was the last hired in the school
district and—let’s see, that was in Palo Alto actually, and they closed the high school and
I was an extra librarian.
Wheelock: Oh, they closed—that was when they closed Cubberley, yeah.
McDonald: And the Cubberley [High School] librarian and took my job because she’d
been there fifteen years and I’d been there three. And that was the rules; that’s how we
got rid of, you know, that it was all done by seniority. But—and that was a hard time for
me, because who was hiring a librarian when there were thousands of them unemployed
and nobody even had jobs anymore for librarians? So, believe it or not, I got a job at the
Stanford Alumni Association as an office manager or assistant office manager; I never
quite got a boss. I will say that was probably the worst job I ever had. And nothing
against the Alumni Association, but I was much too bright for the job I had, and I was just
bored out of my mind, and I was always trying to do more, and they really wanted like an
office assistant to make—you know, get the supplies and type. I was a lousy typist. That
reminds me one of the first jobs I applied to out at Stanford, because they never—I
remembered, trying to get a job with my econ degree and I finally was offered a job at
Dole Chemical, and that was during recession too so things weren’t so good in San
Francisco at that time. And, they said, “And we’ll hire you in the typing pool,” and I
said, “But I’m not a good typist.” And they said, “That’s all right; you can graduate out
of it.” Well, if you’re a lousy typist and they want you to be a typist, you’d never
graduate out of the typing pool, so I didn’t take that job. But, anyway, I did work for a
year at the Alumni Association, and there were some good jobs there, I just didn’t have
one of them. So I finally, I got a job at SRI, because I had met somebody and I gave her
my card and I said, “I have a master’s degree in economics, I’ve been trying to get a job
and I know it’s a bad time to get a job but I also have a master’s degree in library
science,” and she just—one day handed it off to the boss there and I was hired
immediately. And so, at very little money, but I still was hired and I liked being a
9

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

corporate librarian although there wasn’t a lot to go—places to go in SRI—because I was
not the head, and the head of the library wasn’t going anywhere, and the assistant wasn’t
going anywhere so. But I learned a lot about library work at that time, and the next job I
had was dean at Foothill College—dean of the library and at five times my salary.
Wheelock: Excellent.
McDonald: And then I went on from there to be vice-president, and had a lot of things
under me like the foreign campuses and some of them, but very interesting jobs.
Practically working myself to death, but during that time it was interesting because I was
doing some—I was doing a conference—we did a little workshop with the head of the
San Jose State Library who I did admire, and she was new in the job and she said, “And
now I’m going to apply for faculty.” And I said, “Well you just got there. You’ve been
there five years; you’ve automated the library, you’re building a new library.” She said,
“Marilyn, when you’re a manager, they hire you to solve a problem,” and she said,
“you’ve got about five years to solve it. The end of five years, you start to become the
problem.” And I always remembered that and I decided—I remember at Foothill we’d be
waiting around for some of the administrators to leave, and I thought, I don’t want to do
that. So I built a library for them I’d done—just about everything I meant to do, and I—
even though my boss became president and wanted me to do a big job, she wanted me to
do that budget and so forth…
Wheelock: That is Bernadine Chuck…
McDonald: …yeah, Bernadine Chuck Fong, who I love working for. I decided -- I’d
also had cancer…
Wheelock: Oh gosh.
McDonald: …which was scary…

10

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

Wheelock: Yes.
McDonald: …and although I’m fine—I’m a survivor, blah, blah, blah, that was
seventeen years ago, I thought, “You know, I don’t need to keep doing this forever. I
don’t want to be a problem ten years from now, people are waiting for me to leave.” And
so, I actually went back to faculty and became and archivist, which I do today. So at
sixty, I got a new career. I did a lot, you know; I went to a lot of classes and studied and
went to workshops, and I did enjoy that and I’m still doing it because, at this time
anyway, the district—Foothill-De Anza Community College District does not particularly
have the money to hire anybody new, so they hire—they keep a part time person going
who’s enabling them to barely keep the archives going. But it works for me and it seems
to be working for them, but I don’t know how much longer we’ll be doing this together,
but we’ll see. So that’s pretty much what I’ve done. I have had four children in there, and
I did marry a physicist from Stanford, and we did spend ten years here and although we
live here, we don’t spend a lot of time with Stanford because I felt like we were never
going to leave. And to come back and do a lot here, it would be like sort of never
growing up. So …
Wheelock: Yeah.
McDonald: …so we do other things but I love coming to the reunions and surprisingly
even though one’s memory of what happened last week is getting dim, I can remember all
those people, all four hundred of them that came, and so I’m enjoying the reunion a great
deal.
Wheelock: So do you—you said you live here—do you live on campus, or do you live
Palo Alto?
McDonald: No, I live in Palo Alto.
Wheelock: Okay. Okay.
11

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

McDonald: Yeah.
Wheelock: So there’s not quite—you had said staying here would’ve been like not
growing up so it’s…
McDonald: No my husband, after we got out of graduate school—after he got his PhD,
we went to Oxford for a year…
Wheelock: Um hmm.
McDonald: …and studied there, and then he came back and did—and worked for the
Lockheed Research Lab for a while, and then started his own business. And then, even
though I had these four children and loved every minute of it, I was always getting ready
for the next job. That’s when I got my library degree: I’d go to school at night, and I
ended up even getting an MBA at the end of it all.
Wheelock: Really?
McDonald: But, well, you know, I think women of my age and my—or my era, did well
in school, and I even see that in younger women, and they keep going too long probably.
Because they don’t do as well—it’s very hard to do that well in the workforce, at least it
certainly was in the sixties and seventies. So they get a lot of pats on the back because
they’re bright and they can do this, and you know, they’re one of the best in the class…
Wheelock: And they’re good girls…
McDonald: …but yeah, it’s harder to get out and do it in the field. It’s harder just
because you are a woman. I’m sure that women hit that today; they probably still hit that
glass ceiling. But in school they can do very well and of course education offers them
opportunity; librarianship offers them opportunities that they can do well in, and that’s
12

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

probably what why a lot of them go into those fields. And I don’t just mean as teachers,
but as administrators and so forth. Because those are—there are certainly college
presidents who are women and have done very well. But not a whole lot of women are
running Silicon Valley companies, some, but not a lot.
Wheelock: I’m going to jump back a little bit, when you were getting your master’s
degree in econ, were you ever encouraged to go and pursue a PhD?
McDonald: I was, but we were on our way out. We were, you know, I’d married and we
didn’t have any children then, but I was ready to leave Stanford and it would have been
better to have gotten a PhD. but when I did so well on that test against CEO’s in business,
I was really better in business than I was with theoretical economics. And it was
extremely theoretical in those days. It was model building and I would get awfully—I
may build all these models and I’d say, “But what about what happens in the real world?
You know, there is a world out there, and there are people making decisions.” And you
know, they said, “Oh no, we kept all those things stable and—and we just moved this
little thing and then this happened,” but model building, I don’t think is all that prevalent
now in the field of economics, although I’m sure some people still do it. But I would’ve
been better off in business school.
Wheelock: Hmm.
McDonald: And honestly I did not have the money to go to business school. We never
—I never would’ve …
Wheelock: Hm umm.
McDonald: …been able to come together and I don’t know that they even give
scholarships in business school even if you are women—a woman—I doubt that they
give—it’s a professional school, so. And, being the Depression child I was, we just never
would’ve taken loans out, so. I was encouraged to go on for the PhD, but I decided that
13

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

given the way that the department was going at that time, I probably wouldn’t be very
good at it. Certainly not as good as the people they were bringing in from India and
Japan who were just superb model builders and …
Wheelock: They would’ve been great at that experiment, where you had to put the round
pegs in the square, whatever it was.
McDonald: Yeah.
Wheelock: …the two-hour thing you were talking about earlier.
McDonald: So I didn’t go for it, and it was interesting because the professors that were
encouraging me to do that weren’t that way, I mean, they—I worked years with Professor
Moses Abramovitz [ABRAMOVITZ, MOSES, Professor of Economics. A.B., Harvard,
1932; Ph.D., Columbia, 1939. At Stanford since 1948], and he was interested in studying
the long swings in the American economy. And I worked for him for years and am cited
in his book…
Wheelock: Hmm.
McDonald: …and he was actually studying what was going on.
Wheelock: You worked for him as an undergrad as well, and then as a graduate too?
McDonald: I did.
Wheelock: Okay.
McDonald: I did, I did. It was very good.
Wheelock: Was he one of the reasons that you continued on for the master’s?
14

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

McDonald: No, I probably would have always gone for a master’s degree, yeah, I would
have. I think none of the women went on for PhD’s of the women that were there. And
interesting enough, there weren’t a lot of jobs for people with just a master’s degree. I
worked at the Fed for a year in San Francisco, Federal Reserve Bank…
Wheelock: Um hmm.
McDonald: …but you know, they do hire women. They were very good about hiring
women, but of course, not for any of the lead jobs.
Wheelock: Not for anything interesting, huh?
McDonald: Research assistants; that was kind of it. And it was a little boring. And I
never probably really had a mentor, which I think is much more fashionable today to get
one, especially for women, and they help them and I think—I certainly had people
supporting me, but never a mentor. And then after we got married and we went to
England, then we wanted to have children, was getting on in those days, and like most
people of my age, I did have four children. And did like those years, but was always
getting ready for the next phase of my life, which would’ve been a career. So now,
retired that I am and still working, I’m wondering what will happen next.
Wheelock: Maybe business school.
McDonald: I got an MBA at Golden Gate.
Wheelock: They have PhD’s at the business school now and some really fascinating …
But I know—the other thing, I know you have to leave in a few minutes, you wanted to
probably get to the class panel, I’m sure…

15

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

McDonald: I don’t have to be there on time, but we can finish this if you have other
questions.
Wheelock: Well, I have plenty of questions, don’t worry about that. How do you feel
that your experience is like—reflecting back on your, you know, being sort of feeling
discouraged in math and you know, kind of not having a great support network. How do
you think that kind of—if that had an impact at all on your time at Foothill, that played
into that or not—whether you consciously thought about that or…
McDonald: No probably not, because first of all, my boss was always a woman and she
was the smartest one I knew. And she was also a mentor; I said I didn’t have any mentors
here, but I did at Foothill College. And, as a matter of fact, often times, the president at
that time was a man and he’d say, “There’s too many women managers,” but Foothill’s a
very wonderful place to work. You’re encouraged to be at least under my boss,
Bernadine Chuck Fong, she encouraged you to be as entrepreneurial as you wanted to,
and certainly was open to new ideas and supportive of what you did. And so, Foothill
was a good fit for me through the years I was in manage—I loved them all, I don’t think
she ever understood why I didn’t go on when she became president, but I probably, you
know, twelve years as administrator is probably enough and keeps—in the back of my
mind I keep hearing that, librarian—head librarian from San Jose saying, after a while
you become the problem in management. And I thought sometimes this happened—I
think that David Kennedy—David Kennedy the president here in this…?
Wheelock: Donald Kennedy, yeah.
McDonald: Donald Kennedy. He had much said the same thing.
Wheelock: Oh really?
McDonald: When he resigned.

16

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

Wheelock: Um hmm.
McDonald: That he felt he was beginning to become the problem. And I thought he was
a wonderful president. So I didn’t have any opinions one way or the other but I thought
that was interesting that he had said the same—his insights were the same on that, and
thought it was time for him to leave. So, I’ve lost the thread of what you asked me.
Wheelock: Oh, I had just asked whether you felt like any of your experiences have—
that you can kind of played into…
McDonald: It was interesting that the hardest time…
Wheelock: Um hmm.
McDonald: …was trying to get—after Prop Thirteen—a job. And things like New Ways
to Work were coming out, they were trying to help—the work place was trying to help
women. Actually that came out of—that was being supported by our church at that time
-- people were helping you write resumes that, sort of, made you pretend you weren’t
really a librarian, but something else. But, uh…
Wheelock: I think they call that “spin.”
McDonald: That period of time was difficult on my family, because we got down to our
last thousand dollars and we didn’t know what we were going to do. My husband in the
meantime had quit his job, he decided to start his own business, and like any new
business, they tell you it takes three years and it does; you don’t make any money for
three years. So we were in sort of difficult financial situations but it worked out okay in
the end; but my struggles trying to get a job and I really became an expert at that. I used
to teach my students at Foothill how to write a resume, how to use things that they had
done even in a volunteer capacity, to get themselves a job. And they did, and they would
come back and thank me for it. And I have often looked back on my husband, who never
17

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

ever had to even make out a job application as far as I could tell, never wrote a resume.
When the—the Cold War ended and nuclear physics went down, he was just—he was
never one to push. I guess he never had to. So I give myself credit that those times were
hard, but I know that I will never have, worry about getting a job or supporting myself or
anything like that, because I know how to do it. And I think a lot of women know these
skills. A lot of people say, oh yeah, the women can get jobs but the men can’t, and it’s
because they’ve had to learn them.
Wheelock: And early too.
McDonald: And early.
Wheelock: Yeah. When did you start working as a kid? Do you remember how old you
were?
McDonald: I probably do—well certainly, I was babysitting at a young age, because my
mother worked all day long; my father was home, so we did have someone in the house.
Wheelock: Um hmm.
McDonald: But I had to go, it’s a shame, because I had to, you know, we lived in L.A.
and I had to ride the red trolley, and…
Wheelock: Oh, yeah, to the grocery store.
McDonald: I was only eight years old. I mean, can you imagine today the kids can’t
even walk themselves to school, but I was the only one that could do that and, I did have
an older brother, but I—somehow he didn’t.
Wheelock: It’s usually the girl has to do everything.

18

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

McDonald: Yeah, and so I learned how to do that at an early age. So besides
babysitting, I remember sweeping up in front of the store, and then I was very good at
selling things so early on I got jobs working at Bullock’s, which used to be a department
store up here and down there, but I think it’s long gone now, and I used to work in the
summers. That didn’t pay a lot, so I was trying to think of something that would pay
better, and what did pay better was being a lifeguard. So, you know, I was a pretty good
swimmer, so I learned how to do that. But, I always fought to get a summer job, which
were never easy to get, very hard to get and they’re probably hard to get now for
students. But my ability to come back to Stanford depending if I could get a summer job
or not and so, I always managed to no matter what it took …
Wheelock: So the summer jobs were basically paying your tuition and…
McDonald: Yeah, and tuition wasn’t very much then, you know, two hundred and fifty
dollars a quarter. The hashing was my room and board, but it still was hard.
Wheelock: Yeah.
McDonald: It still was hard. I remember my mother said, “I have forty-seven dollars I
can give you,” that wasn’t quite enough. But we didn’t have much money, but I often
think too, when my mother became widowed—and she’d been taking care of my father
for years as a secretary, she went back for her degree at age forty-nine…
Wheelock: Umm.
McDonald: …got a teaching credential, ended up teaching in the public schools, got a
good pension, and was able to support herself to the end, and still leave a little bit for my
brother and I.
Wheelock: Excellent.

19

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

McDonald: But, so I guess I get some of that from her, because when she went back to
school at forty-nine, that would have been in the fifties, not many women did that and
particularly women that have no money. But I guess I learned some of that from her.
Wheelock: The drive.
McDonald: Um-hmm.
Wheelock: Yeah.
McDonald: The drive to succeed.
Wheelock: Um hmm.
McDonald: But it did pay off and I think a lot of women have that.
Wheelock: Um hmm. So it was practical benefit of being female, often times, I think is
a source…
McDonald: I think so too.
Wheelock: ...of practicality in itself, so…
McDonald: Ah, yeah, they’re the ones that end up in the end, making sure the family
gets fed, and there’s a place to live, and they just learn how to do it.
Wheelock: Where were you a hasher?
McDonald: At Lagunita.
Wheelock: Oh, really.
20

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

McDonald: I hashed there.
Wheelock: Umm.
McDonald: Yes. I did, and that meant I could never live in the row houses, because they
couldn’t make money if all the women weren’t paying. So, only men were allowed to
hash in their row houses. I lived in Lag, which at the time, I thought, oh, poor me, but
such a beautiful place that I look back and I think, why did I think poor me? Lag was
beautiful and my roommate hashed too and, uh, I had hoped to see her here, but I called
her a month ago because I did volunteer to call people, and she said she couldn’t. And
then we started catching up, but she was going to be in Hawaii and, I remember when we
were twenty-one, we both decided to smoke because it seemed like such a sophisticated
thing to do. Well, you know, it lasted about a year for me because I kept getting
bronchitis and sick, and I got pneumonia once, so I thought, I’m not going to smoke
anymore, and then I talked to her on the phone and she said, “Oh yeah, I’ve just had lung
cancer and my husband’s had it and it went to my brain,” and she said, “That’s okay,
Stanford took care of me and I’m going to be okay.” And I thought, you know, I’m
never going to see her again; I said, “Ruth, didn’t you stop smoking?” I mean, I thought
everybody stopped smoking. And she said, “No, I never did and neither did my
husband.” And I found out she died two weeks ago. So …
Wheelock: Oh no.
McDonald: …I didn’t get to see her. That you can tape for people…
Wheelock: Yeah.
McDonald: …who ought to have stopped smoking…
Wheelock: Right.
21

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

McDonald: …a long time ago and certainly never started.
Wheelock: Her husband’s not an alum here, is he?
McDonald: I think he is.
Wheelock: Mmm.
McDonald: I think he is because my husband said, yeah he was in—he was my RA, but
he wouldn’t be in a reunion class this year.
Wheelock: Okay. Okay.
McDonald: I don’t think I’ve ever met him because it’s the second husband. I knew her
first husband. But …
Wheelock: Okay.
McDonald: …but I didn’t ever meet him, but I thought that was kind of sad. I just heard
last night, because I thought, well maybe I’ll go see her, you know…
Wheelock: Yes.
McDonald: …after the reunion, but I won’t.
Wheelock: Too bad. Yeah.
McDonald: But she did very well, she majored in psychology and she had a pretty good
job at IBM …

22

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

Wheelock: That’s excellent.
McDonald: …down in San Jose, so she worked hard.
Wheelock: Um hmm. So your time at Lagunita was … that’s where you two were
roommates, right?
McDonald: We were. We roomed together…
Wheelock: She a hasher as well or what?
McDonald: She was.
Wheelock: Okay.
McDonald: She hashed and then…
Wheelock: Did they put you together in a room because you were both hashers? Do you
think?
McDonald: We went to high school together.
Wheelock: Did you?
McDonald: …and didn’t hardly know each other. Well remember we had that big
class…
Wheelock: Right, right, right.
McDonald: …we’re having a mini-reunion of thirty people up here, but we didn’t know
each other very much at high school. She was from San Marino and I was from South
23

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

Pas [Pasadena] and the kids from San Marino went together—school together for eight
years in one school, so when they arrived at our junior high, they really were a close-knit
group. Whereas we had, I think, five or six grammar schools and so, when we went to
junior high we didn’t hardly know anybody. And so anyway they’re hi—the San Marino
group was a close-knit group. The high schools have since separated, I think the year
after we went there. And they’re two separate high schools now. But for some reason
our sophomore year, we didn’t have a way to get to school and so we took the train. And,
you know, we hardly knew each other but our mothers had talked or something, and so
we took the train and we had a really good time, and we were both assigned to Lag and
we found out we were roommates when we got to Lag. And then we became good
friends and stayed together for two years and hashed together, and then we moved to FloMo [Florence Moore Hall] when it opened, and she did inherit a little money and she
said, “The one thing I never want to do is hash again,” so she didn’t. But she had to clean
houses, she still needed money. She didn’t inherit enough so she cleaned houses; she
enjoyed that better, I guess, she was very neat. But we didn’t really keep in touch over
the years. I don’t know why, but our paths sort of diverged and we just didn’t. But I’d
hoped we could have picked it up. But we won’t now. So, but you know, she was always
going to do something with her life and she did.
Wheelock: Did you feel the same way about hashing that she did—even though I know
that you had to keep doing it, right? Were you a little more positive about it?
McDonald: I liked hashing…
Wheelock: Oh, good.
McDonald: I liked the people that I hashed. I met some great people, and it was such an
easy way to make money. And you made—if you figured out the hourly pay you did very
well hashing, better than anywhere you could, and I felt really lucky to have the job.
Occasionally, just occasionally, I remember some of my fellow classmates would start

24

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

treating us like, you know, waitresses and I thought that was a little odd, but that wasn’t
most of them.
Wheelock: Okay.
McDonald: And there were some really great people that hashed, great women, great
men that became leaders and did well in life, so, they worked hard.
Wheelock: They should have a hashing mini-reunion.
McDonald: They should have, and I’ve thought about having a hashing mini-reunion
but I remember it’s hard to do it by the class…
Wheelock: Um hmm.
McDonald: …because probably in my class three of the twenty-five hashers would’ve
been in my class. They were all over the place.
Wheelock: Oh yes.
McDonald: And we’d be hashing in all kinds of dorms.
Wheelock: Umm.
McDonald: …but at Lag, maybe only three of them would’ve been there.
Wheelock: Okay.
McDonald: So, we probably couldn’t have had many people from the class of ’57 who
hashed at Lag—they could have hashed other places but then I wouldn’t have known
them very well, so that’s the way it went.
25

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

Wheelock: Well since it seems like the people that were hashers, then ended up doing
well because you have to…
McDonald: You had to work.
Wheelock: You had to know how to work. I mean, you can’t graduate and be working
at the same time without knowing how to work and knowing how to study, and when you
have to do that, you have to do that. You know?
McDonald: And manage your time.
Wheelock: And manage your time, so I think that that’s one of the, you know, maybe
not the—like I said earlier, maybe it’s one of those things that you kind of wish didn’t
have to learn it that way, you know, kind of wish you didn’t have to…
McDonald: But I never…
Wheelock: …you just don’t have an option, so…
McDonald: I never had it any other way.
Wheelock: Right.
McDonald: I was happy to have a job. Now, when we sent our children to college they
didn’t have to work, but I made them work in the summer. I thought work was very good
and they started working for Stanford, catering, at age thirteen or fourteen; somehow they
were able to do that and they worked every summer. And other people said, “Well why
didn’t you send them here, or to there?” and I said, “You know, it’s good for them to
work.” And I still think so. And they’ve done pretty well.

26

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

Wheelock: Excellent. I think I’m going to have to stop now because I know you need to
get to the…
McDonald: Okay.
Wheelock: …class panel. But thank you so much for coming and all—you know…
McDonald: Well, you know…
Wheelock: Hijacking you at lunch, when I just brought you over here and this stuff here,
I’ve got to get you some …
McDonald: Oh, I got to sign this; yeah, well I appreciate it and if I hadn’t sat next to that
girl—woman at lunch and remembered what it was like and we both said, “If we just had
a support group.” We just said it at this lunchtime.
Wheelock: Yeah.
McDonald: I thought, now that’s what I could talk about. The one thing that I want to
say about Dianne…
Wheelock: Oh, right.
Mcdonald: …well you don’t have to put this on…
Wheelock: Okay. Do you want me to stop the tape or?
McDonald: Well I can say this if you like. She was my—our RAs, we had a great RA,
I can’t remember her name, Connie something, in our freshman quarter and Dianne
Feinstein was her best friend and of course that—she would have been a year or two
older than u—two years I think, and I remember meeting her on occasion because she’d
27

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/MARILYN MCDONALD

come see her friend. And she would look you right in the eye with those gorgeous blue
eyes, and you became the most important person in that room; I mean, she was just
introduced to me, but she would just capture you completely, and you knew that she
really cared about what came out of your mouth; and I’m so proud of her because, you
know, she used that, and she is a very sincere person, and she’s done very well.
Wheelock: Excellent.
