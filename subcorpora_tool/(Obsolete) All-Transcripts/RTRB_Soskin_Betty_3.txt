ARBONA: So this is now tape number three, on June 25, 2010. And I&#039;m here with
Betty Reid Soskin. This is Javier Arbona. You&#039;ve told us that you blocked out
Port Chicago for a while. But you went back to it. And in your previous oral
history, you talk about going back during--I suppose it&#039;s the sixties?

SOSKIN: Yeah.

ARBONA: Can you talk about what brought you back there?

SOSKIN: I don&#039;t remember how I came about it. Probably it was related to
bringing up children. My mentor during those early activist years was a
Unitarian minister named Aron Gilmartin, who was--

STEIN: How do you spell that?

SOSKIN: G-I-L-M-A-R-T-I-N, A-R-O-N was Aron. I can figure out that he was an
active Socialist. He must&#039;ve been. People have told me that I&#039;m a Marxist. I
have never understood even what a Marxist is, except that whatever it is, Gil
has [laughs] claims on my conversion. But he was also a close friend of Norman
Cousins. His credentials, in terms of activism--he was a member of Ethical
Culture before coming here. He was an uncompromising liberal progressive. And I
don&#039;t know whether I learned from him in words or by inference, that a belief
was not valid unless acted upon; that that&#039;s how one activates a belief. And in
trying to pass that on to my children, whenever a social problem out there
occurred--and this was probably during the sixties and maybe before that,
even--and I think now that maybe it was already embedded in my psyche, because
of the fact that I was able to deal with those people in Pleasant Hill head on;
that it must&#039;ve been there anyway.

But it led me into a series of political acts that involved standing with others
on the roadway to Port Chicago, in a protest, twice. The first time, I flunked
activism. [laughs] The first time, I went out there on my own. And this was
because I wanted--by now, I knew that my son Bob had become politically active
because we&#039;d run into each other at the Oakland Induction Center. [they laugh]
He had cut school. And I was being driven, in part, by Bobby&#039;s political
activism as much as my own, because I needed to prove myself. So that I was sort
of out of my generation, acting out in Bob&#039;s generation. Because this was
Vietnam protests, right? So that Bob was turning up in lots and lots of places.
And he didn&#039;t turn up at Port Chicago. But I knew that there was an action going
by Quakers. So I drove out there. Maybe so I could tell Bob. [laughs] But there
were maybe a dozen people that I didn&#039;t know standing along the roadside. Not
interfering, but challenging the trucks as they went by, by their presence.

And while I was there, a young African-American teenager turned up. None of
these people were speaking, so they may have all been strangers to one another.
Maybe all motivated by the same thing I was. I didn&#039;t know anybody there, and I
didn&#039;t hear any conversations. But it was a vigil. We were clearly individuals
who were acting on principle. And this kid, who was obviously very much younger
than the rest of us, took his place separate and apart from the others. Maybe
because he was from Pittsburgh; I don&#039;t know where he was. But maybe because we
were all grownups. Maybe it was just that. But he, I recall distinctly, standing
back about maybe six feet over and three feet back from the rest of the line.
And I was at the other end of the line. And trucks began to come by. No, cars
began to come by. This was a Sunday afternoon. And cars began to come by. And
there would be families of them, whole families, holding up their middle fingers
at those of us standing on the--. And I remember wondering how people could do
that, with children. And they would scream out obscenities. And here were all
these people going by. And I was struggling. I remember that being my first
action, I think against Vietnam or supporting the peace action or whatever it
was, and wondering how people could do that with their families. This was a
family outing, obviously. And they were going by screaming insults at us. And I
couldn&#039;t escape the notion that something I was doing was causing that.

It was really, really a struggle for me to stay there, because I felt like I was
making those people do that. And it may have been, also the fact that I was
coming out of--either going into or coming out of--a real mental break. But I
can remember those feelings. And finally a truck coming by--the trucks would
travel as close as they could to us without striking us. And those people that I
was standing with would not give an inch. And I was falling back each time. And
I can remember the trauma even now, of not knowing what a war was like;
realizing I&#039;d never been in a war and I didn&#039;t know what war was, but I knew
what a truck was and I was afraid of those trucks. And at one point, when I
stood back and I saw this kid, who had never been in the frontline, but standing
back, he was fingering a knife. And I knew these were Quakers that I was with
that were defying this thing, this drama that was happening in front, and that
they didn&#039;t know that he was armed. And I knew that that kid could have--that we
were all on the same side.

But how these fit together, how those families driving by with their obscenities
and those servicemen who were going by in their trucks and these Quakers who
were standing there on the road, how it all fit together became overwhelming,
and I ran. I was in tears. I got into my car, and I drove to my church, and I
told Aron Gilmartin that I flunked, [they laugh] that I had absolutely failed.
And he said, &quot;Only for the moment, Betty. You will go back.&quot; And he was that
kind of person. And I did go back. But I went back and it was years later. I
don&#039;t even remember.

But it was also at Port Chicago that I returned to, the day after a Unitarian
man had had his legs severed by a train. And I went back there as more of a
mature adult, having lived a lot of episodes in my life; having more of a
conviction about the war, about all wars; of being more sure of myself; of being
older; of being confronted and going through realities that I did not think I
could have survived. And that day, I was able to stand with--there weren&#039;t that
many of us; there may have been three or four. But all standing. Now I knew that
I was standing there, right?, but I don&#039;t know whether his name was Brian. Is it?

ARBONA: I assume you&#039;re referring to Brian Willson.

SOSKIN: Yes. Never knew him before or since. I since did see him at the Berkeley
Unitarian Fellowship some years later. But I didn&#039;t know him at the time. But
isn&#039;t it funny? His name came to me just before you said it. And he&#039;s not
someone I knew.

ARBONA: It&#039;s yeah, Brian.

SOSKIN: That is wild.

ARBONA: Yeah. Willson, with two L&#039;s, W-I-L-L-S-O-N.SOSKIN: That is wild. How&#039;d
that come up for me? But that&#039;s when I really had it worked out, and I was able
to stand my ground. For him. And because of rightness and the position of
anti-war. And that shuts the book on Port Chicago for me. Until I became a park
ranger. And that all began to open up. And by now, the war has ended, the
Vietnam war&#039;s over and we&#039;d confronted a lot of stuff. And now that&#039;s been made
a national park.

ARBONA: Going back a little bit to this Willson episode, did you find out--this
is in 1987.

SOSKIN: That when it was?

ARBONA: Yeah.

SOSKIN: Yeah, well, I told you it was years later.

ARBONA: And this is during the Central American--well, this Iran-Contra, around
that time. Reagan&#039;s in the White House.

SOSKIN: Isn&#039;t that bizarre? So, yeah. So a lot had gone down since that initial
Port Chicago experience. It wasn&#039;t just Vietnam, it was Nixon, it was the
whole--. Oh, and meanwhile--I don&#039;t know whether before or since--I was invited
to be an artist in residence at a meeting of the SDS students at Colorado
Springs. This was after Kent State. And they had gone there to protest Nixon&#039;s
speech at the US Air Force Academy. I don&#039;t remember the year. I was invited as
one--. [laughs] That&#039;s another time. Bob, who was living in Big Sur, turned up
at the conference and his mother was there. [laughs] Oh, my God. But I was one
of only six adults that they had chosen to join them for a week at Colorado
Springs. One was Ric Masten, poet from Big Sur. I think Rennie Gaines, who was a
part of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross&#039;s operation. He since has acquired an African
name, which I don&#039;t remember anymore. I think it was David Rendl-hast, of
Ontario. I don&#039;t remember any of the others. But anyway, there was that week
period at Colorado Springs. And I don&#039;t know whether that was before--I imagine
that that was since, that Nixon would not have--

ARBONA: No, it would&#039;ve been before.

SOSKIN: It would&#039;ve been Reagan that would&#039;ve been--when Brian Willson&#039;s thing, right?

ARBONA: &#039;87, yes.

SOSKIN: Okay, then this was under Nixon, because Nixon--they were protesting the
speech at the Air Force Academy. So that that had to be even later.ARBONA: And
they went to Port Chicago to protest.

SOSKIN: Who?

ARBONA: The six you mentioned during that Nixon speech, [inaudible].

SOSKIN: [over Arbona] No, no, no, this was in Colorado Springs. They had invited
me to their--it was a national conference, a continental conference. There were
kids from all over the country. And some of them had been at Kent State. So that
was after Kent State. It was the same year. But I seem to have been in all of
these iconic situations all along the line. By no design. And almost, except for
Bobby, alone. [they laugh] Don&#039;t know how Bob feels about that.

ARBONA: Now, why did you go back in &#039;87?

SOSKIN: Go back?

ARBONA: To Port Chicago.

SOSKIN: Because of Brian. I read about it in the paper. And it may have been
that I knew that he was a Unitarian, so I might have heard it from inside the
Unitarian community. Maybe he was a speaker at some Unitarian event later on. I
don&#039;t know whether he--my guess is that he was either a Unitarian or a fellow
traveler with us. [laughs] A lot of my activism was coming out of the fact that
I was in a community of activists in the Unitarian denomination.

ARBONA: And then the memorial happens.

SOSKIN: Yeah. Then the memorial happens.

ARBONA: Later on.

SOSKIN: And that day of remembrance brought--and all of those seemed to be
singularly iconic. All of those things, even though years apart, lead to the
same thing, same reality. The rightness of my being involved there as a park
ranger. There&#039;s some kind of authenticity about that. I tend to think of it only
as minimally involved in Port Chicago, and based in that party. But I hadn&#039;t
remembered these other events until now. So that there&#039;s not been that one
connection to Port Chicago, there&#039;s been several.

ARBONA: Several.

SOSKIN: And mostly pretty traumatic.

ARBONA: Yeah, I can&#039;t really figure out a way of asking this question, but it&#039;s
just fascinating how the site brings together so many different threads.

SOSKIN: Oh, yeah. Sure.

ARBONA: And that you&#039;ve participated in those. Those threads have also been a
part of your life.

SOSKIN: Yeah. And I don&#039;t know what the answer to that is. Some of those threads
I hadn&#039;t connected until now, in the telling. Because they&#039;ve not been evoked by
anything. There&#039;s been no way to connect them. I have done the day of
remembrance on my blog. And even now, they&#039;re unfolding. As I was saying, I
guess on the day of the tour, that it wasn&#039;t until I was speaking at the US
Customs House in San Francisco that I looked at that DVD that I put together
that incorporates that Joseph photo of the caskets, and suddenly saw the missing
flags. So that&#039;s still unfolding. That story is still unfolding for me. And my
suspicion is that some researcher is going to feed into that narrative at some
point, using that photograph as proof that those people could not have gotten a
fair trial.

ARBONA: Why don&#039;t you tell us a little bit about that photo?

SOSKIN: That photo, there&#039;s an E.F. Joseph photo. And we maybe need to get some
background. E.F. Joseph was an African American, was actually from the island of
Santa Lucia. He was from a Caribbean island. And he settled in the Bay Area in
the twenties, and took everything related to African Americans, all social
activities and political activities, until the mid-seventies, when he died.
Among those photographs is one taken at Port Chicago--no, taken at Port Chicago,
but taken after the explosion--of a portion of the twenty-two caskets in which
the remains of African-American--. Now, how they told African Americans from any
others, I don&#039;t know, because they were all fragments of bodies. But they were
buried in twenty-two caskets, in the colored section of Golden Gate National
Cemetery in San Francisco.

There is an African American [inaudible]. Now, that comes out of the fact that
blacks and whites were traditionally separated, even after death, and that the
national cemeteries also were--gathered in the photograph are people who I
recognize as being African American union officials from Boilermakers Auxiliary
36, that I worked for. So that those men--Mahlon Roles, who was the
secretary-treasurer of that auxiliary, Boilermakers A-36; Spencer Jordan, who
was his assistant; Reverend Smith, who was the uncle of Mahlon Roles--are the
three African Americans. They are standing with other Boilermaker Union
Auxiliary members or officials and some Kaiser Permanente people. Now, because
I&#039;m of that era, I recognize those people. So I knew what that is. And there are
a portion of the twenty-two caskets.

I went online after this revelation of these caskets being missing their flags,
and looked at the inscription that&#039;s at Golden Gate cemetery site, and saw that
in the graphic on the website, it talks about the general who&#039;s buried there,
the other people who were buried there at Golden Gate Fields; now, it&#039;s not the
colored section. And it mentions, give a couple sentences to the Italian
American, German prisoners of war who died in captivity, who were also buried
there. And then, as an afterthought, also buried in this cemetery, in the
colored section, are the twenty-two caskets of--and it says twenty-two, I
think--buried as unknowns in the cemetery, without mentioning that there were
320 or whatever it was who died, without mentioning an explosion, without
mentioning that they&#039;re even sailors. The only reason we know that is because
they were court-martialed, which meant that they were servicemen. But in this,
it says African Americans. They could&#039;ve been stevedores. Right? It doesn&#039;t
mention that there was an explosion.

And I suddenly began to see what was missing in the inscription on the website.
And when I&#039;m watching from the dark, the presentation of this thing which I&#039;ve
created and which I&#039;ve been through so many times, and suddenly thought, there
are not flags over those caskets, and began to wonder why. And where are the
remains of the white servicemen who died, also? Civilians or maritime or
whoever, sailors. There were 196 of those or whatever it was. Are they also
here? And are there photographs? And were those caskets flag draped? So those
questions, even after all these years, began to haunt me, much as Richert haunts
me at this site. That there are undisclosed facts about Port Chicago that I
connect to, and I don&#039;t know why. And that story is incomplete, and probably
will be even when I die. But maybe some of them are embedded in my memory; I
don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know how it would figure.

But since those attitudes that prevailed at the time would not have allowed them
to be identified as sailors, who would not have been honored with flag-draped
caskets, that may suggest the fact that those remaining survivors should be
exonerated, because they could not have received a fair trial. And maybe that
photograph is proof of that, that it indicates the attitude that prevailed in
those years. And I think it&#039;s an important question for somebody to research,
because we need photographs of the white people who survived--I mean who were
lost, and to see how they compare.

ARBONA: Wow, there&#039;s so much to unpack.

SOSKIN: Yeah, but those are stories that are untold, and they really are
fascinating. And we really need some graduate students to start delving into
some of that stuff.

ARBONA: I think I have one other question that&#039;s somewhat--I don&#039;t mean to
deviate from that last thought--

SOSKIN: No, fine.

ARBONA: --but I guess that I was interested in hearing about how you&#039;ve gone
back to the site now these last few years. And I was wondering if you&#039;ve met
George Miller, for example.

SOSKIN: Oh, yes.

ARBONA: And maybe to ask you to reflect on his work, and perhaps there&#039;s other
people that you&#039;d like to mention that also come to mind, with him.

SOSKIN: Yeah. As I said, and it really wasn&#039;t just in passing, I&#039;ve become more
aware. Or at least it&#039;s been confirmed for me in these later years, maybe in the
past decade, mainly, that there have always been people trying to get it right.
George Miller&#039;s one of those. Dion Aroner is another of those. They&#039;ve been in
and out of government and they&#039;ve been in and out of power positions. But they
date back as far as the fact that there was a ship built in the Richmond
shipyards by Henry Kaiser that was named for Toussaint L&#039;Ouverture. Would you
not like to see a copy of the transcripts of the discussions that went into how
that was arrived at? We&#039;re still fighting the Haitian revolution. I mean, literally.

And that is an example of people trying to get it right. I think that there have
always been those. I think that our current President is trying to get it right.
Whether or not he dominates is whether or not the supports that he needs to be
there; whether or not people like me--. And I really think it&#039;s my job. [laughs]
I really think it&#039;s my job. And I don&#039;t know when I came to that. But it&#039;s my
job to create pressure on the people with the power; that I may not prevail, but
that I am leaning in the direction of positive social change, with unseen
others. And it&#039;s my faith in those unseen others that are out there trying to
get it right that keeps me strong. It really, really does. If there&#039;s any faith
in this, it&#039;s in that, that there are those people. And I may not be aware of
who they are, but they&#039;ve always existed. And someday there&#039;s going to be a
critical mass of us. [laughs] And it waxes and wanes; sometimes we&#039;re in and out
of power. But the &quot;we&quot; of me is always out there. And that if I don&#039;t do it,
it&#039;s not going to be done, because my voice is needed. And I may not ever be
able to see where those supports are, who they are. I may not recognize them,
but they&#039;re there. And I do really, really, really feel empowered.

ARBONA: In what way would you like to see that Port Chicago chapter developed?

SOSKIN: I think it&#039;s still going to be true that what gets remembered is
dependent upon those doing the remembering. I think that we&#039;re in danger, or
have been in danger, of having that commemoration based upon the loss--the
generations who have succeeded those of the experience being those who are
remembering. So the explosion at Port Chicago and the destruction of the town of
Port Chicago will move to the forefront--. Unless we can revive the history of
those men and what they went through, using the trials of exoneration, which
should sometime come up because there are people interested in seeing that those
come, because those will expose the stories of those boys who were lost. And
because of their unintended gift to us, which was that was the trigger that
caused President Truman to desegregate the armed forces; that the role that they
played, even by being destroyed, fed into the desegregation of the armed forces,
which subsequently led into the entire dismantling of the system of--. And we
wax and wane; we go back and forth. Right now we&#039;ve got some regression.

But Port Chicago plays a pivotal role in that. I think it triggered the modern
Civil Rights Movement, that I think began with the response to Port Chicago,
because that&#039;s where African Americans said, we will not be backed up any
further than this. That&#039;s where people began to not accept the status quo. Also
that by happenstance, the city of Berkeley began to change visibly. And this is
something I experienced. I remember when Mr. DeBonis, Charles DeBonis, the
ultraconservative of Berkeley, who was on the city council--. And that Berkeley
could have been described as being like any other Midwestern town, as
conservative; but that because this was the place that was on the edge of
everything--that we were on the edge of the Pacific, we were on the edge of
scientific change; we were the birth of the atom bomb, we&#039;re the birthplace of
the United Nations--. This is where everything happened, from the World War--the
beginning of that war until its end and until the twenty years that followed
that; that we became that cauldron. But people began to converge on Berkeley
because it was believed to be the change agent, the liberal capital of the
world. And they made it so, by a self-fulfilling prophecy. They came in such
large numbers that they made it what they believed it already was. And I watched
that transformation. It was one of the most exciting things I think I&#039;ve ever
seen. And even in the happening of it, I seemed to be aware that it was
happening. I was recording it. I have papers in my files, where I was
standing--I was standing in the crowd when S.I. Hayakawa was, with his bullhorn,
on top of San Francisco State, with people who were protesting.

All of those things I was watching happen close up. And I watched--and that&#039;s
what this article was about--I watched the greater Bay Area become the catalyst
for a change which is still occurring. We began to lead the nation and the world
in social change. It radiated out from this nexus. And still does. UC Berkeley
is, of course, not nearly as progressive as it was during those years, and
there&#039;s been that kind of regression, but we&#039;ve never dropped back as far. And
we&#039;ll always have those pulsations. But it&#039;s amazing. And my life has paralleled that.

ARBONA: And so your hunch is that also Port Chicago had a big part of that.

SOSKIN: It was the catalyst. It&#039;s my belief that Port Chicago really did
trigger, by making visible those things which, up until then, had been accepted.
Eleanor Roosevelt was doing her thing, in terms of social change, even before
her husband was; but he was sort of going along as far as he could, without
changing anything, really. The GI Bill, as I say, was not effective. The changes
put into employment practices were never enforced. A. Philip Randolph&#039;s
confrontation with Roosevelt did not yield very much. They were in name only.
But Port Chicago, it really did become the catalyst. This was the game changer.
I think that we&#039;re going to find, when the academics take it on, when you take
it on, that a lot of what happens consequently came out of Port Chicago. It
really did. And I&#039;m just convinced that those men&#039;s lives were not wasted; that
they were sacrificed, but that they were not wasted; that they did really,
really trumpet--they dictated the next twenty years of social change. We were
being asked before then, as African Americans, to fight, to work, and even die
for social changes which we would not enjoy for another twenty years. And many
were doing that. Many were doing that. That&#039;s amazing, when you really think
about what African Americans withstood over the following twenty years. And I am
convinced. That is what Port Chicago means to me.

ARBONA: So I could keep asking questions all day, but I worry that it&#039;s been
already a long morning.

SOSKIN: I really don&#039;t even have any idea what time it is. [they laugh]

STEIN: Pause for a minute?

ARBONA: Yeah, we could pause.
