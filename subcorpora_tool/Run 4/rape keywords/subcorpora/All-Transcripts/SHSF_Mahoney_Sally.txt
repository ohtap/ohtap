 Tracy: This is Allison Tracy. It is January 28, 2014. Iâm here with Sally Mahoney to conduct our first session of the interviews for the Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program. Sally, to start out, can you tell me a little bit about where you were born and where you grew up? Mahoney: [00:00:17] I was born and raised in San Francisco in the Upper Market-Twin Peaks area of the city. I am one of three siblings, so we were a family of five. My parents met in San Francisco, and each of them had come quite independent of one another from Ireland, so they were immigrants. My father came as the fourth of his brothers to leave home and came to San Francisco about the time of the Irish Civil War after independence. He left his oldest brother to inherit the land at home because Ireland has primogeniture, and has it, I think, still. He was sponsored by his relatives of some sort and came. He had learned plastering as a young man, and that was 13 the work he did, becoming a foreman for a general contractor in San Francisco. My mother had come at the age of twelve, in the company of another twelve-year-old, by boat and train to San Francisco. Someone met them at the boat and took them to the train. Iâm not at all sure of that. Neither of my parents went through Ellis Island, and the reason was that they had second class tickets, and so they could get off at the dock that other people got off at, something I learned only just a few years ago. After the Second World War, the building industry changed and general contractors began to work with subcontractors, so my father started a small business and probably had at any one time himself and maybe two other plasterers and a hod carrier, and sometimes if there was a lot of work-as there certainly was in the late forties--he would have larger crews. We, on Sundays, visited the houses he had been working on, and it was a kind of march to the ocean. San Francisco, and the Sunset [district], was really sand dunes, and block after block those neighborhoods were built. My mother, as I said, came as a twelve-year-old. She went to high school in San Francisco, did various things after high school, and met my father around 1933 or thereabouts. They married, bought a house in 1937, the home we all grew up in. My mother was a stay-at-home mom. Tracy: Were you the oldest or the youngest or the middle? Mahoney: [00:04:00] I was the oldest. I have a younger sister, now deceased, and a brother who was eight years younger than me, so I really never knew him 14 until he was an adult, because when youâre, for example, a high school freshman, your eight-year-younger brother isnât very interesting. I was always a good student in school, and my parents didnât put pressure on me about education, but they also said it was important. I attended a parish parochial school, Most Holy Redeemer, which was in what is now the Eureka Valley-Castro area, K through 8âactually 1 through 8. I didnât go to Kindergarten. The school I attended was very very crowded. My first grade was fifty-two youngsters, one teacher, and we did fine. About three months ago, I went to the sixtieth reunion of my class, and we all turned out all right. Because I did well in the school, I had various little tasks. The principal would appear at the door and ask me to take messages around to other parts of the school. Initially, I was quite shy and I would come back and say there was no one there, and she would take me by the hand and walk me up to the classroom, which was usually the eighth-grade classroom, and they were big and so I was scared. She would say, âI think they might be here,â and she would open the door and she would push me in, and I would deliver this message and come out. I got over that very quickly. I went to a Catholic girlsâ high school, Immaculate Conception Academy at 24th and Guerrero. At the time I went to high school, there were thirteen Catholic girlsâ schools in San Francisco. There are now three. I am, even as we speak, trustee of the school where I was also a student. Everyone there expected that I would go to college. Tracy: Was that a common expectation for students? 15 Mahoney: [00:06:52] No. My graduating class of seventy-three students had four students who went to college. Most of them went and took exams to work either for the city or the county or the fed, and spent, in some cases, their whole lives, and in other cases simply until they married and started families, in civil service kinds of work, mostly clerical. But the four of us who went to college all did very well. I went to the San Francisco College for Women. Its corporation dissolved in the 1970s. It had become coed and kind of unfocused and didnât last the late sixties, early seventies. So the Jesuits at University of San Francisco bought the property. It was not a merger, but it was the purchase of property. But I went there. I thought about other schools in the area, but places like Santa Clara or USF were not options. They were menâs institutions at the time. I knew about Stanford and I knew about Berkeley. My parents didnât want me at Berkeley. It was too large and too public and too much of many things. And I didnât know anybody serious who went to Stanford. Tracy: At that time. Mahoney: [00:08:41] At that time. Now, that would have been 1957. I knew smart people who liked to party, but I didnât know any serious people. Somehow I thought if I was going to go to college, I needed to be serious. [Tracy laughs.] I went through a humanities honors program at the San Francisco College for Women, which is not unlike the humanities special programs that Stanford has had for years, kind of Great Books program over four years, regardless of what your major was. I majored in English, had always thought I would teach, and then in my senior year, several of the faculty suggested 16 that I think about applying for a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, and I did that and received it, and received it to use at Stanford. So thatâs how I got to Stanford. Tracy: Sort of a repetitive question, as you were finishing up your undergraduate work, was it typical, were they encouraging many other women to look into graduate school, or was thatâ Mahoney: [00:09:57] To education, to humanities, but not yet to law or business. Now, I have several classmates who became doctors. By âseveral,â I mean three or four. So somehow in that four-year periodâand also the religious at Sacred Heart, who owned and sponsored the college at the time, were serious intellectual women, and are still. They were largely West Coast women, had degrees from Stanford, from UCLA, from UC, and so were encouraging. They were interesting, they were lively, and I enjoyed my undergraduate career. I did the student newspaper, which I edited, and I had a work-study job, which turned out to be very useful over a long period of time. The vice president for external relations, who also put out an alumnae newsletter and did those kinds of things and did a little bit of fundraising, needed a workstudy student to help edit the alumnae newsletter, and that was my job for four years, and I got quite good at it after four years. But it connected me to a variety of people and it taught me what people did. Many of the women that I interviewed for stories or followed up with for one thing or anotherâthe college was about 60 percent day students, 40 percent boarding students, and the boarders were from all overâand 17 because we were always interested in the newsletter in highlighting women who were doing interesting things, I got to know a lot of women who did interesting things. A judge, a woman who, I guess, when I interviewed her was a lawyer, but in the Second World War she had been the first of the women in the air force. They flew supply airplanes. I interviewed her and asked if she had any questions for me, and she told me what she thought I ought to do with my life. So those experiences were very influential and they were probably unusual, but because they were my bread and butter, I didnât think of them as particularly unusual. Stanford was a convenient place, it was close, it was good, and so I came to Stanford. Tracy: At that point, in the early sixties, does it shed somewhat this country club reputation? Mahoney: [00:13:55] No. I didnât know many undergraduates, but my colleague graduate students had a dim view of Stanford undergraduates, and, of course, because it was the English department, many of them taught freshman writing, and that was where they got their dim view. Everybody agreed Stanford students were bright, and people also agreed that not all of them were rich. There was a mistake out there that these were rich kids, but I think all my graduate student colleagues knew a lot of undergraduates who were not well off, and so that didnât figure. The faculty was changing when I came. Terman [Fred Terman] and Sterling had been building the faculty, first in science and engineering and then in the humanities a department at a time, and history and English were 18 early on. When I cameâand I didnât realize it until much laterâProfessor Albert Guerard was there. Now there are some people who would remember his father, and he held the chair with his fatherâs name, but he had just been recruited from Harvard, and he brought with him a younger faculty member, Tom Moser-and Ron Rebholz was new, all sorts of people, and the department was building. It had had some really fine people. A Shakespeare scholar who was fine, [Virgil Whittaker]. Yvor Winters, and his wife, Janet Lewis, were really fine scholars, very opinionated, and probably the newer people would take the department in a different direction, but they recognized and went after quality. History, the same thing. I lived with four other women in what we called Richard Grossâs Gross House. It was in Los Altos, and it had a septic system that was always broken. He had gone to Swansea, Wales, on sabbatical, so we had the house free for a year. I was the correspondent with him. That was my piece of theâ Tracy: Your contribution. Mahoney: [00:17:13] Contribution to the whole. And I had to tell him that we would have plumbers in and that we had the bad news that his septic system was going to have to be replaced. So thatâs how we referred to the place, Richard Grossâs Gross House. The next year, I lived with a graduate student who was finishing a dissertation on William Faulkner and who then went to the City College of New York in a tenure-ladder position, but left there and went to San Diego State, where she was for forty years before her retirement. 19 Then the second year, I went into the SEP program, the Secondary Education Program. I did summer and then I taught full-time, and I came back the next summer. I taught at MA (Menlo-Atherton), and it taught me that I did not want to teach secondary school, even though any number of my parents and their friends thought it would be a good thing for me to have a credential. Well, I got a credential, but I certainly didnât want that environment. And I didnât want it not because I didnât like the students. I loved them. I didnât like the teachersâ lounge. They were unhappy, and I thought, âI donât want to work with unhappy people,â because I came to find out from other people in the program that that was a common experience. So I came back to the department and started again, worked with George Sensabaugh on some seventeenth-century materials, and that year to fund myself in part, I became an R.A. at Storey house where Susan Schofield lived, but she was a sophomore. Tracy: I read that somewhere. Thatâs funny. I wanted to ask you about that because I came across that in an article or something that I read. Mahoney: [00:19:27] Please have a cookie. Tracy: I will. Mahoney: [00:19:33] It was interesting that Mary Duryea Decker even hired me, because Iâd never lived in a dorm. Iâd been a commuting student to college. I didnât know what a dorm was. But I had some skill at making people feel that the community was worth their time, and although there were lots of rules for women that were not rules for men at Stanfordâhours and all that kind 20 of thingâI managed to walk a kind of path that didnât disturb the universe, and I really enjoyed that year. At the end of that year, I got a call from the associate dean of women, a woman named Bonnie Fitzwater, a Texan who still had a Dallas accent, and she asked if I would consider being the director of Branner Hall, which was the only womenâs residence on the Wilbur-Stern side of the campus. That idea was sufficiently preposterous that I said yes. In the middle of that year, the then dean of women, Lucille Allen, got herself into serious hot water. It was alleged that she had alleged that freshmen English T.A.âs were seducing freshmen women. Now, those people so accused, even on the rumor side, were my friends. Over the course of several weeks, she resigned. She had come to Stanford from Cornell and was quite a distinguished person among deans of women nationally, but she wasnât good for us at the time. That also was the year of the Mississippi Summer followed by the autumn in which various civil rights activists went to Mississippi to register people for the mock elections, and among the sponsors, as undergraduate R.A.âs were called, my head sponsor went, and this was in October after that dreadful summer. Bob Byers, the director of the news serviceâthere was a cluster of people from my dorm, Marlie Shenck, Pat Stell, David Harris went. Several people went, men and women, and they flew to New Orleans and then they got a car with Mississippi licenses and went to Mississippi. What Bob Byers understood was that the thing that could be done to keep them safe was to give them a lot of news spotlight so that people knew who they 21 were, knew that reporters were following them, and he went to Mississippi and he made contact with people who could help him with that agenda. They were there at least a week, maybe longer, and Marlie was tasked by the dean of women, who had authorized them to go, to call me every night at seven oâclockâso it would have been ten oâclock in Mississippiâ just to check in, that they were still all right. So I would stay in my apartment and wait for that call to come. The night that we thought they were going to leave Mississippi, Marlie called. Every night students would gather in my living room, sit on the floor, and wait for Marlieâs news. So I would bring the phone into the living room and talk with her. I said something like, âHow are you leaving Mississippi?â And instead of answering me, she hung up. I put the phone down, because I knew the dean of women was going to ask me that question, and I said to one of the graduate students who was there, I said, âShe hung up on me when I asked how she was going to get out.â And one of the freshmen, this childlike person, looked at me and with great wisdom said, âThat phone was probably tapped, and if she told you, she might not get out.â And I said, âOh.â Then I said to myself, âThatâs what I could tell the dean.â [laughter] And thatâs what I told the dean. And they got back two or three days later. The civil rights activity was the beginning of something at Stanford. Faculty supported the students who engaged in that work, and faculty were 22 generous in letting them go and letting them make up work and do whatever had to be done. So in the middle of that year, this, quote, âscandalâ came, with respect to the dean, and I got called by Don Winbigler, who was then the dean of students. Don later became academic secretary for the university. He was a professor of drama. He called me to his office, and I had no idea why, and he asked me would I consider leaving Branner next year and going to Roble. Roble was on the other side of campus where other womenâs dorms were, and it was larger by 50 percent than Branner. And I said, âWell, yes, but Iâm barely getting to know Branner.â He said, âWell, you know Dean Allen resigned.â Dean Fitzwater, her associate dean, had resigned, and then Betsy Avery and Judy Hannemann resigned. Well, I was too dumbâand the director of Roble had resigned, and maybe the director of Lagunita had resigned. And he said, âYou have more experience than anybody else on the staff.â Now, I had ten monthsâ experience. And he said, âRoble is the place where most of our alumnae lived.â Branner didnât come along until later. And I said, âSure.â Well, that year was very impactful for me, because I made a friend ofâand he made a friend of meâof Albert Guerard, who had a lot of Ford Foundation money for something called the Voice Project. The Voice Project was a different approach to the teaching of freshman writing. So he wanted to make sure that even though I had this full-time job, he went to the dean and asked if I could please teach freshman writing again, and he wanted me engaged in the Voice Project. 23 Then over the course of the year, because he had moneyânobody else did, but he did, and he also had people like the novelist John Hawkes, who came out to teach writing. I mean, it was a lively, exciting, intellectually exciting group. I went to him and I said, âIâd like to have an art exhibit, a set of poetry readings, and a whole creative thing, maybe for four or five days including the weekend, and invite faculty,â and it would be all freshmen from Stern and Wilbur and Branner and Roble. Itâd be good, and we could publicize it through the freshman writing program. I knew kind of what I wanted to do, but I thought it would be worth peopleâs time and people would take it more seriously as a real thing if he put up some money for some prizes for drawings and we had several sets of prizes. Well, he did, and it was quite wonderful. I didnât quite understand at the time, though I think this had something to do with it, I had been a graduate student in English. This was the English department that had been tarnished by these allegations. Whether they were true or not true, it hadnât been good. Suddenly, my interaction with the Dean of Students Office, which is what I worked for, as the director of Roble, I belonged to the Deanâs Office, but I also belonged to the English department. That helped make peace and good working relationships. So we did that and had a terrific time. It was great fun because faculty came and read, and students got up and read their poems, and the facultyâs poems were equally acceptable to be heard, and it was very nice. 24 At the end of that year, Don Winbigler decided to leave the Dean of Students Office, and something was set up for him to be academic secretary, and I didnât quite understand what that was about. So Iâd been one year at Branner and one year at Roble. I then went into the Dean of Students Office and wasâassistant dean of women. I was assistant dean of something for residences, and the idea was to work with the faculty to get advisors into residences and to encourage resident fellows and to encourage the kind of thing I had done at Roble elsewhere. Joel Smith came in as dean of students. Now, Joel Smith had no long history at Stanford. He had gone, I think, to Oberlin and graduated from there. He had been a Marshall Scholar to Oxford. At Oxford he met people from Stanford who were working on degrees. No, they werenât from Stanford. They were people working on Oxford degrees who wound up at Stanford. Ron Rebholtz and Martin Evans were two. He came back and went to the University of Wisconsin to law school, but was looking for other things because he really didnât want to practice law. It was intellectually interesting, but courtrooms and litigation and what people did in lawyersâ offices didnât interest him. Someone suggested that he get involved with the university, and how he got here, I donât know, but he was in the Development Office, I think doing some legal work for Daryl Pearson, working for Ken Cuthbertson. And all of a sudden, he was the dean of students. Boom! After a short time, there were a lot of different kinds of activities going on, Berkeley protests had started. We werenât Berkeley, but there were 25 activist students asking questions and questioning authority and beginning of discussions about why do women have rules that men donât, those kinds of things. So Iâm in the Dean of Students Office, Joel came to the Deanâs Office. Don had gone to some other place on the campus for a while and had his little office under the stairwell. He asked to see me, and I thought this was nice. This was the new guy. And he said, âI want you to stay on.â And I said, âOh?â And he said, âNot many of your colleagues will be staying on.â Tracy: So he was cleaning house a little bit as dean of students? Mahoney: [00:34:47] Yes, he was. The dean of men went away, various people went away whom I didnât know very well because Iâd only been there eight or nine months. All these changes happened, and Iâm the last hired and Iâm not the first fired. Iâm the first kept. Tracy: Interesting. Mahoney: [00:35:10] I took to saying to people, as the history of my activity at Stanford got longer, âIâm the last employee of the last dean of women at Stanford.â Then things changed and I became somebody elseâs employee over time. Then Wally Sterling announced his intention to retire, and as part of that announcement, he announced Study of Education at Stanford (SES). It was one of these gatherings of the entire Academic Council, which used to meet once a year, and they heard a State of the University Address from the president. As a dean, I went to that meeting. All the deans in the Dean of Students Office went to that meeting. He announced that he would be 26 retiring and that in his last year he would be establishing a Study of Education at Stanford, which, when completed, would help his successor have the view of the faculty and, indeed, the university as to possible directions. It would be a kind of relook at things. But when you look at the Study of Educationâhave you seen those books? Tracy: Yes. Mahoney: [00:36:50] I am looking for some of those books, because I have two of some and none of others. He was not president any longer when the various reports were generated, and it was interesting to me that the letter from the Steering Committee turning over the reports of the Study of Education at Stanford is addressed to three people: Chancellor Sterling, Acting President Robert Glaser, and President Designate Ken Pitzer. As I think about what SES was, there was a committee that produced a report on university residences in campus life. There was one on admission and financial aid. There was one on graduate education, which wasnât very good, and it got redone. There was one on advising and counseling, one on undergraduate education, one on the extra curriculum. So what you see in SESâand then I was part of Joelâs work. Joel was tasked to staff the Committee on University Residences and Campus Life somehow, which was chaired by Lew Spitz, a professor in the history department. He took me to the first meeting of the committee and announced that he was its staff but I would do all the work, which was fine. I mean, it was interesting. But everybody laughed. So I became quite engaged 27 in how people were thinking about residences, and I had had the history of working with the English faculty at Roble and with faculty residents, as we then called them, in some of the dorms. There was an image about what both the faculty wanted to accomplish, and what Joel and IâI had less policy influence, but I certainly agreed I wanted to support. As I think about the SES, as I see it, Sterling and Terman built the faculty. SES said pay attention to students and make sure you have a student body that can benefit from the faculty we are trying to bring together here. So whether itâs the admission and financial aid report or the residencesâ report or the extra curriculum report, the focus is on your graduates and the focus is on raising the bar, integrating intellectual life and the social lives of students, finding a place for athletics and other parts of the extra curriculum, all of those kinds of things. So I dutifully went to those meetings once, often, every other week and sometimes more often and did research, and we then had an opportunity toâBob Glaser was, I think, acting president, and there was the, you know, when you have lemons, make lemonade. Some fraternity up in the cluster on the lake, I think maybe the Phi Delts, got themselves into some kind of serious trouble and were suspended and had to vacate the building. [Tracy laughs.] Well, Joel said, âLetâs put something experimental and interesting in there.â So that was when the next thing I knew, I had to take care of Mark Mancall, who was known as an assistant professor of history who was on the Steering Committee of SESâmaybe he was an associate professor, but he 28 wasnât more than thatâand who had wild ideas that were interesting and was, a little bit in part because of his size, a bull in a China shop. So we made Grove House work, and Grove House was to be men and women. It was our first venture into coed housing on the Stanford campus. It was to have an intellectual dimension that was course-based, and it was to engage faculty and other visitors. It had an agenda. My job was to make sure it happened, and I canât remember what happened to make the board agree to this, other than it was just exciting and it was an experiment, and the Phi Delts would come back. I had roles like liaison to the food service. Mark wanted after-dinner coffee in the living room so the faculty could come, and there would be cookies and coffee. The food service was used to closing down when people stopped eating in the dining rooms. When Mark asked for this thing that he thought was fairly standard, and was when he had lived in Harvard houses as a graduate student, and it seemed ordinary to him. And it was ordinaryâand this is importantâoverseas. The food service saw cockroaches. People will leave this debris. Well, Mark ran the house by saying, âThis is Mancallâs Maoist democracy. Everybody can express an opinion, and Mancall decides.â Thatâs what that meant. And one of the things that Mancall had decided was that after coffee and cookies, two or three students of an evening would take the responsibility for cleaning the place up so that there would be no cockroaches or anything else untoward. Well, the director of university food 29 service, Maxine Anderson, by the end of that year would have done anything for Mark Mancall. She was excited. The kids were excited. Then SES and Joel said to me, âWe have to make this bigger.â So we had four project houses, two of them in Stern. One of them was going to be Grove House because it needed a place, and it went to Donner. And another place in Stern, where Bob Freelen was with Marcy, Freelen, who was then his wife, and he had a daughter. Then in Wilbur, John Chowning and somebody else. So there were four houses. Freelen had a social service house. Chowning had a music house. Mancall had his Grove House. I went to the board meeting where that was discussed and where the presentation was made by Smith. The lever was: this is like overseas studies. Europeans, we donât have places in Europe where men live in one house and women live in another. Europeans donât understand that. Weâre lucky to be able to get a facility. But we have usually two faculty couples and forty or fifty students at Beutelsbach or wherever, and thereâs intellectual energy. Itâs exciting. People love their overseas experience. There are two memories that the typical Stanford student of the time and even since have, and one of them is where did you live as a freshman, and the other was what was your overseas studies campus. So those were compelling experiences. So Joel made the presentation to the board, which was a little nervous about coed housing, based on the experience of overseas, that this wasnât all that novel, it was simply bringing overseas home. We started overseas studies because we wanted to experiment, and that was well developed now, so we should bring it home. They bought it. 30 Two psychologists or social scientists of one sort of another, one, Nevitt Sanford, and the other, Joe Katz, were part of an institute on the row, and after we opened the four houses, they did a series of questionnaires and observations of the four houses, and it was novel enough so that we got phone calls from all over the country about these four houses. By this time, I am your friendly assistant dean, then associate dean for residential education. Iâm not assistant dean of women for residences. Iâm residential education, which is what the SES wanted it called. Nevitt Sanford and Joe Katz came up with a paper that said coed houses operate on the basis of an incest taboo and that people were not sexually active with one another in coed houses. Now, they didnât say these students may be active with people in the house next door, but they said this is family life. I didnât know whether their research was good, bad, or indifferent, but when I got phone calls, McCallâs magazine, Good Housekeeping magazine, deans at various schools, I quoted Nevitt Sanford and Joe Katz, said, âI see no reason to say anything else. I see this too,â and then put the phone down. [Tracy laughs.] But I must have had, in the course of a year, fifty calls, and I am forever grateful to those two men because it allowed us to move forward. Then gradually the whole system turned over. Going back to the forties, there was a sorority system at Stanford, and women who were not in sororitiesâor after sororities, the whole question of how you were going to fill both the sorority houses and the other houses, and what everybody agreed to was a random draw, and so there was the womenâs draw. It was 31 operated by a woman who ran the Housing Assignment Office, and we adapted that for access to coed housing. Up to that point, women had to live on campus. Men didnât have to, and men who didnât live in fraternity houses tended to live off campus. It was affordable. And nobody wanted to live in Stern, so Stern was quite empty. It had a vacancy rate that was not something that made the financial people very happy. Well, when we overturned the system, men came back to campus because campus was more interesting than cooking on your own ramen noodles off campus. One day we were visited by this gentleman from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton, and he was doing a study about whether Princeton should go coed as an institution. I said various things to him, and mostly I didnât understand what he was saying, because Stanford had been coed from the beginning. The five hundred that Mrs. Stanford had instructed wasnât in her day a really small number, and men had been gradually honored in the breach as a proportion over the years. So our limit on women students up to coed housing was the number of beds that could be put in Roble and Branner. Once we had coed housing, we didnât need to limit the number of women. Now I donât know that anybody had that in mind. I know nobody had that in mind, but it was the consequence that meant there was flexibility about numbers. There was a crisis in the number of women who accepted. Admission was too high. You got into double singles and triple doubles and all those things. But coed housing gave us that freedom and gave the Admissions Office freedom. 32 Tracy: One question in thinking about this progression of womenâs housing. When did all of these sort of rules and regulations special to women, like curfew and whatnot, when in the process did that go by the wayside? Mahoney: [00:53:49] When we went co-ed, and I remember this vividly, because it was clear to me that nobody honored it in the four project houses and no one asked any questions. Certainly Joel Smith was not going to ask me questions about that, as the dean of women once upon a time asked me. That was not part of it. But it was clear that our choices were to apply the same rules to men as to women or vice versa, and I remember that someone down in the Provostâs Office which had a sizeable staff.âthere were two people in the Provostâs Office who were interesting to me. One was Howard Brooks, who was vice provost and who, interestingly, had a daughter who lived at Roble when I was its director. I remember once he came into my office on his way to visit Joel Smith, and he said, âOh, I just wanted to know who you were. I donât think weâve ever met. Iâm Howard Brooks, and you know my daughter.â And I said, âOh, sure, I know your daughter,â who was by then a junior. He said, âShe thinks youâre good,â and he walked out. I said, âThank you.â The other was Herb Packer, and Herb Packer was a visionary for the university and for faculty governance, which is, of course, one of the books of SES. But somebody had an idea down there that what we should do is ask 33 the parents of women students to give us permission to let their daughters not have to have rules. And I remember hearing that at ten oâclock in the morning at some meeting, and I was going to have to be the enforcer of this, the administrator enforcer of it. I went back to my office, and I had behind my desk a red IBM Selectric typewriter with a correction ribbon, and I simply sat down and wrote a memo to Joel Smith which basically said, âWe canât do this. I am willing not to see us go with co-ed housing if we have to do this. We want out of the in loco parentis, and this puts us squarely in for the foreseeable future there.â It must have been Glaser was still the acting president, and JoelâI still remember thisâhe took my piece of paper with its misspellings and its runon sentences, and he took it down to Building 10. And the next thing I knew, Herb Packer was at the door of my office saying, âYou persuaded us.â I didnât knowâI mean, I knew who he was. He was this little man who always had a different jacket on every day. He had more clothes than anybody I ever knew. I didnât know Joel had taken my paper. And Joel was with him, and Joel said, âWeâre going to take it your way.â And I said, âOh, thank you.â Then three months later, Joel said to me, âYouâre now not assistant dean of students; youâre associate dean of students.â So I think that memo got me a promotion. But you just couldnât take the place co-ed and have those rules. 34 This nice man from Woodrow Wilson School went back to Princeton, and the next thing I know, Joel Smith was in my office saying Princeton wants to invite me to be a consultant to Princetonâs plans to go co-ed, and would I go to Princeton next week. There was a blizzard. Instead of going to Newark, we wound up going to Pittsburgh and then coming back by bus and train. I missed the big session, but I was part of the group that included Peggy Bunting, the president of Radcliffe College, the woman who was out at UCLA who had been the president of Barnard, and various other people. They still had in mind parietal rules, etc., for these new women to Princeton. What I quickly understoodâNeil Rudenstine [Neil Leon Rudenstine] who subsequently became the president of Harvard, was dean of students at Princeton, and Goheen [Robert Francis Goheen] was the president of Princeton, and Bowen [William G.Bowen], who became president of Princeton, was the provost. I get there. Iâm late. One of the things I know is all these women are far more distinguished than I am. Iâm an associate dean in a Dean of Students Office, and these people are presidents of their institutions, they are learned, but I have the experience of this kind of thing. And Princeton is losing students to Stanford, men students, because they were all men at the time. I arrive and they give me this kind of protocol that has been suggested to them about women at Princeton. Weâre having breakfast since I wasnât there the night before. I realized that Iâd just better speak up, and I say, âThe women who are going to sign up 35 to apply to Princeton are doing so because theyâre going to be pioneers, and they know it. Youâve been here since before the Republic. There is abroad in the land a kind of resistance to these [parietal rules]. Itâs not yet taken hold. I donât think that the women who come here as pioneers are going to put up with it, unless, of course, youâre prepared to tell Princeton men that they have to be bound by the same rules,â basically my argument at Stanford some months before. They all looked at me and they said âI remember Bowen was the first to speak, and he said, âYouâre right, of course.â He looked over at Goheen and said, âWho do you think we have to sell this to?â And it was this man from the Wilson School and Rudenstine, and Rudenstine was relieved. I then went to a session with Princeton students, and I knew somehow that Princeton was going to make this transition OK, but they didnât have any experiences that Stanford took for granted. I met with a group of students, and this really smart-alecky kid said, âYou know what this game is. Princeton needs more students, and theyâre having a hard time getting men, so they think theyâll continue on a better trajectory towards more men if they also have women and that they can get quality up and numbers up at the same time.â And I said, âWell, no one has said that to me.â And he said, âTrust me. Bowen is an economist.â And I said, âOK.â I must have asked some question about what things do you think might be unsettling to the men at the Princeton if there are women here, and this 36 same kid said to me, âWell, weâre going to complain when the line for reserved books in the library is longer, and weâre going to blame the women when, in fact, we should be blaming Bowen for increasing the size of the student body.â He was absolutely right. I went back afterwards and said to Bowen, âYour students are pretty smart, and this is what theyâre saying. Let me pass it on to you.â And he just laughed. So I came home. Princeton went coed, but one of the last things they said to me as we toured, they kept saying to me, âWhat did you have to do when you made menâs dorms OK for women as well as men?â And I said, âWell, not much. We did make sure that every hall had an ironing board and an iron and a mirror.â âWell, what did you do with the urinals?â âWell, we put boxes around them.â âWell, what did you do with the furniture? Because men are taller than women.â And I said, âSome time ago, we bought 80-inch beds for everybody, and thatâs what men need.â But what I didnât understand was that only once in its 300-year history had Princeton ever bought furniture for students. It didnât know anything more about furniture than the most naÃ¯ve person in any school I can think of. The reason was that in the old days when Princeton students were from a rather narrow band of affluent familiesâ [telephone interruption] 37 Tracy: So before we stopped, we were talking about Princetonâs ability to buy furniture. Mahoney: [01:05:07] Well, Princeton students had brought their own furniture with them, and at the end of every spring, seniors sold their furniture to the students who were behind them, and then other students sold to freshmen, who brought some things in. It must have been a big yard sale, but some of these things were antiques. As they began, really long before they started admitting women, they began to recruit students who didnât have the financial means to bring furniture to school. So once, some years before, they had bought furniture for the dorms and told students who had furniture, âIf you want an easy chair, keep it, but, by and large, the university will provide basic furniture.â So that set the stage for them thinking, âOh, my, what will we have to do for women?â And my answer was, âNot very much. The women will maybe decorate their rooms in a way thatâs different from the way that men do, but thatâs because their mothers and fathers will have accompanied them to school in some cases. But other than that, you donât have to worry about this,â which kind of amused me, but relieved them. So that was the Princeton thing, and there is a little tiny book about the recommendation that Princeton go co-ed that thanks the group of us who were their advisors. So that was a fun thing that happened in that period of time after we got ResEd [Residential Education] sort of going. 38 Tracy: I think itâs good to point out that the idea of Residential Education was really something that developed, not just at Stanford but was not necessarily a recognized field, and, as you said, you were given the term âResidential Education,â but the concept was developed over this time that youâre describing at Stanford, that it wasnât as cohesive of a thing when you came into Branner and Roble. Mahoney: [01:07:53] Oh, absolutely not, as evidenced by the fact that men didnât want to stay at Stern, moved off campus. But for Stanford, its originsâor not its origins, but it drew on the experience of overseas studies, which, while not uniqueâcertainly not unique now. Stanford was among the first institutions in this country to have overseas study sites where people came together in enclaves with faculty, and we learned a lot from that. What I was thinking the other day was I [next] moved into doing some other things with Joel. Doug Davis, who was a man who had been director of Wilbur at one point and then came into the Deanâs Office, got more involved with Residential Education. Joel would have me do things, and one of them was the Cowell thing. Sometime before I came to Stanford, and I donât know how much time before, but it must have been the late fifties, early sixties, because that would have been the period of time when the Food and Drug Administration approved oral contraceptives, Cowell Student Health Service prescribed contraception when students came and asked for it, and they didnât make distinctions between graduate students and undergraduates. I donât know that they told anybody, but they were physicians, and thatâs what they did. 39 A parent of an undergraduate studentâand I donât know anything about it other than this outlineâdiscovered that their daughter was a user of contraception that she had acquired at Cowell Student Health Service. The family threatened to sue the university because they said she was a minor, and to do such a thing without a parentâs permission was to inflict a battery on a child. So very quickly, Sterling said, âNo.â It wasnât clear whether he said no to graduate students, but he certainly said no to undergraduates. So that was the policy. I didnât think much of it one way or the other. I didnât know much about it. When Sterling stepped aside, the acting president was a physician; he was dean of the medical school, Bob Glaser. Joel came into my office one day, and he said, âMac Osborn [Maurice Osborn MD] and I have a task for you and Marion Shikamura [Marion Shikamura MD]â whom I knew to be one of the really fine doctors at Cowell and very elegant and calm and thoughtful and sensible in many ways. He said, âWe need to find a way to deal with the contraception issue, and I want you to find it.â [Tracy laughs.] And it was he who told me about this history of this policy. I didnât know Marion very well, but I called her, and what we agreed to do was she would call physicians at the Student Health Services around and about, and I would call deans of students, vice presidents for student affairs, whatever, and see if anybody would tell us what they did, both in California and outside. California was relevant because there are state laws. Indeed, to go back to housing, it is the state hotel code that defines where you can put men and women in a coed house, and in a hotel downtown in San Francisco, 40 if your rooms donât have bathrooms and the bathrooms are in the hallway, there have to be two sets, that men can use one and women can use the other. So state law applies to all sorts of things, honored now mostly in the breach or with an addition of facilities. So I got on the phone. Everybody was holier-than-thou and said, âOf course not. We would have to have parent permission.â And when you say âparent permissionâ to me, my blood boils. I called Marion. Well, Marion had found several directors of health services who, in fact, prescribed even thought their bosses had told me, âOh, no.â Tracy: Thatâs funny. Mahoney: [01:13:40] I said, âMarion, how many of these people you talked to have told their bosses?â And she said, âHalf.â It was maybe three and three she had called. She had gotten yeses from six. She had called about ten. Then I called UCLA and I got some guy, a vice president named Barney something. I donât remember his last name. He said, âOh, yes, we prescribe contraception. You people up there ought to know this. Itâs your state legislator.â I said, âOur state legislator? What do you mean?â He said, âJohn Vasconcellos [John Bernard Vasconcellos],â who indeed was in the Assembly or the Senate. Weâd already had the San Francisco Summer of Love and all that, and throughout San Francisco in emergency rooms and in clinics near the Haight, there would be these spaced-out kids show up on some form of drug and 41 needing medical attention, but they couldnât be provided because this was a battery on a runaway or whatever. So Vasconcellos had put through a law in California that had passed both houses and had been signed by whoever was the governor. It might have been Jerry Brown. It was: any minor living apart from home, which UCLA construed to be a dormitory, and managing funds, regardless of source. So if your grandmother slipped you money or your mother slipped you money when you were a runaway in the Haight, you were managing funds regardless of source, including family. Such people can give consent to medical treatment as if they were adults, and that had become the law in California. I called Marion, and I said, âBingo.â I remember saying to this fellow Barney, âIs anybody else in the UC system doing this?â He said âBerkeley is, but they wonât tell you. Davis is, and they will tell you.â So I called Davis. So I got confirmation from two UC institutions, and Marion and I wrote a report to our respective bosses saying, âThis is the deal.â Glaser approved a policy change at Cowell, which Pitzer did not change. It was very interesting, but it wouldnât have happened, I think at the time, (a), if Smith had not taken the initiative, and then if I hadnât found the dean who knew about John Vasconcellos, because when I brought it up and we talked about it, no one knew about this. I remember calling Milton Marks, who was a state senator from San Francisco. He drove every day from San Francisco and back. He had a 42 driver. So he went to bar mitzvahs and he went to funerals, and he knew everything and everybody, and heâd take your call. So I called and I said, âWe understand John Vasconcellos says that this is the case. Are you able to verify it?â Because Vasconcellos was known as kind of flakey. And Marks said, âOh, yes. Doctors in San Francisco didnât want young people dying in the streets, and we needed to do something.â So thatâs the history of that policy change at Stanford, attributed to hippies in San Francisco. Tracy: Was there ever any challenge to it? Mahoney: [01:18:13] No. I think by that time, things had shifted nationally and otherwise, and people knew that we were no longer in loco parentis, knew thatâI mean, it was just a different time. During all that time, we were beginning to getâBerkeley had happened. Thereâd been issues at Stanford that I donât think most of the student body was involved in, most of the student body was not involved in, but there had been the fire in Sterlingâs office and sit-ins here and there. Then Joel [Joel Pritchard Smith] went off to be president of Denison. He was succeeded by a man named Peter Buckley, who was a mechanical engineer on the faculty. So it was the faculty wanting an academic in the Dean of Students Office. He had a wonderful history in engineering of working with students, and he was very creative. He was one of the founders of this so-called Design Division. He wasnât very articulate. He, for example, was the person who had been responsible for what everybody on campus knew in the spring as the Garbage Can Race. Engineers got garbage cans of 43 one kind or another, and they had to float them with them in rowboat style across Lake Lagunita without sinking. I remember at a staff meeting, when he first became dean, asking him why? What did this thing do? Why did he think that was important? I mean, really. Tracy: It was his thing. Mahoney: [01:20:43] Right, and he was excited to have done this. This was his claim to fame. He was the professor of the Garbage Can Race. But he couldnât say why. Then one day we were walking over together for coffee at Tresidder. He said, âDamn it, Sally. Engineers canât take risks. You badly design an airplane wing, and people die. We needed something that not only would be fun, but had minimal risk for the mechanical engineering design principles people were pushing the envelope for.â And I thought, âOh, you did have a reason.â But he had remembered that for what had been months after we had the first conversation. He was very interested in looking at crowds that would be in White Plaza or headed to the Old Union or whatever and talking about what do people see? Was the crowd really angry? One day he came to a staff meeting and he brought several cameras, and he suggested that when crowds gathered on White Plaza that we go out into White Plaza and take pictures, and then weâd all come back and talk about what we saw. I remember John Hanson, who was associate dean for counseling at the time and then left to go as dean of students to another institution, he 44 said, âPeter, thatâs dangerous. I like Stanford, but Iâm not prepared to die for it.â And we all kind of went [demonstrates]. He didnât understand that that was dangerous. We probably would have survived if we did it, but we just said we wouldnât do it. That was how I got to the Provostâs Office. Peter was going to go away. He was going to go as president, as a dean, to something in Indiana, to Bradley, and he was going to go away, but he was going to, quote, âclean things upâ for his successor, whoever that would be. Tracy: So Peter wasnât inâhow long was Peter in? Mahoney: [01:23:40] Only a couple of years. Tracy: Yes. So not very long. Mahoney: [01:23:42] Not very long. Then one afternoon I got a call from Dick Lymanâs secretary. He was provost. She said, âSally, Mr. Lyman would like to see you this evening if possible. Can you come over about five oâclock?â And I said, âSure.â I put the phone down, and I thought, âI donât know Mr. Lyman. What does he want? What should I bring?â So I called back and I talked to Evelyn, and I said, âEvelyn, you didnât say what Mr. Lyman wants to talk about. Is there any material I should bring?â She said, âIâll check.â So she called me back and she said, âNo, just come.â 45 I decided that what was going on was that Peter didnât want to fire me before he left because too many people on the faculty liked working with me and I liked working with them, so he was asking Dick Lyman to do it. So thatâs my mindset when I went to see Dick Lyman. We sat in those two leather chairs that Dick dragged around the world that got seedier and seedier, and he began the conversation by saying nice things and then saying, âYou know, I donât know what you want to do over time, but does it occur to you that youâre getting to have been a long time in the Dean of Students Office?â Reinforcement, Iâm about to be fired. I saidâI donât know, hem, haw. And he said, âSo we down here have been talking about you, and there are changes that weâre going to have to be making because Howard and Ray, Ray is doing summer session.â Tracy: Was this Ray Bacchetti? Mahoney: [01:26:04] Bacchetti. âHeâs going to have to move over to work more with Howard.â And Howard, I didnât notice at the time, was about to go to be provost of the several [Claremont] Colleges and then he subsequently became president of the womenâs college, Scripps College. And he said, âSo we need someone to come into the office to be director of summer session and assistant provost, replacing Ray.â I didnât know who Ray was, and I said, âWhat does Ray do?â And he said, âWell, he runs summer session and makes sure that the four schools that have summer session do something, and then he does whatever the provost needs having done. Thatâs what you would do.â He 46 paused and he said, âYouâre associate dean of students. You wouldnât be assistant to the provost; you would be assistant provost.â And I was supposed to say, âYes, oh, wonderful,â but I said, âI think before I say yes, I want to talk to Ray Bacchetti. I donât want to complain, but you havenât been very specific, and I want to know whether I think I can do this job you want me to do.â He laughed and he said, âThey tell me that youâre very cautious, but not always.â And I said, âWell, Iâm cautious about building up confidence that I can do what people want me to do.â I no sooner had opened the door to my apartment than the phone rang, and it was Ray Bacchetti, who said, âYou didnât say yes.â I said, âYou know, Iâm honored by this confidence that Mr. Lyman has, but I donât know what you do. As a matter of fact, I donât even know who you are. If I passed you in the hall, I wouldnât know you.â He said, âWell, come see me at seven-thirty in the morning,â and so I did. I told Mr. Lyman I would come. But it was funny how I got to the Provostâs Office. Tracy: If you had not taken the position in the Provostâs Office, would you have been able to maintainâwould you have been kept on in dean of students? Mahoney: [01:28:37] I have no idea. What I do know is that Jim Lyons replaced Peter Buckley. It was a national search. He was much more a traditional dean of students than Joel Smith ever was, and I resonated with Joel, and I didnât 47 know enough about Jim Lyons to have a view of him, and I didnât have to have a view of him because I had moved, so it was fine. But then over time, we had Mr. Pitzer as president, and he was a funny, charming man that nobody ever saw as funny and charming because they didnât know him, and he didnât last very long. It was a hellish time. By that time, lots of things were heating up. Over the prior five years we had sit-ins in the Old Union, and theyâd come up to the third floor. They had taken over a Xerox machine and they had taken over Joelâs office, and we had the police in. But they were internal issues, a little bit on the war but mostly internal issues. The admission ofâafter the assassination of Martin Luther Kingâ the whole business of students of color, began with African Americans. Tracy: Thatâs the well-known event with the Black Student Union interrupting the memorial on campus. Mahoney: [01:30:44] Right. Well, it was a meeting of the Academic Council, so all the faculty was there and Dick was speaking. This kid came from stage left and took the microphone out of his hand. I still remember Dick just freezing. And, I donât know, this kid went on and on. By this time, we had several [other] things [going on] in the Dean of Students Office. One, Bill somebody or other, [Leland] because of Vietnam, had become a counselor to students who wanted to conscientious objectors. He had a big entourage. I was in the Dean of Students Office. Bill [a different Bill], every time the draft would want him, went on an eating binge and became too fat. Literally, thatâs how he kept himself out, because he 48 didnât want to go. Peoria, Illinois, would never have understood if Bill became a C.O. So he simply became unfit. Everybody at Stanford was loaded into San Joseâs draft board, and Bill [Leland], who had been director of the Stern complex, was working with the faculty there, was really a very able counselor, and he saw that every student at Stanford went to San Jose. So it got so mucked up with so many people, most of whom didnât live except temporarily in San Jose, but they didnât know what to do, so nobody paid any attention. They either got C.O. status or they got strung out long enough for the draft to be over. It didnât matter much. They just didnât go. At the time we started to look for African American students and then American Indian students and then Hispanics students, whom we called Chicano at the time. There was some kind of to-do. We had hired a guy named Jim Simmons. I donât quite know who hired him, but he was the special assistant to the president for African American affairs. After one of these altercations, sit-ins, they were still sitting-in, but they were going off to an office to decide what to do. One of the issues was to bring an end to the legacy preference of children of Stanford alums, which was never very much of a preference, nothing like the preference at Princeton or at Yale. Also until well into the sixties, we barely had enough male applicants to make a class. We had too many women but not enough men. So our view had to be of men up in the 75 to 80 percent range, and there was all this to-do about legacies. 49 Then they went off, and Jim Simmons came back the next morning and said, âThey are withdrawing their demand that we give up the legacy preference.â I remember somebody saying to him, âHow did that get accomplished?â And he said, âSomebody in the room said, âTwenty-five years from now, our kids will have preference.ââ Took it off the table. Some of them later became trustees. Charles Ogletree is a professor of law at Harvard. I mean, these people were smart. But all of that was going on, and Dick was really left holding the bag in terrible ways. I remember Lyle Nelson was director of campus communication or whatever it was called, the vice president for public affairs, and Bob Byers was his new service person. Bob had been around a long time, started Campus Report, started the Observer, kept saying, âStanford has to tell the truth. Thatâs the easiest way to get through the troubles. We have to tell whatâs true,â would not allow Campus Report or the Observer to be edited by the administration. From time to time, I think where the leadership group came to realize that they didnât know what to do about Pitzer. There was some sit-in, and Pitzer had been in the East. I donât know whether it was weather or whatever, he didnât get back on time, and they didnât want to call the police without Pitzer. Well, he never showed up that night. So it was Dick who had to call the police to clear whatever. It was probably the Old Union. 50 Then the next day or two, it was discovered that Pitzer had come home and had not come down to campus. I just remember nobody wanted to talk about it. Nobody. Pitzer went out of his way to thank Dick and to say, âYou did exactly the right thing,â but it was a moment in which when you call the cops, you lose control. We were lucky. We werenât Berkeley. We didnât have Ed Meese as our district attorney and the sheriff who worked with Ed Meese with teargas on campus. Our D.A. and our sheriff understood that our kids were going to be leaders when they grew up, and this was something that they would have to get through. So it was done, but it was done carefully, but, nevertheless, because you never know what will get out of control. So then Pitzer thought about resigning, and the word was that he would or he wouldnât, and he couldnât make up his mind. Lyle Nelson went up to the house. The story we heard from Bob Byers. Finally, Pitzer had written out a letter of resignation or maybe typed it out, I donât know, but it was unsigned. Lyle must have sat with him for quite a while and said, âDo you think itâs time for you to sign this?â He said, âYes,â and he signed it. Lyle picked it up, went to the front door of Hoover House, and handed it to Bob Byers, who was standing in the entryway, and Bob Byers gave it to the press. That was the announcement that Pitzer had resigned. How the board worked on that, I donât know, but very quickly Dick got made president and Bill Miller came in. 51 But those were very difficult times. I came into the Provostâs Office because Ray had to work on finance, and that was the first downsizing. That was the Budget Adjustment Program, followed by the Budget Equilibrium Program three or four years later. So in all this turmoil, we also had to think about tuition. We had to think about expenditure levels. SES had said youâve got to pay attention to undergraduates. As we enrolled more students who didnât look like the âtypicalâ Stanford student, we needed resources to support them while we were working on getting African Americans. The other thing, and I donât quite know why, a fellow named Doug Davis was very interested in American Indians, and he pulled a group of us together to recruit American Indians that we didnât know anything about. One of the physicians at the Health Service, who subsequently became director after Mac Osborne left, and Doug somehow knew, and one of the faculty in the English department had worked as a conscientious objector, he had been assigned to the Navajo Nation to work with Indians. That was the Second World War conscientious objectors. Virgil Whitaker was his name. We started calling around to schools on reservations and the boarding schools, and then we found in Alaska Jesuits who ran schools for the Indians. Then we realized that Bob Northâs wife was American Indian and that he had contacts in the Navajo Nation and that Virgil Whitaker had as one of his own students, Scott Momaday, who was Navajo and who had done a PhD at Stanford [with Ivor Winters]. So we proceeded to get on the phone and bring American Indians to Stanford. We were unprepared and they were unprepared. It took Dick 52 Lyman and most of Don Kennedyâs tenure before we had a hundred, because every one of them needed to be mentored one-on-one. But Dick managed to get those kinds of things done at the same time he was putting out fires. I said earlier that Stanfordâs issues were internal. They were about two things: they were about secret research and they were about ROTC. The reason SES structure for the faculty changed was, again, Memorial Auditorium. The faculty as a whole had to vote on academic policy. So if there was to be an end to secret research, the faculty as a whole had to vote. If there was to be an end to credit for ROTC, not the end of ROTC, the end of credit for ROTC, it had to be done in a committee of the whole faculty at Memorial Hall. Committees made proposals, proposals were heard, various people got up and said various things. I remember Ron Rebholz [Ronald A. Rebholz] talking about credit and all of this. But then the vote was a roll-call vote, not by rank but by alphabet, Adams to Zilch. It meant that assistant professors in some departments voted before their senior colleagues, who would decide their tenure. And it was awful. I remember coming back from the Academic Council vote on secret research, which really affected the science and engineering faculty and it affected our role with the Stanford Research Institute. People saying, âNever again. We have to find another way.â And Herb Packer gave us the other way. Itâs interesting to meâI read this the other nightâhow amazingly unchanged it has been for forty years. 53 But all of that got done, and Iâm the junior person in the pecking order. Summer session was fine. I enjoyed it. Dick said to me, when he offered me the job, he said, âI have talked with the four associate deans who will be your partners in the summer session side of this, and they all think thatâs OK.â Like, why wouldnât it be? Well, one of those four associate deans was a Mormon bishop who wasnât all sure that a woman should have this job. Tracy: Oh, boy. Mahoney: [01:45:58] [But she turned out to be] absolutely elegant and polite and helpful. Then a man in political science, James T. Watkins, who was not known as favoring women students, sent me this lovely note that said, âI look forward to teaching in your first summer session. James T. Watkins IV.â I thought, âGod.â People saw it as a much bigger deal than I did, and as some people saw it, Dick was much more brave than I had thought. I just wondered, you know, could I do the job. Then those first years, half the job was summer session and half the job was doing whatever the provost wanted me to do. [End of January 28, 2014 interview with Sally T. Mahoney] 54 STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROJECT: STANFORD STAFF ORAL HISTORY PROJECT INTERVIEWER: ALLISON TRACY INTERVIEWEE: SALLY T. MAHONEY DATE OF INTERVIEW: FEBRUARY 26, 2014 Tracy: Hi. This is Allison Tracy. It is February 26, 2014. Iâm here with Sally Mahoney to conduct our second session of our oral history interviews for the Stanford Historical Society. So, Sally, to start out, I wanted to go back to a couple questions I had from our first session. This first question is maybe sort of an inconsequential bit of information, but I was really curious. Weâd spoken about Lucille Allen and sort of what had happened with her in her position, but I was wondering if thereâs ever any conversations or inklings or anything that her position would be eliminated before sort of what unfolded that led to her being asked to leave. Because when she was asked to leave, they sort of went ahead and eliminated that position. I just was curious if that was on the horizon. Mahoney: [00:00:56] I was simply too junior to know anything about that, but it was very clear that the university acted very quicklyâBob Wert, Bob Hind, Joel Smith, Herb Packer, Dick Lymanâto see to it something else put in place, that it was time for functional assignments rather than gender-based assignments, although there was, after she left, nevertheless, they were 55 functional assignments, but there was always in that first year or two a man and a woman sharing the responsibility. Tracy: Interesting. And that slowly worked its way out of the system. Mahoney: [00:01:52] Right. Tracy: Interesting. Mahoney: [00:01:54] Right. But I remember when Don Winbigler [Hugh Donald Winbigler] asked me to go from Branner to Roble, at the end of the year I was at Branner, my first year in residence as a director. It was also the year of the Mississippi Summer, and I had R.A.s who went to Mississippi, as I mentioned the last time, and so there was a lot happening in the broader world. But what might have been happening in the context of Stanford, I had no idea. And I was rather surprised when he said to me, âI want you to go to Roble because so many Stanford women alumnae have lived at Roble,â because Branner came along, I guess, only after the Second World War, and that I was suddenly the most senior woman in the system was just implausible to me. And they brought people in, some of whom stayed, some of whom did not stay. Tracy: Interesting. Weâre jumping ahead in the timeline of what Iâm going to ask, but I sort of see it as a part of this same evolution. Iâm wondering about beyond the co-ed dorms or sort of the integration of men and women in the dorms and beyond your work in eliminating the parietal rules, how did Stanfordâs shift towards becoming truly coeducational and what other ways did you see that manifesting at that time, if there were other sort of notable 56 ways? Because it seems that a lot of this falls into maybe this broader shift ofâ Mahoney: [00:03:51] Well, a lot was going on around the country. I canât remember whether I mentioned to you that when Princeton was considering going coed, I went to Princeton. Yale was wrestling with that at the same time. At Harvard, Puseyâs gauntlet was, âThere will be no co-residence,â meaning coeducational residences, âwithout a single corporation.â So all around the country in elite universities, these things were going on. The element that seemed important at Stanford at the time, and for this reason and others, the fifties may have been more important than the boring time that most people think it was, because the fifties started, with a German Studies professor, the Overseas Studies Program, and I would say that the idea of faculty living in residence with students, and in some cases engaging in formal academic work, in other cases in informal work, was characteristic of that time and very different from the sense that faculty had of their colleagues who worked with students in Student Services, who were people who kept order and peace and whatever. So people in those roles came to see themselves as partners with faculty in the education of students. That was important, and it was articulated in SES somewhat later than Lucille Allen, but that was where we were moving to, and that was bringing us into the general environment that people talked about when they talked about the Harvard houses or the Yale colleges, that merger of academic and intellectual life in the non-classroom setting. That was important for us. But I canât think of anything else. The gender issues 57 per se, we talked about the Health Service and contraceptive. Itâs just all of the piece, I think. Did we talk about closing down the Counseling Center and merging it into Cowell? Tracy: Letâs talk about it for a couple of minutes, because I donât think we did, went into it in any detail. Mahoney: [00:07:28] In the same period of time that I was working with Marion Shikamura to deal with the Health Service issues, there was increasing concern that we had redundancy of psychological services. We had a Health Service that was getting much more sophisticated about student health and that focused on post-adolescent student health, came to have more of a psychiatric staff component than it might have had earlier. Then the question arose, why do we have psychiatric services one place for students and psychological services another place for students? Jack Black, who was a very well-regarded psychologist, headed the Counseling and Testing Service, as it was called, located on the third floor of the Old Union, down the hall from the dean of students. So Joel Smith asked me to take a look at that, which was really treading on very thin ice, because the psychologists talked about what they did as being about student health and what psychiatrists did was being about student illness, that kind of dichotomy. I talked to some of the deans, I talked to the law school dean. I was asked to talk to a couple of students by the associate dean, Keith Mann [J. Keith Mann], and I did. 58 You may remember that someone ran for vice president on McGovernâs ticket, a man who was a senator from Missouri, and it came up in the middle of that campaign that he had had psychiatric treatment. Tracy: That heâd actually had stays, multiple overnight stays inâ Mahoney: [00:09:47] In psychiatric facilities. And that created chaos in that campaign. Law students talked about how that, if known, would be held against them if they used a psychiatrist, so they used, they said, the Counseling and Testing Center, even when those psychologists felt they needed a psychiatrist and would refer them off campus because they didnât want a university record. That was wholly new to me, but we teased it apart, and we heightened the awareness of confidentiality and all the rest of it. Joel took the decision to close the Counseling and Testing Center. A couple of those staff members went over to Cowell, and others left the university. But it was making Cowell and indeed another set of services at Stanford more sophisticated, more intellectually âwith itâ than the system had been heretofore. So there were lots of those kinds of changes going on so that faculty could have greater confidence in the services being provided. Thatâs all I remember about it. Tracy: You brought up the SES, the Study of Education at Stanford, and one question that I had going back to that was in a broader sense, do you rememberâyou were involved more explicitly in the residential education portion of it. Mahoney: [00:11:42] Sure. 59 Tracy: But Iâm wondering in a broader sense how SES changed Stanfordâs approach. Mahoney: [00:11:51] In two ways. One, one of the committees that I only observed and read their report produced a faculty governance structure that we still use, and [two] SES recommendations from several of the committees became the agenda of the standing committees of the faculty when they started to meetâthe Committee on Undergraduate Studies, the Committee on Admission and Financial Aidâand, indeed, some of the members of each of those SES committees wound up being the chair or the member of those new Senate committees. So there was real continuity out of SES into the faculty governance structure along several lines, certainly Admission and Financial Aid, Undergraduate Studies, which was a new office and a new committee. The report on graduate education didnât have the heft it needed to have. There was extracted from it by Alberta Siegel, who was a professor of psychology in the Department of Psychiatry in the School of Medicineâshe was an Advisory Board member; she was a very influential woman faculty memberâshe extracted a piece that became a separate monograph, which was about women graduate students, their paltry numbers, what services they did or didnât have, how they were treated in departments, what the issues were going forward that the university really needed to attend to. All of that resulted inâit must have been Lincoln Moses as dean replacing the English professor who had been graduate dean for many years. 60 There was another study of graduate education that produced much more focused recommendations two or three years later, but there is no question but that SES gave us a structure for faculty governance and gave committees having to do with undergraduatesâincluding Overseas Studies was another one of thoseâtheir agenda going forward and their personnel in the first few years of transition. So I think SES, from the point of view of undergraduate education, was pretty powerful, and it did not have the shortcomings of the typical study where people are thanked for their participation and their report filed away, so I think. And also the case that in Bob Wert, [a Vice-Provost for Undergraduate Education at the time] who left the university to president of Mills College, but he was concerned with undergraduate education [and the new deanship]; Joel Smith passing that baton forward; the replacement of Rick Snyder with Fred Hargadon, all of those responded at the staffing level to the recommendations of SES. Tracy: Interesting. Mahoney: [00:15:39] So, yes, I think it was pretty powerful. Tracy: Did SES formalize a level of faculty involvement in concerns about undergraduate education that already existed, or did it create new sites of faculty involvement, or neither or both? Mahoney: [00:16:03] As the faculty grew with far more high-powered scholars, researchers, with a need to mentor graduate students, I think the concern was that the faculty who had preceded that growth, who had been very focused on undergraduate education, would still continue that, but that the new 61 people wouldnât be drawn into it. So the committee structures that had existed were more refined coming out of SES, and so there came to be real faculty venues at the committee level and then at the policy level with Senate decisions with respect to their recommendations that focused on. When you think of the number of committees that by the seventies were reporting to the Senate, a substantial portion of them were undergraduate Senate committees. There was the Committee on Research and there was the Committee on Graduate Studies, but still. And then there came to be the equivalent later of the Committee on Professoriate, which was very important as we moved along. That came in Bill Millerâs provostship. Tracy: When you think back on your time in dean of students, what did you gain from it and how did it benefit you then moving forward to the other positions that you assumed? Mahoney: [00:18:24] In part because of Joel Smithâs encouragement and my kind of staffing outreach to a variety of things, I became much more aware of the university as an organization and appreciative of its interdependent parts, and I came to have an ease about picking up the phone and calling people. That was enormously helpful. And I learned how to say no gracefully. Joel Smith left to become president at Dennison in Ohio, and he had been an undergraduate at Oberlin. He was replaced, and it was interesting, the replacement was a faculty member from engineering, mechanical engineering, design division, Peter Buckley, who didnât stay very long and who went to Bradley University also in the Midwest. Peter had a heart in the 62 right place, but not very good sense of students who werenât engineers, and I donât think an appreciation of faculty who werenât engineers. He would have proposals that seemed off the wall. By that time, we were having protests, and we had a sit-in in the Old Union before Joel left, because I remember one of the things we learned from that was to turn off the capacity of those phones to engage in longdistance calls if a sit-in occurred, because people used those phones to make long-distance calls to their mothers, their grandmothers, all sorts of people. So one of the little procedures we learned from that event was turn off the phones. Tracy: Thatâs funny. Mahoney: [00:21:18] And around the country, people were learning the same things. But the war was an issue, and it became more and more of an issue, and we had the takeover of the Engineering Building where H. Bruce Franklin, professor of English, was involved. And Peterâif Iâve told you this, stop me. Peter, for all his good intentions, wanted us to sit down and talk about where were these kids and what were we not paying attention to, and his idea about how to do that was to give us cameras and take us out to White Plaza. This was nuts. And I think a variety of people I knew in the university knew that I wasnât enamored of this. And so then Dick Lyman appeared and I went to the Provostâs Office to do whatever the provost told me to do half-time, and to do summer session the other half-time. 63 Tracy: So letâs go ahead and then shift over to your time in the Provostâs Office. We talked a little bit last time about your time overseeing the summer session, and it sounds like even with the dean of students it was another good lesson in sort ofâ Mahoney: [00:22:58] Oh, it was. It gave me a pot of money to spend with the associate deans in four schools who had summer session programs and with the Student Affairs people, and it gave me a basis for sitting down with the people who were trying to make money, the conference program, and say, âThatâs really OK. You can make money as long as we have enough space to house students. They come first.â And I got more involved with the Controllerâs Office in finance, because I had a budget. I remember the controller once complaining to Dick Lyman that I had allowed people to register without paying, and it had been a 300 percent increase in deadbeats since the prior summer when I wasnât in charge, when Ray was in charge. And I pondered that and I looked into it, and I came back and I said at a meeting where both Dick and Ken Creighton [Kenneth Creighton], the then-controller was, that it was true it was 300 percent. It was $900 to $2,700, and since we were talking about several million, I thought it was important to try to get every penny we could, but I hoped I could be forgiven if I didnât think it was the most important thing that I needed to worry about. Creighton looked very unhappy, and Dick tried not to laugh. But, you know, the three schools that didnât do summer session, or did it in their own terms, business, which had those huge conferences that made 64 the money, the law school where nothing went on because people had other things to do, and the medical school which had all sorts of things going on, new interns and new residents and everything else, but the four other schools had pretty serious programs. And it gave me an appreciation through the associate deans, who were the finance officers in each of the four schools, how their deans thought about the curriculum, thought about tradeoffs, thought about enrollments. I got lessons in the priorities of the academic side of the institution by working with those four associate deans and an occasional meeting with the deans themselves, and I couldnât have done that without that summer session experience. I remember one day I wanted to do something and I thought it would produce money, but I had no line-item budget for it. I went to Ray to get his advice, and he said, âOh, this is how you do it. Itâs a good idea.â I donât remember what it was. But he said, âYou put it in your budget as expenditure in anticipation of income.â Iâd never heard the phrase. It set me up to do other things. You had to be accountable, but still it gave me a sense of what to do. So I learned a lot from that and it gave me a sense of the appointment process, faculty appointment process, all the things that I otherwise learned how to deal with later. But it was a terrific opportunity, and it was everybody. It was the police, it was the fire department. So I just sort of ran my little place. Ray told me that would be the case, and he was right. So thatâs that story. 65 Tracy: During this timeâand I assume that this would have fallen under your other half-time responsibilities as an assistant provostâyou did a review of the Registrarâs Office. Is that right? Mahoney: [00:27:59] I did that towards the end. There were two things in the Provostâs Office that people hoped the newcomer would take on. One was parking, and I avoided that, and the other was womenâs physical education and the need over time to merge the departments, and I think weâve talked about that. Tracy: You know, I donât know that we actually have. You and I have spoken about that separately, but I donât know that weâve spent much time on it in an interview, and it was something I wanted to cover, so letâs go ahead and talk about that. Mahoney: [00:28:49] That was my first provost staff assignment, and it had been in the portfolio of Howard Brooks [E. Howard Brooks], who had been vice provost on the academic side of things. Howard, a few years later, went off to be provost of the Claremont Colleges and then became president of Scripps College, the womenâs college there. He said, âThe provost and the provost staff and the Advisory Board have all talked about the need to stop making tenure-ladder appointment in womenâs physical education.â There had been one tenure-ladder appointment in what once upon a time must have been menâs physical education, but everybody who had a serious appointment in womenâs P.E. was on faculty. And he said, âThis has to stop. Theyâre not faculty. They donât do research. There is no graduate program. The School of Education has abandoned serial P.E. as a major.â 66 They dropped the baccalaureate. Pamela Strathairnâs [Pamela Lei Strathairn]âs history was the history of P.E. They abandoned the undergraduate program. They abandoned the masterâs program. They abandoned the doctoral program. [telephone interruption] Mahoney: [00:30:38] Three of her degrees were in P.E. from Stanford, and by the time I arrived on the scene, the School of Education had stopped offering those degrees, so there really was no need for a faculty. And Howard said, âIâve been working with them for well over a year, and I canât get them to understand.â That turned out to be the key to my moving forward. I would go and visit Pam Strathairn, who was a remarkable woman, and her faculty, and we would talk about the provostâs view of the department. One afternoon I had an epiphany, and itâs kind of interesting what tracks. In an academic institution, when you deal with people you respect, their response that they donât understand challenges you to make the case better. Iâm sure it was an honest response, but it was really a response that said this canât be happening. It wasnât that they didnât understand; it was they didnât want it to happen. And not understanding came to be their defense. And neither Howard nor Ray could get past that. So I went back one afternoon, and I said, âPam, itâs going to happen, so letâs talk about the alternatives. Do you want them called teaching staff? Thatâs what theyâre going to be. Theyâre going to be like lecturers.â She said, âThey canât be lecturers. They donât lecture.â 67 So we conjured up this set of titles, teaching associate and senior teaching associate, and so thatâs what they were called. Only one of them was still in the tenure ladder. And they were developing dance, and we were putting drama out of business, the speech component of the speech and drama department out of business, which I had nothing to do with. Over time, dance moved into drama. But there was that component. Once we got past the âWe donât understand,â and I remember going down to Howieâs office and saying, âI think Iâve got it.â Because nobody was going to reduce their salaries. They just couldnât be in the tenure ladder, which is not a small thing. And I said, âI think we have a new set of titles.â He looked at me, and I said, âTeaching associate and senior teaching associate. They canât be lecturers,â because thatâs what people had been saying they would be. I said, âI think itâs more important to give way on that title, which is just made up out of whole cloth, than it is to still argue about the tenure ladder. If this is the price of ending the tenure ladder, itâs a small price.â So we took it to Dick, and Dick agreed and it was done. At about the same time, we knew that we were going to have to merge the departments, and it meant Title IX was coming along, had been articulated, but the regs were not yet in place. That took three years, Richard Nixonâs presidency. We had a situation in which womenâs lifeguards in womenâs P.E. got x salary, and male lifeguards in the athletic department got x + y salary. I said Pam, âWeâre not going to reduce those salaries. You have to come up.â 68 And she said, âThen I have to close the pool. I have to reduce the hours by,â I think she said, by a third on the Roble campus. And I said, âOh.â And I went back to the Provostâs Office and I said, âI need more money. Pam will do this. She doesnât begrudge students a proper wage, but she doesnât have any money, so her choices are close the pool and raise the salaries or donât raise the salaries and have pool hours. And the third alternative is to give her enough money to make her pool hours whole.â So we did that. So we began to do things that made them feel valued, and so they gave up their anguish about not being in the tenure ladder, and they began to realize that there would be opportunities for Stanford women in what was going to inevitably happen that they had never been able to persuade anyone to provide. So I think in the end they were very grateful. I think offline I had mentioned to you that I had seen the Stanford magazine article that Gary Cavalli had done about womenâs sports, and it was a good article, but it started where Gary started. And they had done things earlier on. The Stanford Block S Society had always been male. Pam and her colleagues went back over thirty years of women athletes and said, âIf we applied the Block S rules, which of these women would get Block S awards?â And they named them, they had an event, those women came to the event. I knew someone who would have graduated in the middle sixties who came to the event and said that people wept, that they couldnât believe this was happening. 69 So the eventual merger of the two departments was seen by the womenâs department, in the end, as a great opportunity. It took a while and different personnel for men to see that, and the university did a very good job of finding new personnel. Pam took a lot of heat from the womenâs sports organization. Tracy: AIAW? Mahoney: [00:39:07] Correct. Because at their meeting, she announced the withdrawal of Stanford from the organization and our intention to join this merged NCAA. She had people sending her vitriolic messages and shouting at her. Andy Geiger, who by then was A.D., and he had been preceded by Joe Ruetz [Joseph Hubert Ruetz], an old Notre Dame football player who had been a Stanford development officer, but really cared about these things and he knew how to deal with the Buck Club people, the men who gave money to the menâs department. Tracy: The boosters, yes. Mahoney: [00:0:02] The boosters. He knew how to deal with things that nobody else would have, and so he worked. Pam had very high regard for him, and so she and the department were ready when NCAA said, âThe time has come.â Geiger, it was his vote. He represented Stanford, and he stood up and said, âThis vote will be cast by Pam.â And she was honored. It was the right thing to do, but in that environmentâI wasnât there, but in that environment it would have been quite unusual. So that was my little contribution to the activity. 70 Tracy: Do you have any memory, besides sort of the initial groundwork that you had laid by getting more funds so they could staff it, comparable wage levels, even though you wouldnât necessarily have been that involved per se, did you have a sense that more monies needed to go into athletics as a whole to sort of properly merge womenâs athletics and menâs? Mahoney: [00:41:24] I was on the search committee that brought in Geiger to Stanford. I was the provostâs representative. So was Pat Devaney [Patricia L. Devaney] on that committee, and she was on the committee because she understood athletics through her father, who was the very famous Devaney at Nebraska. Heâd been football coach and then A.D. In fact, he came out and talked to us. When Al Hastorf was on that committee, it was chaired by an alumnus who had been head of the Stanford Booster Club or the Stanford something, Frank Lodado, who later was a trustee, or maybe he was then a trustee. We had no candidates, we only had consultants, because athletics is all about loyalty and the opposite is treachery, so if you go and you talk to somebody about a job, thatâs treachery. It was very strange. So we only had consultants. And people made absolutely clear that if word got out that they were a candidate, they would immediately withdraw. So Lodado was doing preliminary interviews with people in bars and airports. Tracy: It had to be that secretive? Mahoney: [00:42:52] It was very strange. I mean, I had never encountered anything like this. Geiger walked in, and Al Hastorf always asked the first question of all the consultants we had, and it was, âWhat is your philosophy of athletics?â 71 We had heard some very strange responses to that, including from a man who later became head of the NCAA. And Geiger said, âAthletics for all paid for by football,â one sentence. And I said to myself, âI donât know what following up on his references or anything else will establish, but we have a viable candidate in the room.â Heâd not been a major sport athlete as an undergraduate. He had been, I think, a rower at Brown. [Tracy laughs.] But he had very good A.D. experience. He came to us from Penn, and whatâs important about Penn is that the professional football team in Philadelphia plays in the Penn stadium, so he knew not only college athleticsâand he was also on the NCAA Television Rights Committee. Tracy: Which was a veryâat least what would have been at that time a really important committee to be on. Mahoney: [00:44:35] Yes, and it would be to this day. Tracy: Yes. Mahoney: [00:44:38] So he knew the professional side, he knew the money side from the stadium as well as his own program, and he knew that big picture of how individual schools make money off the media, etc. He had a very nice touch. He was willing to say, âIf you want to tell people Iâm a candidate, itâs all right.â He just had a different view entirely. He and his wife moved into a resident fellowâs cottage up on a lake, so that they lived with students as well as he headed the department. And he meant athletics were for all paid for by football, so he spent a lot of time saying to Pam, âWhat maintenance does your facility need? Are we paying 72 the staff?â I had tried to look; he immediately looked at salary equity. He immediately looked at why do menâforget football for a moment, but why do men in volleyball or basketball have better trainers than the women have. And, yes, we all knew that those things would cost us money, but he also knew how to get it done and he also knew how to handle money. So I didnât pay much attention to his department and its money after these other things were done; Ray did more of that on the budget side. But he was a gift to us in bringing things together and showing respect to people who had been around a long time without at all saying things have to be the same as they were. They donât. And he took on fundraising and the Buck Club and all those things in a very orderly way. So that was a good thing. Tracy: Interesting. Anything else in terms of the work that youâve done with us, athletics, as a provost? Mahoney: [00:47:39] No. Tracy: Assistant provost? Mahoney: [00:47:40] My next career spent some time doing something would have been the Committee on Professoriate and then later what the Registrarâs Office needed in a registrar. Tracy: Was there anything significant that came out of your work on the Committee on the Professoriate? Mahoney: [00:48:10] Wow. [Tracy laughs.] I learned a lot. One of the things I learned from Bill Miller was keep it simple, have some small number of principles, and make sure that you apply them consistently and call on them when 73 youâre making decisions. In particular, women who were not on the faculty who were research associates and lecturers, but particularly in the sciences where they were research associates, wanted to be principal investigators [PIâs]. The general rule was subject to exception, but the general rule was only faculty will be principal investigators. So part of the issue on the Committee on the Professoriate was who was a faculty member, and into the middle of all this came these women who were claiming discrimination because they werenât allowed to be principal investigators, and faculty colleagues saying to the deans and the provost, âLook, these women have conceived these hypotheses and these research protocols. They are not ancillary to things that we do, and they should be recognized. They should take responsibility for the funding that comes in. So you need to make these research associatesâ.â Maybe alsoâI canât remember whether we also had the title senior research associates. âGive them faculty privileges with respect to being P.I.âs.â The Bill Miller principle that Colin Pittendrigh, who chaired that committee, espoused was, âNo. If you do that, youâre a faculty member and you should have a faculty title.â So Bill asked for a review of every woman in those lines--who should be brought into the faculty? I remember a woman in the medical school, who shortly after being made a full professor died of a brain tumor. I canât remember her name. But people were stunned, because what they werenât pushing to have faculty titles; they were pushing to have faculty privileges. And Miller and then the Committee on the Professoriate, which I staffed for Miller with the 74 assistance of my assistant, Susan Horst, said, âNo. If theyâre faculty members, we ought to call them faculty members.â And thatâs what happened. Tracy: Thatâs interesting. Mahoney: [00:51:59] But what I took out of that was keep it simple. All around the country, research people were getting faculty privileges, and then did they have tenure, did they not have tenure? All that stuff. Bill and Pittendrigh and the Committee on the Professoriate found a path through that and then a review that took seriously everybody whose complaint ought to be taken seriously. Weâd already, on the non-science, non-engineering side run into the obstacle of the woman lecturer whoâs a lecturer because her spouse was a faculty member. In Dick Lymanâs period as provost, he got an angry letter from a faculty member in medicine who said, âMy colleagues have just done a national search, and they have come up with a stellar candidate that we find we canât appoint because sheâs my wife. There is something wrong with this.â Lyman put Lowell Price on that little investigation, and Lowell went through history and found two things. One, it had never been written down as a policy; it was custom. And, two, it had been breached once when Professor FlÃ¼gge and Professor FlÃ¼gge-Lotz in Aeronautics and Astronautics were together in the department, she with the lower title. The German scientific community and the German government were about to give her some really important prize, and it was unthinkable that she go to Germany to collect this prize if she were not a professor, you know, Herr Doktor Professor, that 75 culture, and she wasnât. So Fred Terman had said, âWe will make an exception to our understanding about nepotism for this woman, and if the same thing ever happens again, weâll do it again, but otherwise the answerâs no.â So, FlÃ¼gge and FlÃ¼gge-Lotz. He was still around when I was first in the Provostâs Office. Maybe she was. I just donât know. But what Lyman found out was we had no written policy and weâd had an exception, and so he took advantage of that. Then as he became president and the Committee on the Professoriate came along with Miller, a serious review of women in the Humanities was done, who had been lecturers: Barbara Gelpi, somebody else in English. People looked atâoh, Herb Packerâs wife. Tracy: Nancy. Mahoney: [00:55:51] Nancy. Though that wasnât [departmental] nepotism, but that was, âShe can be a lecturer,â kind of thing. And people kept saying, âWell, if she will have to direct the program, then we really canât have a lecturer directing the program,â so they rethought that. But those things happened in that period of time, and I came away with a very strong sense that I used when I went to Agnes Scott, which was having a different state of affairs, but I would articulate these principles I had learned at Stanford: keep it simple, and then when issues arise, judge people vis-Ã -vis the standards you have for whatever your principles tell you where the standards are. So it was a very useful time. Then along came the registrar was approaching retirement. He said to Bill, âYou know, Iâm going to be sixty-five.â He had a campus home on 76 Foothill, and he moved to the rentals on Sand Hill Road, Oak Creek, because there were no condominiums yet, and when they were built, he moved into those. But he said, âYou need to think about the future.â So Bill came to me, and I did what became my pattern over time, looking at a situation, researching it, and doing a white paper. Thatâs what I had done in the Dean of Studentâs Office, at Cowell Student Health Service, or the Counseling Center. Thatâs what I basically did with womenâs physical education, kind of get it all together, think about it, because one of the rules I learned from Bill is you bring your bosses a solution, not a problem. If you have a proposed solution, make a recommendation, because the last thing your boss wants from your hard work is another problem. [Tracy laughs.] So I looked into what the Registrarâs Office was, what the deans wanted in the registrar, where it was going to go over the next few years, and I did a white paper, and one of the things I said was that computing was going to be much more an issue for the office and for the university. Bill didnât need to be told that; he was a computer scientist. Harvey Hall had the highest regard from faculty as a person of integrity. I learned by looking at the office that that job, although in terms of volume of activity, it dealt with students, but it was really a Facultyâs Services Office. The registrar needed to be able to assure the faculty that their policies as regards to students were being followed and that exceptions were not sort of willy-nilly and that exceptions that were serious should be brought to the Faculty Committee and etc. 77 So I did a white paper, and the next thing that happened was Bill said, âI think we should go with this.â And I had also said, not in writing, but I had said to Bill that I knew that Harvey wanted his associate registrar to have a shot at the job and wanted him to have it. He was a Stanford alum who had a Harvard MBA, and in terms of the old office was a really fine person, but I didnât think could do the big-picture job. So Bill put together a search committee chaired by Fred Crawford [Frederic Crawford] in electrical engineering, and the usual array of people, students and someone from computing. I was Billâs representative to the committee and I got someone to staff it. We had people come in from all over the country. We did interview Bob, as I remember, and we gave Bill our first choice and two others. He took about a week, and he called me and Fred into his office. Tracy: Fred? Fred Hargadon? Mahoney: [01:01:42] No, Fred Crawford, the professor of electrical engineering, Dean of Research. All this year, Harvey had [been] retired, so Bob had been in charge, and Bill was sad to tell us, that our search had not yielded a registrar. He didnât find our A-1 candidate or the other two appointable. I looked at Fred, and we asked about why. He told us why, and I had to confess that I didnât disagree. So I guess I said, âWell, weâre going to have to do a different kind of search with a different set of emphases, but weâre going to need to take a little bit of time to do it, because weâve fished in the pond, and so we canât just reopen the search and get the same people to apply.â 78 So we waited for a while, and then nothing happened, nothing happened, nothing happened. And we were headed for summer into fall, and I went to Bill one day and I said, âBill, we canât ask Bob Houghton [Robert Douglas Houghton] to do this job a second year and not give it to him, and you and I know and Fred knows that he shouldnât do it, but this is unfair.â He looked at me, smiling, and said, âI have a solution.â And I said, âWell, then, for goodness sake, execute it.â [Tracy laughs.] And he said, âYouâll do it.â And my first answer was, âI will not.â So we talked a while, and we agreed that I would stay in the Provostâs Office and do the Registrarâs Office not exactly half-time, but I would do the Registrarâs Office, and I would do stuff in the Provostâs Office, so thatâs what happened. Thatâs how I got there. I said I wouldnât do it. In addition to having simple principles about topics people think are just so complicated that they have to have complicated solutions, Billâs other great skill was to identify people who could do certain jobs. Chuck Dickens [Charles Dickens] he had made head of IT, but after a while administrative computing and all this kind of stuff was not what Chuck wanted to do, and so Bill sat with him and realized that where Chuck wanted to go was where the faculty were doing something exciting, where computing was going to be the tool they were using without which they couldnât do their research. So Bill said, âYou donât have to be head of IT anymore,â made some other choice there, and sent him over to SLAC to work with the faculty at SLAC. 79 And within nine months, they had found a new element, and Chuck felt deeply invested in having helped with that. So that makes a match. I worked. Suddenly I wasnât just staffing committees, but I was the ex-officio member of what was then called CAAA, the Committee on Academic Achievement and Appraisal. I had a different set of relationships with the faculty. I was an ex-officio member, as was Fred Hargadon and Jim Lyons, of the [Academic Council, and I did that for twenty years. The computing thing, Stanfordâs administrative computing was supported by something called OASIS, the first word of which is Online. It was a software designed by a group of guys who ate hamburgers at the Oasis on El Camino in Menlo Park. So thatâs why OASIS. They created an acronym. Tracy: [laughs] Thatâs funny. Mahoney: [01:06:54] OASIS was very expensive in machine overhead. It was very, very complicated to use, but it had a remarkable query capability. If you wanted to array football players by academic major and graduation awards, you could do that. Some people loved it, but maintaining it, it was a mess. The year I arrived, somebodyâand I came to realize this was the kind of reason that Bill asked me to do the job. There was a guy named Epstein who had something to do with SPIRES. SPIRES was our library computational software, because Stanford always did its own internal software. They showed up to tell me how they were going to help me out of OASIS and into SPIRES, and they worked for, oh, maybe the better part of a 80 year. But in the first maybe three months, this guy and Mike Roberts and a group of people would come to my office and tell me where they were. Chuck Dickens didnât. My eyes would glaze over. I had no idea what they were talking about. Finally one dayâand it was sheer frustrationâChuck wasnât there, but Mike was. Mike was a talented administrator. And I finally said to this guy [Epstein]âwe were talking about I/Os and CPUsââI have no idea what youâre talking about. The only language you and I have in common is English, so let me suggest that you stop talking your talk and start talking the language we have in common. So what are you talking about?â Mike laughed, and this guy looked aghast, and I said, âWe donât have to keep talking now, but can you come back and tell me what I need to know in English?â So we broke up the meeting, and they came back a week later. In between, I gather Roberts and Dickens had gone to see Bill, filled with, âShe can take charge.â I mean, it was simple frustration on my part. I wasnât even polite. I just said, âI canât do this anymore.â All I knew, I was paying for it. Whatever it was they were talking about, I was paying for it. So the next week they came, and they told me that I/Os and CPUs were like feet and inches, they were units of measurement, and thatâs what I was paying for, and OASIS used too much of them and SPIRES was going to be better. Well, I understood that. These people were going to work with the staff to make the transition. After about four or five months, I came to the realization that I tried out first 81 on Mike Roberts. I said, âI donât think these guys can do this. I donât think the software,â I learned a word, âis robust enough to handle it.â And he looked at me like, âYouâre acquiring a vocabulary.â And I said, âThe way I think about it is that student recordsâand this will also be true of developmentâs recordsâare, relatively speaking in the swath of things, a relatively small number of records, but highly complicated.â At the front end is admission, thereâs demographic data, thereâs curricular data. In order that you have curricular data linked to the student, you have to have a database of the curriculum, you know, all these kinds of things.â So records are very complicated and highly interdependent, and the people who use them have to be able to maintain their complexity. So thatâs (a). Then, (b), SPIRES is a vast number of records. I donât know how many books we had in the library or might have twenty-five years from now, but no one record has very many items in it, you know, author, publisher, date of publication, maybe various data about topics and subtopics and maybe a reach to other works by the same author, I mean, but itâs not complicated. So I think these people are trying to impose this. The next thing that happensâno one thinks this is very funnyâis that we were doing downsizing. Chuck Dickens comes to me with Roberts, not with this technical guy, and he said, âWe just canât keep OASIS going. We donât want to have to administer it. Weâve got some stability in development and we know how to handle that for a while.â He said, âI want to make a transfer of an applications and operations group to you. You will be their 82 boss. You will have the money that supports them, and the quid pro quo is that you will not make any major improvements to the system, but you will keep it going long enough so that they and your people know how to maintain a system so that when we come up with a better solution, whether itâs SPIRES or something else, you will be ready.â I said, âSure.â I didnât even know what it meant, but I said, âSure.â So I went down to Miller and I said, âThis is the deal, and I think I should say yes.â And he said, âOh, yes, so do I.â [Tracy laughs.] So we had seven years of maintaining an old system. Now, we made improvements to it that both the technical people and the staff loved, but told nobody about because my deal was no improvements, but weâd get things to work better. And in the meantime, the controller doesnât want to throw out his old batch systems that are falling apart and are the reason we got into the indirect cost recovery problem. But Iâm working away. I produce from the staffâI mean, I had this man who is our leader of software and this woman who is the leader of operations, which means she schedules things, and then a new assistant registrar who knows what they do, because I sure donât, and weâve gotten her from development, so she knows whatâs going on. And one day I agree that faculty should input grade data on those things. Tracy: Like those Scantron tests? 83 Mahoney: [01:16:13] Right. The classics department thinks I have given them a gift beyond their wildest dreams, and I am visited by four chairs from engineering, who say, âThis is old technology. Why are you using it?â And I say, âIâm using it because I can buy a scanner and put it in the room across the hall because right now what happens is we take all of the grades labeled A, B, whatever they are, and we send these raw documents to San Jose to be input by an input house. If the truck carrying them ever was in an accident and burned up, we would have nothing.â They went away, just beside themselves that we were so backwards, but at least they had a reason. So we did that for a couple more years, and by this time the staff knew what it was doing. I was about to leave, but it was they knew how to maintain a system, they knew how to do checks by sampling, and we had begun to use, five, six years earlier, the data base in ways that Herant Katchadourian and I made common cause with. I was able to provide the Committee on Graduate Studies and Undergraduate Studies data for their use, but it was because I had taken on this thing that was an orphan that nobody else wanted, but where people who looked at it really knew they needed to keep for a while. So that brought the Registrarâs Office into the twentieth century, if not beyond, and it allowed us to say that we could use these data for university decision-making of the sort that Herant thought was so important, and so thatâs what we did. Tracy: Can you talk just a little bit more aboutâbecause itâs certainly significant in terms of the Registrarâs Office, but very significant in terms of Herantâs 84 careerâthe sort of studies that you were doing, the information that you were using? Mahoney: [01:19:10] In the old days, the Registrarâs Office produced for Fred Terman, using batch systems and then I donât know what they used in that sort of transition period, but this great big computer output report that identified every course in the curriculum and identified aliases for the name of that course if they were cross-listed so that Terman could see how large the enrollments were. And we kept doing that, and people then gave this report to their own people to try and make sense out of their own subsections of it, H&S or whatever. I remember the first year I was registrar, the phone rang and this voice appeared and it was Fred Terman, who said, âThank you for producing the report on time.â I didnât know whether it was early or late. âAnd I have some suggestions if you can ever make that computer to work.â I said, âOh, OK.â [Tracy laughs.] And I said, âWhy donât you write me a quick note that tells me the topics you want improved.â And he did, and one of them was, âIâd really like to know the majors of students who are taking these courses.â So when Herant began to look at these dataâand I have a couple of those books somewhere in the backâHerant got exactly interested in the same thing. So we designed a format. He had worked with a woman named Sally Cole, who had been in the Dean of Students Office, and then with John Boli, to define what it was they needed. By this time I had an institutional research person, a fellow from Kerala, India, who could do things. 85 So Herant and I designed something, and basically what it did was say this is the gross data for all majors [across the University], this is the gross data by school, for example, H&S, and so English majors or French majors or whatever, and it always compared a departmentâs data with the school and with the group as a whole. Each report was about a different program, and there were pages and pages of them, but you could find things. You could, for example, discover that a number of enrollments in art history and in some courses in art were taken by mechanical engineers in higher proportions than would otherwise be random. And then when you looked at art majors, not art history majors but art majors, more of them were taking mechanical engineering design courses than was just random. So Herant could go to chairs and say, âDo you know that you have these cross-cutting constituencies, and have you ever talked to one another?â you know, which people thought was an interesting idea. Again and again we found overlaps. Biology majors, even Hum Bio majors, taking courses in the School of Medicine. Not so odd, but almost nobody knew that undergraduates took courses in the School of Medicine. Herant was not somebody who once you had a paradigm kept changing it, which is make-work for the poor souls who have to do it, but also it doesnât get you comparable data if you want to compare it over time. So whatever the warts are, we might have tweaked it a little bit, but whatever the warts were, they were what they were, but we could make and he could make judgments that the Committee on Undergraduate Studies could pay attention to, that other groups could pay attention to. 86 We could pull in data, not [just] from these reports, but from other data. We didnât really know which of our students went to graduate school. In fact, we didnât know which of our students took the GREs or the LSATs or the whatever. Well, if you knew that, you could know what majors were producing what kinds of professional study, those kinds of things. So people began to say, âOh, we can ask about that.â So we began to getâand our [Registrarâs Office] institutional research person--based on people having looked and asked questions about the stable reports, he would get questions from departments. If departments were having a five-year review or a school was having a specialized accreditation, they could use this. So it meant a lot to Herant, but it also meant a lot to individual schools and departments, and it meant that those schools and departments looked to the Registrarâs Office to give them new insights. The odd thing was that that database, which one of the sub-databases of the student file was always the curriculum, you know, courses and degrees and the time schedule, and you couldnât have done this report without that database. It came to have where did the course meet kind of data, at a time when classroomsâthis is the mid-eighties; Don Kennedy [Donald Kennedy] is presidentâwhen classrooms were a forgotten item on the landscape of maintenance. We were all concerned about money and classroom maintenance. One day Bill Clebsch in religious studies saw Don Kennedy walking across Quad and called him back to Building 50 or 60, somewhere on one side of the church or another, where there was a small classroom, probably a 87 lecture room of forty or fifty people, and he said to Don, âLook at this room. Students bring clipboards to this room, because the wire in the upholstered seats is coming through the upholstery, and people sit on clipboards so as not to be impaled.â Kennedy, I think, probably went to Rosseâ Tracy: Jim Rosse? Mahoney: [01:28:31] Right. Who came to me and said, âWhat do you know about classrooms?â And I said, âI know that people complain about them and that there are some rooms that youâd better put a really junior person in because nobody else will put up with it, but I donât otherwise know anything about classrooms.â So we put a lot of pressure on business and finance facilities people. Iâd go to these meetings, and business and finance visited me and they said, âYou hold the database on classrooms.â And I said, âYes.â And they said, âWell, you know, we donât know much about classrooms other than when people call us up to complain. We donât really use your database.â They didnât say, âWe donât want to use your database,â which was more the truth. âHow about if we give you the maintenance budget for classrooms, and then you can maintain classrooms.â Tracy: Did a maintenance budget for classrooms exist? [laughs] Mahoney: [01:29:48] Well, that was news to me, and, again, it was just like taking on the computer people. I said, âYes.â 88 I came back to the office, told people what I had done, and Gloria Gearing, who knew a lot about a lot of things, was assistant registrar, and knew about courses and degrees and that part of the database. She said, âWe canât let you go to meetings because you come back with some whole other task.â [Tracy laughs.] And I said, âWell, itâs a task that will have personnel and money.â So I call this guy who has made this offer, and I say, âCould you tell me what the maintenance budget is for classroom?â And he says, cheerfully, âFifty thousand dollars.â Now, that wouldnât paint two walls in Cubberley Auditorium. So I go down to Rosse and Kennedy and I say, âIâm taking over classrooms.â And Don says, âThis is good.â I say, âIâm also taking on a maintenance budget. Weâre in the middle of downsizing again, but Iâve got to tell you, Iâm coming to you for money, and weâre going to do the absolutely worst ones first, and then weâre going to make a plan forâ.â Tracy: Ongoing. Mahoney: [01:31:19] âAnd in that process, weâre going to see if we canât build a base budget for classroom maintenance.â Don asked the same question I had asked, âHow much is the budget?â And I said, âFifty thousand dollars.â And those two men just laughed and laughed. I mean, I didnât think it was funny. [Tracy laughs.] But looked at from the point of view of the square footage, it was laughable. 89 So they gave me $250,000 worth of one-time money for that first summer, and we acted quickly and we did Cubberley Auditorium and we did that building that Clebsch had a concern about, because, after all, he got credit because he had really forced the issue, and then we did what we could do, and we made a lot of people happy. But we did it because everybody initially realized we could track classrooms in ways that business and finance couldnât and didnât want to. I mean, it was a real orphan. So I would take things on this way, and then in the meantime I would do provost staff stuff as relief from doing all these things. Tracy: Not to get you off track, but just because I was curious, at what point in this evolutionâthis, Iâm thinking would be earlier, but when did you become the Title IX officer and what period of time did that sort of cover? Mahoney: [01:33:04] Well, Title IX came around in â72, and the regs were out in â75. Somewhere in that window Dick and Bill asked me if I would do an assessment of our Title IX liabilities, and I said, âSure.â Didnât seem like much of a deal. And they said, âYou should work with Jim Siena, who was then general counsel to the university, and Iris Brest, who was a managing attorney and knew all about civil rights things because she and Paul [Brest] had been in Mississippi and had known what things the Office of Civil Rights looked for when you do those kinds of assessments. She told me to count bathrooms. And I said, âNot really?â And she said, âOh, yes, really.â 90 So I did a kind of preliminary assessment. It was clear that we had residual problem of the Stanford 500 that had been honored in the breach since the thirties, but as our graduate student body increased in size, that whole thing that was about, you know, we can do this in spirit, because there were so few graduate women that we can let the undergraduate student body grow in size wasnât going to cut it. So that was an issue. Mahoney: [01:35:06] There was the issue that really at the behest of women students who were member of sororities towards the close of the Second World War, the university had banned sororities at the request of the women themselves, but we had continued with fraternities, and that was an issue. So those were the two big issues. There probably were pay and equity issues at the staff level, so there was a Personnel Policy Committee established when Rob Parker was director of personnel. Then it turns out that bathrooms were an interesting subject, specifically at Cubberley, where we had some women faculty. The faculty restroom was a menâs restroom that had been breached by Elizabeth Cohen, but there really werenât any arrangements made. So, by and large, women faculty at Cubberley, who used Cubberley, used the womenâs public restroom on the first floor, despite the fact that there was a faculty lounge upstairs, I think on the third floor, that had a menâs restroom. So that kind of thing had to get changed. My name as Title IX officer went into courses and degrees, in the information section of policies and who you can complain to and all that kind of thing. One afternoon, a man I would judge was in his forties, walked 91 into my office and said he was a student in the business school and asked me if I had ever been in an institution governed by a federal consent decree, and I said, âNo.â And he said, âYouâre running the risk of that happening,â which perked me up. And he said that this was a time at whichâand it was early, it was late seventies, early eighties, when there were a couple of women assistant professors in the business school. It was not only faculty who had reservations about women professors in the business school, it was also business school students who thought, some of them, that were it known that some of their courses had been taught by women, their degrees would be demeaned. A greater piece of nonsense I couldnât imagine. Arjay Miller was the dean, and Rob Jaedicke [Robert K. Jaedicke] was the associate dean, and they certainly didnât hold these views. They gave great support to the women, including Myra Strober, who was one of those women. And this man said to me, âYou know, itâs subtle and ugly at the same time.â He said, âThe deans take student evaluation of teaching effectiveness very, very seriously, so people who get bad reviews donât get reappointed.â And he said, âThere are messages in the menâs bathroom in Arbuckle,â which was in the basement of the business school just off a student area, âthat basically say you should pay attention to the reviews you give those women professors.â And he said, âMost people pay no attention and go in and out because theyâre just doing their business, but itâs a messaging system that you might be troubled by.â 92 And I said, âThank you. I will see that itâs looked into.â I had the wit not to say, âI will look into it.â I remember that. I picked up the phone and I called Bob Jaedicke, the associate dean, and I told him the story, and he said, âThereâs a faculty bathroom, so nobody goes down there.â And I said, âWell, can I ask you to pay it a visit?â And he did, and he phoned me back and he said, âThe gentleman who visited you was right to be concerned. Iâm sorry he didnât come to me or the dean, but Iâm grateful for your message, and this will be taken care of.â So they spent some time working on it, and I have every reason to thinkâI never saw that man again. But it was an interestingâI mean, Iris was right to say, âPay attention to bathrooms,â which had never occurred to me. The university wasnât in any trouble over this, but over time those notions got paid attention to. When we renovated the stadium, there are now more womenâs restrooms in the stadium than there used to be, and the reason is not simply that there were too few; itâs the timing principle. You need more for the same numbers, because women spend more time in stalls than men. So that was the story. Tracy: I may be misunderstanding this, but did you deal with anyâit seems that sexual harassment policies came up during that time. Mahoney: [01:41:45] Well, certainly a big one came up. By and large, the schools were good about taking care of them, and I donât remember staff harassment issues, but by the time Amy Blue got over to business and finance, they 93 would have been paid attention to, but also I credit business and finance as paying attention to those issues, both before Bill Massy was business vice president, during, and after. So I donât remember those coming up, but I do remember the school issues and I remember that the key people in helping schools deal with them were Leah Kaplan, the universityâs ombudsperson, who was the wife, then widow of Henry Kaplan in radiology, and Alberta E. Siegel in the medical school, and also Eleanor Maccoby [Eleanor E Maccoby], who I think is still alive, living at Vi. So there was a network of people who paid attention in the schools, but sometimes you heardâI would hear from Alberta about stories that I took cognizance of but didnât get involved in, a case of an infuriated human biology student who was going to have some kind of undergraduate research assistantship with somebody in the medical school, and he propositioned her in some fashion, which she rejected. And she was furious, and she went into that cafeteria in the Medical Center and, by happenstance, sat down next to a graduate studentâI donât think a medical student, I think in one of the disciplines of medicine, of the medical school, and spouted about having been propositioned. And the women she was venting on said, âOh, I know him. He did that to me too.â And this young woman said, âWe will take care of this. We will go see my freshman advisor.â And this graduate woman thought she was witless. Well, her freshman advisor was Don Kennedy. [Tracy laughs.] So they went over to Building 10, and the dean put together an investigation, and Alberta was involved in that investigation, which proved to be quite true, and 94 it needed in its outcome to go to the Advisory Board because any punitive reduction in pay or statusâand I think this was a reduction in pay, temporary reduction in payâhas to go to the Advisory Board for vetting. Alberta said that people in the department, when she, at the deanâs behest, was doing this investigation, she said people said to her, âThis canât be true. He has such a nice wife and some nice kids.â And Alberta said to me, âThat is not what this is about. We donât need to make this part of the family, but we need to take care of it.â So my sense was that the issue was there, but the schools did a better job of it with the help of Kaplan and Siegel especially, and maybe others. The real issue was getting women into the faculty, and what Miller had done earlier helped that, but somebody like Elisabeth Pate-Cornell was a lone ranger for a very long time in engineering. And, of course, departments like political science were notorious. That department whenâand it must have been â79, so it was post-Title IX, didnât have a single woman or a single person of color in it. And both Lyman and Miller put a lot of pressure on Alex George [Alexander L. George], who was the chair of poli-sci, which was one of the two or three largest undergraduate major programs in the university: biology, human biology, poli-sci, and history. Engineering clustered together was bigger, but no one engineering [discipline]. Alex George was, that year, president of the American Political Science Association, and Lyman and Miller both said to him, âYour association is a place that young PhD got to get jobs. Thereâs a network operating there. We will not take it kindly if you come back with no prospects.â 95 And at that time there was affirmative action money. Miller had put an affirmative action fund together. I didnât have the affirmative action fund, but for some reason, George came to see me to report what he was about to report to Miller, and it was that he had found a woman who was an expert in Soviet military history, and if you put her behind a screen and had her speak Russian, you would think she was a native speaker. And he said to me, âDo you think I can get affirmative action money out of Miller for that?â And I said, âAbsolutely, provided you can give him one piece of information. That piece of information is when that woman is ready for tenureâthis is mortgage moneyâwhose retirement place will she be taking?â And he looked at me for a long time and he said, âIf you add seven to next year, it will be my place.â I said, âFine. Go and tell your story. That will be welcomed.â And he got to the door, and he turned around and he said to me, âOh, I didnât tell you, sheâs African American.â It was Condi. [01:49:55] The same year by coincidence, the department was bringing Bob Keohane to the department, but he wouldnât come unless his wife could come too. They were recently married. I donât know whether each of them had been divorced and married one another or only one of them, but in any event, they had blended family. He was not about to come unless she had a position, and she was not about to come to a lecturerâs position. But there was no mortgageable place in that department. She took the position, and Bob with herâI had nothing to do with thisâthat by the time she was ready 96 for tenure, she would have been so good at what she did, which is really philosophy of politics, that the university would make a billet for her, and that happened. Both women were tenured, and having been tenured, Condi went off to work in Bush 1 administration and came back, and so I could use her on the Admission Committee. That isnât why she came back, but thatâs what I used. [Tracy laughs.] And Nan [Keohane] was stellar. It must have been Bobâs proposition when she came, that they would make a position for her. It was true. She was chair of the Senate and went off to Wellesley College and then to Duke. Tracy: Yes, that was what I was going to ask you. I couldnât remember where she went. Mahoney: [01:51:51] Right. And I remember when I was in Atlanta, I met, through one of my trustees at some club, a Duke trustee who said to me, âYou know Nan Keohane?â And I said, âSure.â And he said, âDo you know she understands football?â I said, âOh, yes, I do.â [laughter] So, I mean, it was very funny, because by this time she had come to the South, to Duke, which cared little about football, but king at Duke is basketball. So faculties were taking Lyman and Miller and Kennedy and then Hastorf, who became provost after Kennedy, seriously. H&S really worked on having women. Jim Gibbons, I think, needs a lot of credit, because he was aware that Title IX issues had early on to do with how many women 97 undergraduates were there so there could be women graduate students. One of the things Herantâs data and mine produced for Jim was the insightâJohn Boli worked on thisâthat if a man got a B-minus in something, he checked it off, a prerequisite taken care of, go forward. If a woman got a B-plus, she wasnât sure she could be an engineer. And that finding is replicated all over the country. Jim did a very interesting thing. He took a group of freshmen women who were struggling. They were perfectly adequate, but they felt they were struggling. And he wanted them to be successful strugglers, and he got them summer paid internship jobs at places like Bechtel or PG&E, and they went out in the field with hard hats, with people who were engineers, and they met all sorts of people. They met people who climbed telephone poles and who were Hispanic and who said, âOh, it would be wonderful if my daughter could work for Bechtel like you. Youâre an engineer. You have a clipboard and a hard hat.â Thatâs how they knew who the professional engineers were out in the field. Tracy: Thatâs funny. Mahoney: [01:54:51] And that group of womenâthere werenât many of them; maybe there were ten of themâthey came back that fall. And when you talk to women students in science and engineering, usually pre-med and science and then engineers, they would have said in the past, âI am thinking about studying engineering,â or chemistry or biology. That group of women said, âIâm an engineer.â The grade thing was put into context because everybody out in the field thought they were useful, and the people who were not 98 professional engineers were quite certain they were engineers. And they talked about those experiences as being very useful. Gibbons took that to heart and he tried to do other things as well. He tried to get women into the faculty. But those were important things, more important from the point of view of things that I did than harassment. Now, my very last days at Stanford involved me in a sexual harassment policy issue, or sexual harassment charge, which Fran Conley mentions in her book. It was alleged by somebody in radiology which was known as a place where there were issues. Tracy: An aggressive atmosphere? Mahoney: [sentences deleted] There was some complaint made to the dean of medicine, say, in the middle of the week. That same complaint in all its detail appeared in the San Jose Mercury in the Sunday edition on Saturday, arguing, complaining about the harassment of women in radiology. This man [the department chair who was the focus of the allegation] was asked about it the next Friday night when he went to temple, and his kid was asked about it at school. It was terrible. So the dean put together a committee. The committee did an investigation. I was part of the committee. Alberta was part of the committee. There was a group of us. We had a court reporter in the room at all times. We interviewed every tech in the hospital that worked with the department. We worked with everybody in the department. We had something like sixty-three interviews. 99 I came away from that process absolutely convinced that everybody in the department was harassed and that it was an equal opportunity harassment. It wasnât sexual. Women felt harassed especially when you combined their professional work with their family work, but men felt harassed. PhD men in the department felt harassed. It was a place of harassment. But we found no reason to think that this poor new chair of the department was the harasser. We did find reason to believe that there was somebody who didnât like his coming who might have been the source of this, but we didnât get into that, as our charge was merely to find what the story was. So that was my most exciting harassment story. I mean, sixty-three people and a court reporter whose salary just from us must have been in the six figures. They talked with medical terminology that I certainly didnât understand. She would stop them and ask them if they meant this or that. She had a bachelorâs and a masterâs degree in some medical sciences field. But it was taken very seriously. So, no, I think sexual harassment claims have been seriously taken at Stanford. Tracy: Anything else aboutâhow long did you serve as the Title IX officer? Mahoney: [02:00:48] Oh, endlessly, just, like, you know, you just need a name. So anytime somebody would comeâand I guess when I left the university, they got somebody else. But when we took some of these matters to the Board of Trustees, when we took the sorority thing to the Board of Trustees, it got tabled by the board, because the board got enormous amount of pushback from Mrs. 100 Harold Bacon, who had been an assistant dean in 1944 when this happened, when women said no, when people like Sandra Day OâConner, who was then a trustee, said to usâshe wasnât yet a Supreme Court Justice; she was a politician in the Arizona legislatureâshe said, âTitle IX canât possibly mean this.â Turned out one of the trustees who was with the Sierra Club had been one of the very few undergraduate men on campus. I think heâd been 4F, so he couldnât get drafted, and he felt a duty to the women who had worked so hard, to get rid of sororities for good reasonsâthatâs a long storyâthat he didnât feel he could vote for it. It was wild. So we crept back, Don and Jim Lyons and I, and Jim Lyons had lunch with Roz Bacon, who said, âI have a duty to the women who fought so hard against this terrible thing.â Jim did a good job of it, so we went back. The way it got stopped the first time was not that they just wouldnât vote, Robert Minge Brown went out to an outer room and brought back a big legal book, and he opened it and he said, âUntil we check this, we can take no decision.â And I realized he was reading from the book upside down. I mean, it was theater. And I said to someone, I donât know who, âHe was reading from the book upside down.â And whoever it was said to me, âSally, heâs been a trial lawyer. He understands drama.â He needed to get this out of the room, and he did. So then we came back and it wasnât quite the consent calendar, but it got settled, and part of the way it got settled was the women on the board and the man who remembered 1944 abstained, so no women voted for the 101 return of sororities to Stanford. And they were right to say we werenât bringing them a proposal that said we have to have sororities. We said we had to eliminate the prohibition. And they said if we eliminate the prohibition, somebody will want them, and that happened. [End of February 26, 2014 interview with Sally T. Mahoney] 102 STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROJECT: STANFORD STAFF ORAL HISTORY PROJECT INTERVIEWER: ALLISON TRACY INTERVIEWEE: SALLY T. MAHONEY DATE OF INTERVIEW: MARCH 26, 2014 Tracy: Hi. This is Allison Tracy. Itâs March 26, 2014. Iâm here with Sally Mahoney to conclude our oral history interviews for the Stanford Historical Society. Sally, when we had left off, we were talking about your time as registrar. Next for you was your time as acting vice president for student resources. So letâs spend a little bit of time talking about the budget context in which you came into that position. Mahoney: [00:00:35] There were the usual budget issues which had to do with the rate of growth of the budget (a concern in and of itself), also the faculty concerns with the indirect-cost recovery rate, and puzzlement about why the rates of growth were what they were in areas of student support. So that was one piece. We also were dealing with the federal government around the indirectcost recovery controversy and so that was always present. Jim Rosse [James N. Rosse] said to me one day that he was thinking of a reorganization. Since I had always balanced being registrar on one hand with being a provost staff person on the other, I knew that these conversations had been going on. He said he wanted to think about an organization he called âstudent resourcesâ which would have a vice 103 president; he wanted me to take it on and see if it could be made to work. So that got me to that role. I was one of several university vice presidents who sat as part of the presidentâs cabinet. The first thing I did was try and get a handle on what the pieces were. The big pieces were the Dean of Students Office, the Office of the Dean of Admission, the Office of Financial Aid, and the Advising Centerâno, excuse meâand the Office of Registrar. Those were the big pieces there. Actually, the Advising Center moved into that orbit as we restructured things. It was a time at which a couple of people said it was time for them to move on: Jim Lyons [James W. Lyons], who had been the dean of students, who had, by far, the largest organization of the entities that were within student resources, and Jean Fetter, the dean of admission. During that time, I had the responsibility to see that searches occurred for both the dean of admission and the dean of students. Those were faculty-led searches. Tom Wasow was the professor who chaired the admission search committee. Condi Rice [Condoleezza Rice], who had just returned from her stint at the National Security Office, was also a member of that committee. The chair of the dean of students search was Lincoln Moses. So we had good people who agreed to proceed with that. As those searches were going on, I with others in the budget committee were wrestling with the pieces of the budget that came to us. It became necessary to slow the growth of student affairs, not so much admission, because the growth of the admission function was by virtue of the 104 constant increase in the size of the applicant pool. They were doing more not so much with less but without more. Since the proportion of students who needed financial aid was not so much growing, because the admitted population wasnât increasing so much but nonetheless had an impact in financial aid. In the Registrarâs Office we had some opportunities to use technology to substitute for other kinds of expenses; although the startup costs of technology are expensive, the results downstream are good. Tracy: Who did you end up bringing in for the dean of admission and the dean of students? Mahoney: [00:06:16] One of the applicants, and from the point of view of the search committee, the strongest applicant for the dean of admission position was Jim Montoya [James Montoya]. Jim had been a Stanford undergraduate who was very influential in how the university thought about the recruitment of Hispanic students, specifically Mexican-American students. As an undergraduate, he had found his way to a position on the Academic Councilâs Committee on Admission and Financial Aid; for the work he did there and the style of it and the impact it had, he was awarded a Dinkelspiel Prize. [00:07:15] When he left Stanford, Fred Hargadon had been instrumental in recommending Jim Montoya to Occidental College as an assistant in their admission office. Subsequently he became dean of admission there, working under President Slaughter [John Brooks Slaughter] who is a very distinguished liberal arts college president. 105 Then Jim [Montoya] went to Vassar, first as dean of admission and then as dean of students, which is where he was when the search commenced to find a successor to Jean Fetter. He was the choice of the search committee and I was delighted with that. There were good candidates so it was a good search. I called him. He said he knew he had the job because no one would call with bad news on the Fourth of July. He was just initiating a barbecue when I called. So that went well. The second search [for Dean of Students] involved both inside and outside candidates. Michael Jackson was appointed. He was certainly known in the environment. I think that people in Building 10 had worked with him. It was a constructive search. We moved to an issue that had come up from time to time but never been resolved over a lot of years in financial aid: the financial responsibility of the noncustodial parent in divorced and separated situations. The practice of the Ivy League and a variety of other private schools was to account for the capacity of the noncustodial parent as well as the custodial parent. That was not our practice. Our practice mirrored the general rules of the federal FAFSA [Free Application for Federal Student Aid] form where the responsibility was of the custodial parent. Many people at StanfordâDon Kennedy [Donald Kennedy] among them...when he married Robin she had two children and he became much more sympathetic to the question of what would you do in a situation that was hostile between the two parents. He didnât want to see college-bound students caught between their parents. 106 As it happened, I had an advisee who was a counterexample to that. I didnât know how many were like him but I felt it worth discussing. We didnât know, because we had no data, how much looking to the assets of the noncustodial parent would bring us if we took their capacity into account. We did have the sense that the custodial parent was typically the mother and that typically mothers made less than fathers. Thatâs all we knew. We didnât know what the reality of that was, especially if the noncustodial parent had moved on to a second family. I had an advisee whose mother and father both were Stanford classmates; they delivered him to school together, although they spent no time together when they arrived at the dorm. She was working as an administrative assistant in a small college. He was living alone in a condominium facing the ocean in Santa Monica. Both were very nice people. I met them both. They both came to Parentsâ Weekend, again separately, but they were both there. I managed to say hello to both. The father stayed over. The next thing I knew, the young man had a little Miata so he didnât have to ride his bike all the time, and he had $1,000+ skis to go skiing if he wanted to, and a rack on his Miata. So I used him as a sort of anecdotal example which amused people. I called this man, whose name I donât remember, and said, âYou do very nice things for your son. Why donât you support him in terms of the cost of education?â And he said quite matter-of-factly, âNobody ever has asked me to.â I said, âOh.â 107 So we began to ask ourselves âAre there others of him?â And if there areâand we donât want these young people caught between two parentsâ can we do this as a general policy to which the exemptions would be case-bycase? And thatâs what we tried. What theyâre doing now I donât know but that was one of the policy issues that I dealt with while I was doing that job. One of the things we did not do (it did not come up, though about four years later it did) and did not occur to us was to merge admission and financial aid. We wanted to maintain that separation that said admission makes its decisions cleanly and financial aid responds with a package for whomever it is admission admits. And itâs interesting to me that I have no recollection that that came up from anyone during that period of time. One kind of issue did and was responded to. The other did not but did four years later and I donât know the details of that. Both Bob Huff [Robert P. Huff] and Jim Montoya would be people who would know the answers to that. So those were the things I did in student resources. That organization later became vice provost for student something. So it was a vice president who reported to the provost as well as to...it was a little muddy. But it became a vice provost I think when Jim Montoya...or perhaps even during Mary Edmondsâs time. At the end of that time, I went over to the business school for a year and was part of the Sloan Program. It was a very interesting period and I am grateful to Jim Rosse and Don Kennedy for making that possible. It is a program that at the time was to commit you forever to your employer so you 108 could become the CEO of that company. The icon of the Stanford Sloan [Program] was Sir John Browne of British Petroleum [BP] who moved from a kind of lower senior management job at BP to the CEO of the corporation. So he was the model. I was never going to be the CEO of Stanford but I did have this arrangement for leaving the university: my plan was to stay in my home and do remediation work with schools that were on the cusp of trouble with their accreditors. I had done a lot of accreditations as Stanfordâs liaison. I had done one or two site visits a year to increasingly precarious institutions. My plan was to take formal retirement from Stanford and do this but I got a phone call one day from an executive-search person with whom I had been on a panel in Washington, DC, about women in higher education. She said to me, âSally, I want to talk to you about coming to Atlanta, Georgia.â I must have paused a very long time because her next words were, âItâs in the United States.â [Tracy laughs.] I said, âFor what reason?â She said, âAgnes Scott College needs an interim. It has gone through a bad time. Its faculty a year ago voted no confidence in its president. In Atlanta, when the faculty at Agnes Scott College are unhappy, the alumnae who largely live in Georgia are unhappy, and this is not good for the college. We need somebody who has a big view and can be a peacemaker and who, incidentally, can do strategic planning.â I said, âI donât have a PhD and this is a religious institution and I am not a Presbyterian.â 109 She said, âNo matter. Can I give the search committee your name?â I said, âYes.â The next thing I knew, Joe Gladden [Joseph R. Gladden Jr.], who was chairman of the board, called me. He was also the general counsel of the Coca-Cola Corporation, and his wife was an alum. We talked. He said, âDo you have any idea what an interim does?â I thought, âOh, I hope you know.â [Tracy laughs.] I said to him, âMaybe begin with the Hippocratic Oathâdo no harmâand then do some good if the trustees can say what that good is.â He asked me to visit. I did. They offered me the job. It was an absolutely splendid year. I brought skill sets and insights from Stanford that were useful to them. My experiences at Stanford had not been in a single departmentâtheyâd been wide-rangingâso I had a perspective. It was the year before the Olympics in Atlanta. It was very exciting. There were throwaway lines in my resume because somebody told me I needed to say something about my community involvement. I am a founding member of the Palo Alto University Rotary and was its president in 1989-90. I was the first woman president of a Rotary in this district and probably the second one in America (which probably means the world). People talked about that... trustees. Would I be willing to go to the Atlanta Rotary? And I said, âSure.â What that said was I had a community sense. What I had not understood was that the big downtown Rotary in Atlanta was one of two or three entities which had been absolutely influential in securing the Olympics. It was a place where black leadership in Atlanta 110 and white leadership could come together. Atlanta was a place, at least in the 1990s, where largely political Atlanta was African American but business Atlanta was still largely white. Rotary was one of the places where they came together. Agnes Scott College was another. So I became involved in all sorts of things having to do with the Olympics. Scott is the Wellesley of the South. Itâs academically very rigorous and it is very conscious of the civic responsibility of their students and alums. The college had said it would participate in President Carterâs Atlanta Project, overseeing the part of the project that was to be in Decatur. They assumed that, because there was a change in president, that would stop. I talked to the senior staff about it. It seemed to me that all the pieces were in place so there was no reason for me to say ânoâ to it. I wrote a letter to Mr. Carter saying we were prepared to continue as planned. That willingness to continue affected Atlanta. It was interesting what mattered. It said to Atlanta that Agnes Scott is not falling apart. They are continuing to do the things they had committed to. It said their president was willing to be involved. It said in the faculty thereâs continuity here, even though thereâs been a very disruptive change. They wanted a strategic plan. The guidelines of the strategic plan were as follows, which was interesting to me, given my various BAP [Budget Adjustment Program] and BEP [Budget Equilibrium Program] and other activities. This college was six hundred students. It had over $350 million in endowment. About two-thirds of that was Coca-Cola stock that could not be sold. So they wanted a strategic plan that would sharpen the focus of the 111 college by reducing courses, majors, and departments. That was the mandate. There was a trustee on the Strategic Planning Committee, as there had been on the last Policy Review Committee at Stanford, John Lilly. I thought, âHow are we going to get through this?â We solved the problem by late January. At the same time, the board was saying to me...the board had plenty of money for things that mattered but they were very frugal. If you had budget x, you didnât spend x plus y. They said to me that second meeting (I guess in Executive Committee) that they were concerned that the changes that Agnes Scott would be making couldnât be made effectively with some of the faculty we had. They had been around too long and could not make change. I said, âWhy donât you try an early retirement program.â So I talked to them about Stanfordâs early retirement program and how it had worked and how it had created payouts per individual. I thought I could work with the academic dean and the vice president for business and see if we couldnât come up with a proposal. I brought them a proposal probably just before Christmas. Down at the end of the table someone said, âThis is good provided that, when you bring us a list of names, the following names are on it.â He gave me two names. Everybody in the room froze. I said, âYou have to understand this is voluntary. We cannot prevent people from opting in that we would hate to see go nor can we make this involuntary, in which case you would have the problem that you would have firing anybody tenured. But let me see what I can do.â I knew that the two names that he had given me had come up as problematic in other settings. 112 The first of the two came along. He was looking for a way out. This retirement package provided what he needed. The other person was deeply conflicted and nothing was happening. One night I called the dean who had hired him (who subsequently became the president at another institution). I told him the story. I said, âYou have to help me.â He said he would. He called me one morning and said, âThis gentleman will be in your office about 8:30. He has written and I have watched him sign a letter requesting the program. My suggestion is that you have coffee and some sweet rolls ready for him and weâll see how it goes.â He came in. It was touch and go but it got accomplished. So I could go in to the board saying, âWe have to spend x.ââ$2.5 million, I think, was the payout for this program which they gladly wrote a check for. I looked down at the table and said, âThe list includes the names you mentioned in December.â Joe Gladden looked at me and said, âIt does?â I said, âYes.â So we got it done and, in the process, alumnae were happierâeverything was happier. They did a national search, and the faculty, having had a president they came to distrust, were preparing questions that would be appropriate to an inquisition. [00:30:31] I finally went to the faculty who were going to do some of this interviewing and said, ââInterviewâ means âbetween.â It doesnât mean âinquisition.â You have to remember that this faculty has voted no confidence in the president. This makes candidates leery. So you have to be on your 113 good, southern-hospitality behavior and moderate your questions. And you know how to do this,â as I knew they did. They all laughed, and they did it, and we got a wonderful president. She was an alumna of the college from the middle 1960s. She had been a Stanford graduate student working with Lyman Van Slyke, who I had known as my neighbor. Her husband had a degree in American history from Stanford, a PhD. [After] I left, I stayed connected to Agnes Scott. I was there late last spring for an alumnae weekend. The trustees and the faculty and a variety of others had a series of events for me. It was a very, very good experience. If you were going to transition out of Stanford, this was a very good place to have done it. It was intellectually rigorous. It understood money. It understood relationships. It was religious in a way that I came to appreciate when I went off to two Catholic schools. Far better was their board at dealing with issues of religion than were the two Catholic schools I went to. I learned a great deal in Atlanta. I learned how to work with a board that was smaller. I think I was accepted in part because I had come from Stanford. In fact, I have a little faculty resolution in my office that says, âShe came from afar from a distinguished place but she didnât look down on us.â [00:33:22] That kind of thing. But there was no reason to look down on them. They were, and still are, very, very good. I shocked them by saying, âWe ought to increase the size of the student body,â at the same time we were reducing courses, majors, and departments. I argued that the school was so small that, at the major level, classes were so small that no student had a 114 place to hide. You had to be prepared every day in everything and I thought that added to the stress of the place. They had an honor code. I was familiar with an honor code. We had many things [in common]. It taught me that skills are transferrable from places that you would think are quite unlike. I donât think the transition from private to public or public to private would be as easy but private to private value structures are similar even though orders of magnitude are not. So that was that place. As I was getting ready to leave Agnes Scott, I got a letter from a person in Milwaukee who said he was on the board and chair of the Finance Committee of a school called Mount Mary College in Milwaukee. I called him and asked him why he thought he needed an interim because by this time I had learned that the first thing you do is look to see if there is somebody inside who can hold the place together. When Wally Sterling [J. E. Wallace Sterling] left the presidency, Dr. Glaser [Robert J. Glaser] came in as the interim for a year while we were looking for the appointment that turned out to be Ken Pitzer [Kenneth S. Pitzer]. The first question was, âWhy not an insider?â and his response to that was, âBecause thereâs blood on the floor.â [00:35:29] They had done a search. Their last president had been a Sister, a member of the religious order that had founded the institution. She told them when she was sixty-eight that she would retire at seventy and they should start thinking about a search. She did the right thing. They limited the search to sisters and, even fifteen years ago, that was a small pool and an even smaller one now. They came up dry and then tried to 115 recover from that by doing a second search that was even worse than the first. By this time, all of Milwaukee knew it was a mess. The faculty were unhappy. The faculty did not believe they could be the same kind of school if there was not a sister in the presidentâs office. I had done a fair amount of work as a trustee or in other respects and I had a done a lot of accrediting of denominational schools including Catholic ones. So I went up and talked to them and I talked to the faculty. I realized very quickly when I got there and I said to the board in October, âI hope we like one another well enough because to do what you want me to do, which is ready the institution for a lay president (I think thatâs what you want), is going to take two years. The reason it is going to take two years is that the presidential search cycle is an autumn cycle where you winnow your candidates sometime in early December and have candidates come in January. If they are not successful in seeking a presidency, they can say to the president who let them go off on these search excursions, âIâm prepared to stay another year.â If you start looking in April, those people have signed contracts. Ethically you get a problematic pool or in terms of quality you get a problematic pool.â So they all agreed. I had, as a condition of coming, gotten them to agree that, when they got around to doing a search, they would hire a search firm. I was prepared to help them do that but that this [had been] amateur night and, if repeated, would have a similar result. They were grateful for that. 116 There were issues there in addition to religious leadership. They had an investment policy that was antiquated despite the fact the board was very financially savvy. So we changed investment policies. We also did a strategic plan. I said that the college should join a library consortium. Our librarians some ten years before had organized and then, for reasons incomprehensible to me, the college wouldnât sign the contractual document that made them part of the consortium. Various people came to me and said, âYou missed an opportunity ten years ago. Would you reconsider?â We did. What it meantâand it was a simple thing because there are several small colleges in the Milwaukee areaâwas that we created a common library database. You could look in the database and say, âWhat I want is at x of these colleges, it is on the shelf, it is not out, and I will put a claim on it.â If you put a claim on it, it would be delivered to your campus library within twenty-four hours. It was a very slick system. It meant that distinctive or even unique collections that might be in one institution but not getting a lot of use could be made available to others without a lot of hassle. It was an important element. In the second year, the board and its search committee, which included faculty and students and alumni and the usual suspects, hired a search firm, a very good one, and got three splendid candidates. Faculty were coming into my office saying, âWe feel so badly. Only one of them can be chosen and we have to reject the others.â [Tracy laughs.] 117 And I said, âDonât worry. Each of these women will have a presidency within six weeks.â Mahoney: We got a splendid president. During my tenure there, I arrived to discover that the vice president for finance was going to Florida with his wife and we hadnât closed the books. I arranged to have that done and hired a vice president for business. I discovered that we were without a leader of our development function. No one told me the position was empty until I said, âWho is coming to the presidentâs cabinet meeting for development?â My secretary said, âOh, that position is vacant.â âOh.â [Tracy laughs] [00:41:46] I did a search and hired a woman named Mary Finger who had just finished doing the fundraising effort in support of Northwestern [Universityâs] undergraduate library and so was ready to move on. She was originally from Milwaukee so it was coming home for her. We developed a pretty sophisticated small school fundraising program, which startled people. I realized we were going to have to try and bring to the board people who knew that this was important. Mary did a wonderful job of that. She stayed on with my successor for ten years. The year after Pat [Patricia OâDonoghue] got there, which was the year after I left, they started a $15 million campaign but raised $32 million. Mary was a terrific fundraiser. [00:42:57] After Pat left the presidency, she [Mary] went down to DePaul University, where she is presently. 118 [Mary Finger] has just been named president of Seton Hill University in Pennsylvania to which she is going in August. So she was a very good hire. Again, a different kind of place. We worked with the faculty on the fact that they were the culture carriers of this religious tradition and what that meant. I went to sisters who were in the retirement home of the congregation. We did a number of things that helped that along. Although none of the candidates, including the appointee, had ever worked with this particular congregation of sisters, all of them understood the issue and knew what you did to engage that tradition as part of the mission of the institution. I said to the board, âThis congregationâs leadership, which is not at the college (it is close by with more general responsibilities), cannot function here by benign neglect. Itâs got to say, âWe support you.ââ And that was done. My Stanford experience was interesting and did not need to be brought to [bear in this regard] at Agnes Scott. Agnes Scott is right up there, because this was an institution founded to memorialize a person who was the mother of one of the founders. At Mount Mary, they didnât have any sense of founder. And I thought, âWe have to connect people not to the last president but to a long tradition.â One day I was in the basement with some people. There were, as there always are in basements, these nineteenth-century oil paintings with gilded frames. Stanford Museum is filled with them. They were of nuns! I said, âWho are these people?â âThis is Sister Theresa,â of something or other, âand Sister Imelda,â of something or other. 119 I said, âWho were they?â Somebody said to me, âOne of them is the founder of the college.â I said, âWhy is her portrait in the warehouse, basically?â We pulled them out, put them up in a lounge area, and put a sign next to them that said, âThese two sisters are part of our history. If you want to know something about them, there will be coffee and cookies at four oâclock on Thursday afternoon.â The word went out to the retirement center and four or five sisters showed up as well as probably about forty people from the college. [00:46:54] I said, âIâm told that this one is Sister Theresa, the founder of this place, and this other sister came with her. Who knows anything?â And these old sisters started to talk. So they promised to bring us documents. They promised to bring us pictures that had been taken from the college and brought out to the mother house because they thought no one cared. When someone said, âWhy did you do that?â I said, âOnce a year Stanford honors the founders. There is a tradition of a service at Memorial Church and then a procession from Memorial Church to the mausoleum, where we are greeted by the head of the Stanford Historical Society, who reads the Stanford founding grant to us. Then the gates to the mausoleum are opened, and we go and we thank Big Leland and Little Leland and Jane âand Janeâs brother is there as well.â I said, âSo Iâm used to talking about a place having values that are connected to its founders.â 120 People thought that was interesting. For me, it was just an everyday way of thinking. It is an example of a Stanford experience translating for me to make something useful for a college that had lost its sense of its history. That was one of the things I did for them. Of course (one always knows this) elderly sisters in retirement homes have friends in the lay community. The word went out that, whoever she was over there, somebody should show up at the next alumnae meeting because she was doing some good things. When they showed up, I would talk about this. I would also say, âWe need to find waysâyou as alums, me as the presidentâto make our faculty empowered as the custodians of this tradition.â Goodness knows, the traditionâand this is true of the history of women religious across this countryâwas that these were very young women who showed up, usually from Europe, to do something utterly dauntingâfounding institutionsâwhich they did. People need to know about that. So thatâs what I did for Mount Mary: their investment policy; their sense of who they were; the sense of the facultyâs empowerment; and the sense that they could ask for money and they would get it because they had a good story to tell. That was them. As I was getting ready to leave Mount Mary (and again [assuming] I was coming back here to my house on campus and [doing] this accreditedinstitution-in-trouble thing), I got a call from the same executive search person who had brought me to Agnes Scott. 121 This time she was doing a search in Texas at Our Lady of the Lake University. I went there. It was quite different. It had a really effective board of laypeople with a few sisters for a long, long time. It had been coed not so much by choice as by circumstance but for thirty years so they knew what they were doing. They were on the west side of San Antonio in the barrio. They were perceived as really caring about first-generation kids. San Antonio only graduates from high school 45 percent of the kids who start the ninth grade. [00:51:36] San Antonio is not an immigrant city. Immigrants go north. They go up Highway 35. They go to Chicago. They go various places. So you have multiple generations of Mexican Americans without education. It is a military town so many people have gone into the military and the military pays to educate people. I went expecting an Anglo-Hispanic divide. That is not the divide in San Antonio. The divide is class. It is between no education (Anglo or Hispanic) and education. Our Lady of the Lake had, twenty years before I got there, opened something that was really unusual and innovative in San Antonio. They had created a weekend college where people who were employed full-time didnât come to school at night [but rather] came on weekends for really intense programs. Many of them were people who had done a year or two of college somewhere but couldnât continue to afford it or for whatever reason had found themselves not finishing. They worked for places like USAA, the insurance company, that were prepared to support their tuition as a staff benefit. 122 One of those was Enron. We had seven hundred students on three campusesâone in Dallas, one in Houston, and the main campus in San Antonioâfrom Enron. When they imploded, we kept anybody who had one year left. We said to the others, âYou have got to pay tuition.â But they did not have any money to pay tuition because they did not have jobs. It hit Texas like an A-bomb going off. I had met Ken Lay [Kenneth Lee Lay] many times. The issues at Our Lady of the Lake were strategic planning, consistency of enrollment, how to think about the fact that we were close to the border, and that we were educating people who were working with people who were cross-border people. Tracy: San Antonio is right down on the border? Mahoney: [00:54:22] No, it is 3 1/2 hours from Laredo and Nuevo Laredo. Everyone there, although now itâs a mess, talks about one city in two countries. If youâve been listening to KQED, Steve Inskeep, one of the people on [National Public Radioâs Morning Edition], has been visiting the border and he talked about [Ciudad] JuÃ¡rez and El Paso. Tracy: El Paso. Thatâs what Iâm thinking of. Mahoney: [00:55:00] It was clear from the tone of [Inskeepâs] voice that he was shocked. It shocked me when I went. You stand at the top floor, which has windows around all sides, at the Holiday Inn in El Paso at night and you look into a vast expanse of lights every bit as big as Los Angeles. Weâre talking about millions of people across the border and weâre talking about El Paso 123 [with] several hundred thousand people. People come back and forth all the time. I would go to Laredo. We had just under a thousand alums in Mexico. We had programs that were keyed to the border. We had a PsyD degree in which we trained people to be counseling psychologists. If they were going to work, particularly along the border in the colonias between Brownsville and Laredo or west to El Paso, they were going to be dealing with people who got medical care in Mexico. Because they were uninsured in Texas, they went across the border and paid cash for whatever treatment they needed, including psychological services. We needed to work with professionals on the other side of the border. I should say also that professionals on the Mexican side of the river are highly trained, many of them in the United States, many of them in Canada. This image that people have of when you cross the border thereâs great decline...there are places in great decline in Mexico but professional services by doctors and psychologists is not among them. Theyâre very good. We needed to know how they worked and so we did two things. We had a bilingual, bicultural certification in our PsyD degree and in several of our masterâs degrees so that people could work with people who were bilingual or monolingual Spanish but, more importantly, sought services on the other side. That meant we made inter-institutional agreements with universities on the other side: Monterrey Tech [Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education; TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey] in LeÃ³n and in Monterrey; and Mayab University [Anahuac Mayab University; 124 Universidad AnÃ¡huac Mayab] which is a private Catholic university in MÃ©rida near Cancun. Part of what we needed to do as our strategy was to say what was our relationship going to be to the border. Up to then we had satellite campuses in Dallas and Houston (Houston is border but a different kind of border.). So those kinds of things went along. I became very involved in civic affairs. The president [Sister Elizabeth Anne Sueltenfuss], my predecessor, had been an elected member of the San Antonio Library Commission. She was also a âSueltenfussâ which was a very well-known German name in south Texas so people talked about President Sueltenfuss all the time. I was drawn in to a number of boards...the United Way of Bexar County...all sorts of things. I was involved in trade missions to Mexico. I saw NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] in a very different light when I went to San Antonio. When the business community put together a trade mission to Mexico, their trade mission always included some cultural people by which they meant museum, higher education, and symphony peopleâthat was âculture.â I did not speak Spanish. I understood some. All the Mexicans spoke English but there is some politeness in doing some Spanish so I learned a little Spanish. I did an intensive three-weeks in Cuernavaca one summer. I made common cause with the public institutions. I wrote interinstitutional agreements not only with the San Antonio community colleges 125 but with El Paso and Houston because the issue is how to get firstgeneration students to degrees. Because the Texas legislature does not support financial aid for Texans very well, students graduating from Texas [public] universities wind up with bigger loans than students graduating from Our Lady of the Lake. So we made that case as part of our campaigns. After we did our strategic plan, it was clear to me that [they needed] someone who was going to be around for at least another ten years which I was not prepared to be and needed to move on. [While] I had not been hired to be an interim president, we were all interim and it is a good thing to know when to go away. My successor [Tessa Martinez Pollack] was Mexican American and spent 11 1/2 years. Thereâs now an interim [Sister Jane Ann Slater] and theyâre going to be looking for another president. I go back to San Antonio from time to time. My predecessor [Sister Sueltenfuss] was seventy-five when she retired. For her eighty-fifth, various people decided to put together a fundraising scholarship dinner that would honor her. I flew there for that dinner. She was fine. She steeled herself to get enough energy to be able to sit up on the dais and to be able to speak. She was getting more and more fragile but it was a wonderful evening. I had a table with a variety of people who knew me. I came away from that feeling that the work I had done there had been helpful to where they were going next. She died within a year of that event. They had raised a half a million dollars. In San Antonio, Texas, given what salaries are and what the cost of living is, half a million dollars in one night is a lot of money. 126 [01:03:20] I then came home, for family reasons. I actually stayed in San Antonio two years after I left Our Lady of the Lake and finished up with some boards and did some pro bono work with a number of places. Then my sister was ill so I came home; got involved with the Catholic community at Stanford; got involved with the school where I am a member of the board in San Francisco; have since gotten involved with Stevenson House in Palo Alto; and [have] reconnected to my Rotary and to Belle Haven/Ravenswood [City School] District. I keep busyâand now with the [Stanford] Historical Societyâso thatâs my story. Tracy: Iâm trying to think of anything big to go back to or any last questions that I had. In reading some articles in preparation for today, I was reminded that you came to Stanford on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship in English. [laughs] Did you ever have any sense then that you would...? Mahoney: [01:04:44] Oh, no. You have to remember that not only did I come to Stanford originally to study English [but also] that my first Stanford job was as director of Branner Hall [although] I had no undergraduate experience of having ever lived in a dorm. [I had no] idea that I would be âwaylaid into administrationâ which is how Albert Guerard [Stanford English professor] used to put it. He was happy to [see me] do it because the English department felt it needed a friend in âthe administration,â as lowly as I was in the administration. [Tracy laughs.] Gradually the work became interesting and the possibility of contribution became more interesting than going back to the English department. 127 People in the three places where I served as interim [president] noticed I had had a Woodrow Wilson and everyone knew that was a great prestige. Our Lady of the Lake kept asking me when I was going to finish my degree. I would say, âThatâs long gone.â In between, I had done this degree in the business school, which made trustees very happy. One of the trustees at Our Lady of the Lake was a person who was working for AT&T (which was called SBC at the time) and it had relocated from St. Louis to San Antonio. He looked at my rÃ©sumÃ© and he said, âWhat did being in the Sloan Program teach you?â I thought: thatâs an interesting thing to find out of my rÃ©sumÃ©. Itâs a little bit like Agnes Scott having found my Rotary presidency. I said, âI can speak academy to business and business to the academy.â He said, âOh, thatâs a good answer.â After the meeting broke up, I discovered he had been a Stanford Sloan [Fellow] three years earlier. So he would have noticed it. Tracy: [As] a woman in the administration, were there many other women around? We sort of know the story of Lucille Allen. Mahoney: [01:07:27] No, there werenât. I never noticed it except when people pointed things out to me. What I noticed in the early daysâthe SES [Study of Education at Stanford] daysâwhen I would be brought into meetings because I had âsomething to sayâ [was] that mostly everybody else in the room were men. What I really noticed was that they were twice my age. There was an age difference that I was far more aware of than I was of the gender difference. So that was one piece of it. 128 The nightâand I may have spoken of this earlierâthat the faculty had a farewell dinner at the Faculty Club for Ken Pitzer, there were not a dozen women in the room. There must have been three hundred people in the room, in the big gold dining room. They were Eleanor Maccoby (who had been on the Advisory Board), Alberta Siegel, Liz Cohen [Elizabeth G. Cohen], Leah Kaplan, Mary Sunseriânot the two assistant professors in English who were Diane Middlebrook and Anne Mellor [Anne Kostelanetz Mellor]âI did notice that. I was sitting with Joel [Joel Pritchard Smith] and various [other] people. What I did notice was that people did not bring their wives. The invitation I had received said, âThis invitation is for the addressee only. We do not have room for other guests.â Some number of years later, Alberta Siegel told me that had spouses come Pitzer would have felt the need to bring his wife, who was very, I think, shocked by what was happening and who would have burst into tears from time to time. No one wanted that to happenâI am sure most of all Ken [Pitzer] himselfâso it was, âThe invitation is for the addressee only.â [01:10:15] That was a point at which I was aware of gender. When Dick Lyman [Richard W. Lyman] offered me the job in his office as assistant provost and director of summer session, he told me that he had touched base with the deans I would be working with in the four schools that had summer session and that no one had any objection. I thought that was nice. What someone later told me was that he was a little leery because the person he had touched base with in the School of Engineering was very 129 leery of women administrators, for religious as well as other reasons. But at no point did I have any hint of that. The other place I had gotten sort of...I though it charming because he was quite elderly. James T. Watkins IV, who was, in the 1950s and 1960s, everybodyâs favorite professor in poli-sci, sent me one of these courtesy notes. [He said] that he had seen the notice that I would become the director of summer session. He welcomed that. He wanted me to know that he was teaching summer session that summer. He said what he was teaching. He said he looked forward to being one of the faculty who worked for Stanfordâs first female dean, signed âJames T. Watkins IV.â I just thought it was an elderly manâs courtesy note, which it was. Its significance did not wash over me for a long time because other people were thinking that who were not saying it. Howard Brooks, who was vice provost, said to me one day just as he was leaving StanfordâI had known his daughter when she was a resident in Roble Hall and I was the director; I knew his wife was on the faculty at San Jose Stateâthat I had solved (as you know) the womenâs P.E. problem, or at least I had advanced its remedy. He thanked me. He said that, some years before when he was quite junior and part of Fred Termanâs [Frederick Emmons Terman] staff, there was someone who had just gotten a PhD, a woman, whom he proposed to Terman come into the Provostâs Office to help him with a project. Shortly thereafter, someone in Building 10 had called him in and said that was not to be. The presidentâs administrative assistant was already in the Presidentâs Office and that was enough. He said, âSo we 130 didnât hire her, and I was much too juniorâ (he was new in the office) âto do anything about it.â He wanted me to know that things had changed and he was pleased. I just said, âThank you, and good luck as you go down to the Claremont Colleges.â What could I say? There were always those kinds of things but never once in my day-today working relationships in the Provostâs Office. Business and finance was a little different, but only parts of it. Certainly by the late 1960s nobody in student affairs thought this odd. But there simply werenât very many. When I started, I was more aware of age than I was gender. I became more aware of gender as we began to look at faculty. We began to look at why women were stuck in lectureship roles or research associate roles when they could be faculty. Why did the wife of that man in the medical school come up in a search but could not be appointed because there was a nepotism law that did not really exist. I became aware of those kinds of things gradually. I never felt they affected me in any adverse way. Tracy: Another sort of broader question is about how the students changed. I know Stanford made explicit efforts to diversify the student body. Outside of what Stanford was doing, [more generally how did] the student body change over the years? Mahoney: [01:16:30] As we extended our recruitment reach, it is the caseâwhether it is Harvard or usâthat a large segment of your student body will come from within 450 miles of your campus. Now, that is multiple states if you are 131 Harvard and it is California and Hawaii and a little bit of Nevada if you are Stanford. So when you count states, it comes up different. As we recruited more broadly, we picked up not only students of color (whom we were actively recruiting) but also we picked up white students... we picked up, as we talked about need-blind admissions, people who thought you had to be rich to go to Stanford. As the pool got larger, we could select and still have a diverse student body with stronger and stronger studentsâ students who had breadth as well as depth. Certainly that was obvious as you moved along. Since I began advising freshman in 1964 or 1965 and did it until 1992, I can tell you that my advisees got better and better and better. They also got entrepreneurialâthe individually designed majorâthe âI want to go co-term but in a field different from my undergraduate fieldââthe âI want to go overseas, but I donât want to go to a Stanford program; how can I do that?ââthose kinds of things. By the time I got to Stanford, there was a core of [special] students. It is why I want to add, if you do not have it already, the name of Dwight Clark, to the names of people who know something about Stanford students. He is still around. I saw him not long ago. He started out as an assistant dean of men, director of Wilbur Hall at Stanford. What he is important for is Volunteers in Asia [VIA], which had an enormous impact on the student body at Stanford. When I look at VIA and look at people now in their fifties, VIA had an enormous impact. 132 When I say entrepreneurial and prepared to work and to expect to be able to work with the university, with faculty, Tom Fox [now the publisher of the National Catholic Reporter] and the students who worked with faculty to bring about the policy on a pan-denominational approach to nondenominational Stanford [were] enormously impactful. People like Tom and this other student, Steve Martindale, who did that [expected] to be able to sit down with a couple of key faculty members, lay out their vision, and, if they could join together, something would happen. There were more and more people willing to speak up for what would be important elements of education without having it spoon-fed to them. Some old things continue. People were very kind to one another. People thought it was important to have fun. The sort of faÃ§ade of Stanfordâyou run, you play tennis, you do all these things, you are very good at whatever, and you kind of study when you canâwas the image in the East. What I knew (and I certainly observed firsthand when I became a resident fellow 1980 to 1983) [was that] that was bogus. Students did all those things (running and playing tennis and the violin and whatever) but they got up at four in the morning and were in various parts of the dorm studying in little groups together and working on problem sets. People did not study after 9:00 at night because that was when the dorm had its social life. Nobody had a social life at 7:00 at night; it was 9:00-10:00. People worked very, very hard but it was taken for granted and, hence, not talked about. 133 So I think over time adults got enamored of Stanford because they could come and play tennis in February. Better and better students came and by the 1980s we were seeing the children of really important people from the East Coast at Stanford. Some of them were Stanford alums. Justice Breyerâs [Stephen Breyer] son was at Stanford and he had been a Stanford undergraduate. News anchors had children at Stanford. All sorts of people came west, some from prep schools and many from public schools. [Because of] that effort through the 1970s and into the 1980s in which we expanded our recruitment, things just got better and better. The quality of the students got better. But there continued to be a sense that Stanford had a fundamental standard and a culture in which people were to care about one another. It was not considered seemly to try and do in your classmates in a class. Those kinds of things that people talked about happening elsewhere may have happened but it was not part of the culture of the place. Those are the changes that I noticed. Tracy: Being from Nevada, certainly I knew about Stanford. Stanford was in my world view but I remember when Chelsea Clinton came to Stanford that, for me, was... Mahoney: [01:25:01] We, by then, had a center in Washington, and there were lots and lots of Stanford people all over Washington: in the Supreme Court, in the Senate, in the Congress, Dianne Feinstein, all of them, Frank Church from Idaho. People used to laugh and said that Chelsea went to college as far west as she could in the Lower 48. My guess is that is probably true. But Sidwell 134 Friends [School] sent all sorts of students here so it was not as if she was the lone wolf from that school. But, yes, people began to hear prominent names. I began to notice the Washington names when we began to get people who either needed Secret Service protection or some other kind of protection, or students who needed to take their names out of the public directories because people were worried that their presence would be noted. That happened after the Patty Hearst kidnapping because of the way that those abductors found Patty Hearst. They simply went to Sproul Hall and looked at an open directory and got her address and phone numberâwhich is something you could have done at Stanford any day of the week. The Buckley Amendment allowed you to hold your records private but not many people thought to do that. But when people started coming from places of prominence, some adopted different names, for example, Rockefeller. Her father knew the thendirector of the Food Research Institute. She adopted a different kind of last name. She lived off campus and, if anybody had known who she was, she was ripe for kidnapping. When her father would come to visit, this man from Food Research would call me. I would put out the word through a group I knew she had contact with. They would meet. [It was] very strange. The Dean of Students Office knew nothing about it. He trusted the registrar to hold this. But her records, her changed-name records, were out in public. The fact that there was a name change was in Bob Houghtonâs secret file. We saw more of that. 135 [00:00:00] Of course, with someone like Chelsea Clinton we saw the Secret Service. We had a question about that raised when Breyer went to the Supreme Court. I remember when that young man got a call from his mother. He was in one of the houses were Mark Mancall had been the resident fellow. His mother said, âGo to the airport and get on the red-eye, and please bring appropriate clothes âa white shirt and tie and a good blazer and shined shoesâbecause we are all going to the White House tomorrow.â Instantly Mancall knew what that meant, but he [the student] had outgrown his blazer. It was like that. [Tracy laughs.] What was interestingâand this is my idea of a Stanford freshman dormâword went out that he needed to get to Washington appropriately clothed. He also needed a haircut and the barbershop was closed. This is 6:00 at night in a FloMo [Florence Moore] dorm. He had to be on a plane at 10:00. There appeared in his room an appropriately sized jacket, a shirt that fit. He had a tie. His shoes fit. He had all these things. Some student from the end of the hall had scissors and cut his hair. He went off to the airport. People coming together to say, âWeâve got to help you,â was a very Stanford thing to do, but Iâm not sure it would happen in a Berkeley dorm or even in a USC dorm. No one said, âHeâs going to Washington because his fatherâs going to have a federal appointment.â Mancall thought he knew what it was but we all had to wait to see it on TV the next day. People watching TV were not impressed with his father. People said [of the student], âHe looks good.â So 136 that culture which I attribute to the old Stanford was maintained even with a much more high-powered student body...
